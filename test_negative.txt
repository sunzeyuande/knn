the beginning of this book was excellent ,  but dont be fooled ,  the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book .   the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers .  what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were .   this was one of the worst books i have ever read ,  i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery .  dont waste your time reading it
in addition to the errors listed by others ,  i see missing letters in the middle of words ,  quote marks that are the wrong style  ( backticks instead of curly quotes ,  done inconsistently )  ,  inconsistent indentations  .  .  .  it's a typesetting nightmare .   big disappointment
this book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money .  page 364 :   principles of long term investing :    " chapter 8 shows that among the s&p 500 index returns ,  large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks .  "   now look at chapter 8 .    " of the 10 largest corporations ,  only 2   ( exxon mobile and citigroup )  are value stocks .  "   duuhhh .   now i know what to do .   i have a choice of two stocks .   if you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket ,  buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart .  if you know little ,  it won't add to your knowledge at all
sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing the guardian .  this book is awful .  the storyline is weak and predictable ,  the dialogue is excruciatingly lame ,  and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry .  there is virtually no romance ,  which is the reason to read sparks' books .  i can't tell you how many times i rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said ,  the way the dog seems to be human ,  and the predictability of the plot .  this book is so poorly written and so lame i have trouble believing sparks wrote it .  if you want a good plot with romance mixed in ,  read message in a bottle or a walk to remember .  if you want suspense ,  read mary higgins clark or agatha christie ;  they do a far better job with it than sparks does .
i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book ,  the killer angels .   it is not fair to compare the two ,  but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one ,  i thought i should mention it .   this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book .   it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg ,  so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle .   but the result is a less satisfying book .   it skims rather than digs deep
this is a story of the lives of 5 people who attended college with the author during the early 1980s in post cultural revolution china .   the 5 people live relatively miserable lives ,  touched by official corruption and incompetence  ( with the exception of one who benefits handsomely )  .   china is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality ,  with widespread corruption ,  and widespread incompetence .   this view is difficult to reconcile with the economic development and obvious progress that has occurred there in the past 20 years .   this book is an interesting read as gossip often can be ,  but it is doubtful the 5 people portrayed represent present day china
before i started reading  " zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance ,  "  the book had a lot going for it :  stellar reviews on the cover ,  an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at walden books in pocatello .unfortunately ,  despite these advantages ,  the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment .  don't get me wrong ,  it wasn't terrible ,  it just wasn't very good .i'm not sure whether the book is a memoir ,  a novel or a philosophical treatise .  in  " zen "  robert pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son ,  chris in the 1970s .  but the story ,  i guess ,  is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology .the only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17 :" the buddha ,  the godhead ,  resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower .  "that passage is good .  the rest of the book is depressing and confusing .  throughout the entire motorcycle trip ,  the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of  " quality .  "i'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel ,  but if it was ,  it failed to produce character growth .  it's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better .  the author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer .whatever the book was supposed to be ,  it didn't impressed me .
pinching a child's trapezius muscle ?  hitting him or her with a belt or a stick hard enough for it to hurt ?  james dobson should be put away .raising children this way may make them obedient to their parents ,  but they will be prone to abuse others once they reach adulthood .  look at adolf hitler and saddam hussein .at best ,  children who are physically abused will grow up to practice bsdm .this book deserves no stars
i read this book and i think presented material is not practical in commercial applications .  in my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications .  i know this is something different from contracts ,  by i think contracts are to complex ,  hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems .for me another problem with contracts is problem in describing complex constraint that exists in problem domain .  for example how to describe that objects must be cloned ,  not passed by reference or how to check that objects holded by readonly list not change their state during operations on list ?regards ,marci
as a certified information systems security professional ,  i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever .  i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here ,  and i'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it .the most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle  " an integrated approach to security in the organization .  "  the book not only lacks effective security integration techniques ,  it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration .
while this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others ,  in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers don't exist .   i'll admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality ,  but just how far can we take this kind of analysis ?   the author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same-sex parent ,  he can determine the birth order of your ideal match .   my father was 3rd and i was 2nd ,  thus i should pair with a 4th born .   anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo-science .   there are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions .   not every nth born is the same ,  and no relationship between nth and mth borns can be analysed this way .   as with astrology ,  the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong  " sign "  .   who's to say i won't get along with a 2nd born ?   rather than relying on voodoo like this ,  we are better off just paying attention to how we actually get along with other individuals
what a waste of time .  this was like sitting through a very boring business course .  i was never interested in turning the page .  i would have liked to see more of carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story . instead i felt like a robot was telling this story . very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else .  i forced myself to finish this .  a huge diaappointment . don't waste your money
there are two things which tickle me about this book .   one is the sample zack's report at the back which has a strong buy #1 rating on a - . 3% return on equity stock .   the other is the section on practical use of the system .   it ,  of course ,  is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 - 3 months .   and don't forget about growth investors and value investors either .   this section is so short as to be laughable .   also notice that in the 2002 a list there were 216 stocks .   most are going to have to buy a subset .   but what subset ?   no info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class .   perhaps an mvo addict or a monte carlo hack would have the answer
this is a badly written ,  repetitive and self-serving account ,  largely ,  of the foolishness of &quot ; portflio insurance . &quot ;  that things which are &quot ; just like&quot ;  something else may not be so in reality ,  and that  magic fixes in the market  ( which after all fly in the face of the  rational-expectations/efficient-market hypotheses which often are built  into the view of the market being relied on )  i guess needs to be pointed  out regularly ,  since hope of quick ,  uninformed ,  and painless fixes seem to  reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed  on .  jacobs does point out such problems for a particular ,  rather bizarre  episode ,  and suggests ,  not too coherently ,  that such &quot ; scams&quot ;  are  still prevalent .  however ,  he does this in a horribly repetitive and  self-laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued
as a professional ,  certified chef and baker ,  i am also an avid baking and cookbook collector .  after seeing that this book won and the james beard and the 'iacp cookbook of the year' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too good to be true'-reviews on amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if peter reinhart is the jesus christ of bread- i finally decided to buy this expensive book .what a dissappointment !  for all those blindly following reinhart as he were the saviour of true bread ,  wake up !  reinhart's book is simply flawed .  compared to other bread books ,  it's even a quite average book .  but one that is luxuriously packaged .  a lot of hot colorful expensive air .  and it's expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it ,  but because of the super luxuriously editing .  this is a book for book enthousiasts ,  not for bakers ,  professional or home .i see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools ,  as information and inspiration .  not as eye candy .  if you want nice pictures ,  buy an art book .  a book on baking bread with these awards behind it ,  should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques ,  original insights ,  an appetite for baking ,  factual info ,  the newest and tested developments in technique .  .  .  what you get here is a fluffed up egotrip .  47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30-40$ publishing hype .don't get me wrong :  this is a beautiful ,  expensive book .  but one you don't use in the kitchen ,  and certainly don't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about .  but as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge ,  giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques ,  as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery ,  compared to other bread books ,  this book fails miserably info-wise .  but it has a snappy lay out .jeff hamelmans 'bread ,  a book of techniques' and rose beranbaums 'bread bible' give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking .  they talk more about the subject 'bread' .  and not about themselves like peter reinhart clearly relishes .  mr reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in paris .  how about the bread info ,  the kneading ,  rising ,  baking ,  ingredient- and techniques info ?  i honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin .  bakers with such big ego's that think that readers of a bread baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during 'a learning trip' to professional bakers on which she accompanied him ,  than in another bread formula's ,  should work in shobizz ,  not in a bakery or a culinary school .  big ego's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry .  reinart is ,  judging by this book ,  sadly also one of them .  i don't see in a 1000 years rose beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or jeff hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in paris .  mr . reinhart :  your readers forked out 30-40$ for bread info ,  not your personal travel experiences .  as you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil :  stay with the subject !  and the subject of this book ,  for which i paid is 'bread and baking .  if we want to know about your personal life ,  we'll read an interview in people ,  if they find you interesting enough .peter reinharts 'the bread baker's apprentice' as a 'bread book' is simply a marketing creation .  smartly edited ,  but way too short on substance .  there is not much new information on bread .  worse :  there is not much info at all !  in total for 30-40 $ ,  you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by ten speed press ,  the editor or this book .  compared to beranbaums 640 pages ,  hamelmans 400 plus pages ,  that is a big difference for a big price .  with reinharts book ,  you get a lot of shining white surface that in other bread books is filled with bread info .  as a buyer of this book ,  you also pay for full page black-and-white and color pictures that are pure filler .  see p .  3 ,  6 ,  26 .  .  .  and why is the beautiful model fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr .  reinhart himself or even  .  .  .  bread alone ?  with reinharts next book they will no doubt put kate moss in an apron and a bakers vest .  package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30-40$ .  never mind the content .let's talk a bit about the formula's .  that should be an important part of a baking book ,  right ?  and they should be original and fine tuned ,  right ?  sadly to say :  nothing new or original here .  some aren't even fine tuned .  and baking is all about fine tuning .  worse ,  almost all the formula's can be found in other bread books .  and ,  most insulting for a buyer of this book ,  a lot of the mere 47 formulas  ( reinhart uses this expensive word because 'recipe' propably doesn't fit into the marketing of this baking book )  in this book are rehashed or directly derived from reinharts former book 'crust and crumb' .  clever marketing and ba-da-bing !  by the way ,  'crust and crumb' has been reedited in 2006 .  at a fair price ,  i admit .  so if you want your dose of reinhart at a right price without the pomp ,  sc�nes of a marriage ,  without peter reinharts comment on the eiffel tower so to speak .  .  .  buy 'crust and crumb' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves .  but before i buy i would also first flip through beranbaums and hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the amazon shop .  as for this book ,  you should ask yourself :  'do i want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book ? ' .taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews ,  as a baking book for the world market ,  this book is almost worthless .  the universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight .  like it or not ,  but that's a fact .  you weigh your ingredients carefully by grams ,  kilo's etc .  reinhart visited french top bakers poilane and gosselin ,  clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking .  i don't think that poilane measures in cups and ounces !  but even then ,  let reinhart measure in cups for the home market .  but then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula's itself for the rest of the world .  this guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic european inspired bread like ciabatta ,  fougasse .  .  .  about a worldwide bread revolution !  and then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads :  the same language ,  the metric weight system .  rose beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups/ounces .  it's a simple as that .  bread is a world food ,  so use the world standard for baking .  if not ,  market your book mainly to the usa market and be honest and upfront about that .  and don't give us that inflated hot air babble about a worldwide bread revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard ,  the metric wieght system !  this big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the usa .  the worldwide bread revolution won't be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide !next point :  reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast .  every baker worth his salt  ( or yeast )  will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste ,  volume and texture .  yeast is a living organism .  as 'instant yeast' it has been dried and put on the shelves for god knows how long .  it's like you force a just woken up coma-patient ,  that has been dormant for months ,  years .  .  .  to run a marathon .  fresh ,  pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant'  ( aka dried )  yeast .  try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home ,  and judge for yourself .  to place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments !  for scientific back up ,  you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist herve this 'molecular gastronomy ,  exploring the science of flavor'  ( columbia university press 2006 )  .and it gets worse .  reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads .  if poilane hears this ,  he'll drop dead !  every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening .  shortening produces a rancid/metallic taste and a slimy ,  unpleasant mouthfeel .  not to talk about health .  most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat .  read harvard's nutrition professor walter willets book :  'eat ,  drink and be healthy'  ( free press 2001 )  .  new york has already picked this info up .  professional food writer and teacher reinhart hasn't or doesn't care .  for instance ,  reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil .  in italian bread !  come on ,  let's be serious .  and this guy teaches at the culinary institute of america !  it's like he is advocating spam to put on the bbq instead of beef !  if that is the standard of baking that reinhart uses ,  he'll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a poilane .then there is reinharts hygi�ne problem .  there is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the hazzard analysis of critical control points  ( haccp )  .  reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the haccp by heart .  the first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns ,  is that before even touching ingredients ,  he must remove all the rings on his fingers .  because the place underneath a wedding band for instance ,  is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast .  and kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on ,  is not only very dangerous for the health of customers ,  it is simply not done for a baker .  i like my bread without filth baked in ,  thank you very much !  in the school where i earned my diplome in baking ,  if a student had a ring on during practical class ,  he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam .  yet we see professional teacher and bread book author reinhart kneading dough with his wedding band on !  see p .  36-37 ,  82-83 ,  255 ,  245 .  .  .  unforgivable in a 'professional' baking book .  and all the more in an expensive book that won the james beard and iacp awards !  has anyone of the juries of the james beard foundation and the iacp ,  any basic knowledge of food hygiene ?  has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygi�ne in a so called 'professional bread book' ?  one other thing ,  for a bread book that pretends to be world class ,  there is no word about gluten-free bread .  not one formula .  and this while more and more people are allergic to gluten  ( protein in wheat flour )  .to end on a positive note ,  one thing i found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book ,  was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread .  but ,  fellow reviewers ,  you can find all this info and more ,  and explained more clearly ,  more detailed and to the point ,  in hamelmans 'bread' and beranbaums 'bread bible' .  and it doesn't take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper .  peter ,  take out all the white empty space ,  learn to write more clearly and to the point ,  and you can say the same thing in 20 pages .  which leaves you 35 pages for more formula's for example .  but if you haven't any formula's left or are preparing a new book ,  then ,  yes ,  by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20 .  why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult ,  impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego ?so despite all the hoopla ,  hyped reviews ,  near hysterical praise and important awards ,  this is simply a too expensive ,  show off-book .  it's like the tale of 'the king with no clothes on' .  somebody has to yell :  'hey ,  wait a minute ! 'if you want good books on bread baking :  buy one by jeff hamelman ,  rose beranbaum and bernard clayton .  you don't get a model on the cover ,  but the content is all the better .  and in a bread book ,  isn't content more important than packaging
sorry for the sarcastic title .  i've read most of this book .  i'm still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter .i'll start with what i liked .  harris lays out some good suggestions on handling the pyhsical aspects of a dating relationship  ( or courtship if you get caught up in semantics )however ,  harris offers nothing else except a rudimentary courtship model that involves physical boundaries and guarding against things moving too quickly .i think this is good wisdom ,  but the book completely lacks in many other apects of pursuing a relationship .  he talks very little about communication skills .  also you won't find much on personality traits or compatibility .when i began a relationship with my girlfriend i read this book .  i don't regret reading it ,  but it lacks in a lot of areas .  part of this is due to the fact that i don't know what credentials joshua harris has to make his claims .  he is not a phd ,  or a relationship or family counselor .  he had two substantial romantic relationships in his life .  one with the girl who inspired him to write his first book ,  and the other with his current wife .  when it comes to relationships ,  i would hardly call joshua harris and authority on the subject .  he has no more experience or wisdom that the average person who would pick his book up off the shelf .i support the crux of what harris talks about .  i respect the fact that him and his wife shannon waited to their wedding day for their first kiss .  the book is chivalrous and romantic .  it is a hopeful book .but it paints only a partial picture of how to persue a relationship .  if you are into reading relationship books ,  just be sure this isn't your only resource .
ehrman's work is not for a person of faith .  it does not take faith into consideration .  it is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available - most forged and falsified ;  and none which can be validated .  i read it as an immediate follow-up to his work  " lost scriptures "  - books that did not make it into the new testament .  i was warned by my minister who is also a bible scholar and has two ph . d . 's - and my minister was correct .  in lost christianities ,  ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the new testament by implying that many new testament books may be false ,  forged ,  translated incorrectly ,  altered to serve a purpose ,  etc .  .  .  ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the new testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the new testament .  ehrman's lost christianities starts out strong ,  but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader .  if for nothing else ,  it is an attempt to test your faith ,  but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith .  the book leads one to believe that the author is as much a bible critic as he claims to be a scholar .  he does present all sides of the new testament story and it is interesting how the new testament was formed .  however ,  the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does .  to save you the time and money ,  simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the new testament and how came to be .  ehrman and other bible critics  ( ie .  ,  the devinci code )  seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the new testament story .  save your money and give it to your church instead .gary
i admit i was impressed by the table of contents of this book ,  and i admit i had no previous experience with the subject ,  but sure with the 'real life' of support services for a database company .  most of the book is devoted to review commercial software available on the market and for me ,  this is just enough to be dissapointed .  there are better commercial magazines or even websites can provide you this information for free .  .  .  although some formulas and templates looks very interesting  ( that's why 2 stars )  ,  maybe should you consider a help desk book instead
the book is interesting ,  and well written .  it contains little unique or scarcely known or understood information .  novice runners might like it and get more from it than experienced runners .
before purchasing made in detroit i read the reader reviews .   the reviews were so mixed that i decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead .   as it turns out i made the best decision .   all i can say is `thank you fellow reviewers' ;  this book was definitely not worth the purchase price .   my statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills ,  he is a skilled writer .   it has everything to do with his lack of insight .   that paul clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary .   i read the book ,  waiting for paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them .   but after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one .   blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make paul's life hard .   women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice .   he finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book .if you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings .   if you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage .   as i read this book i felt sadness ,  a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed .    ( there are white folks who actually still think like this .  )   my hope is that the light comes on for paul ,  he is still young .   if it does maybe he will share his insights with us .
american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree .  i read the human stain a few years ago ,  and it was good .   but ,  in pastoral ,  the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst ,  and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst ,  but absent the psychoanalyst :  roth is our psychoanalyst .  what he misses ,  however ,  is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control .  the swede never failed as a father ;  rather ,  he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her
this is not very good .  that is to say ,  the writing and the fluidity of gazzara's life become bland and uninteresting quite fast .i initially picked it up because as an actor i find biographies or autobio's about somewhat lesser known people more curious than approaching someone like paul newman or brando ,  who each have several books .  .  . and gazzara's career has been an intruiging one .  as a member of the actors studio ,  which produced the aforementioned actors along with countless others ,  his rise to broadway and hollywood was quick .  he originated brick in cat on a hot tin roof ,  and played his first film for otto preminger-opposite james stewart and george c .  scott ,  among others-in anatomy of a murder .but his approach to acting ,  which is of primary importance to me ,  was not chronicled .  instead he regales with stories of what and who the people he worked with were like .  what the particular country he was shooting in was like ,  etc .  ,  etc .one of his primary sources of regard is his work with john cassavetes ,  and it is clear cassavetes was a major influence and close friend ,  someone gazzara owes much ,  and the process by which they created husbands and other films is investigated more than any other .  cassavetes too comes out as a more interesting ,  larger than life guy ,  while gazzara's tales of living in italy ,  or being in spain ,  new york ,  hollywood ,  the philippines ,  etc .  ,  etc .  just made me jealous .  .  .i guess i wanted to know more about the life of an actor who has worked as long as gazzara has ,  is still relatively known-but never became a  " star ,  "  and continues to work ,  without feeling he is a hack who doesn't take his work seriously .  .
i've always been a big believer in  " attack the message "   ( if you don't agree )  ,  don't attack the messenger .   the reverse has been almost standard practice of the left when they can't refute the truth ,  facts and common sense of conservatives .   which is close to 100% of the time .so i have to be very careful not to copy the left when i write as a fifth generation kansan and having lived all of my life ,  thus far ,  in the same  " upper-middle class "  suburb mr .  frank seems to so despise in his first and only book .    but his book was so filled with errors ,  personal opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events ,  people and general culture ,  as to make it a book of fiction ;  not one of fact .he stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them .   he relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he wasn't born into a poor family of migrant laborers .   perhaps born as ms .  condoleezza rice ?   she is certainly a good example of someone held down by evil conservatives and not permitted to excel in life  ( not )  .   living in ,  and exposed to ,  the surroundings of his childhood ,  it appears to me his life's goal was to become a professional victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth .    he's ,  so far ,  at least succeeding in that !    being an accomplished loser .    what a goal !his only  " accomplishment "  was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of the dailykos .having written his fictional book of what life is not like in johnson county ,  kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of life's losing lottery ,  he really has nothing else to say .    perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the left writing the same type of fiction over and over  ( as he just did for the ny times )  .   he must be a very unhappy person .   it seems most liberals are .   how sad .   the only real obstacle they have in life is seen in their mirror each morning .   that's it no matter how much they deny reality .he seems like an intelligent young man who had everything going for him .   what a waste of talent .    now ,  he's just another  " victim "  doing his best to convince everyone else they too should just give up as they can't win in life no matter how hard they try .   as i intimated ,  i'm sure glad condoleezza rice ignored people like him !   i just wish people like him were fewer in number and that more ignored their delusional vision of reality .checking in from kansas ,  he is a  " one book wonder "  .
i read exactly half the book and stopped .   based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending ,  that was a good decision .   as it is there went hours of my life i won't get back !   the book is silly and laughable .   the premise sounded great - but the book is bad .   really bad
i appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there--but this book has way too much .   i read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men .i am going to stick to books that have more balance or emphasize hot sex between men and women .   the other stuff just doesn't do it for me .   i got bored and started turning the pages fast .   disappointing
this seemed too long and too drawn out
like the other posters ,  i too was given this book as part of our homestudy for adopting a child from china .  after reading the first chapter i found myself insulted .  this book assumes all who read it are adopting because they cannot get pregnant ,  which is not my case .  while infertility is something that should not be ignored ,  and i appreciate the fact that most adoption books i read address the matter ,  this book would have been much more respectable if it did not direct its text to the reader as a person who cannot conceive .  i was so insulted that i returned the book to my social worker with these concerns
this is one of the few books so bad that i couldn't finish it .   there is no explanation of how things work , or in many cases what they really are .   i feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed ,  sex ,  or guilt about greed and sex .   do not bother with this book
i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts ,  but i didn't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust .  almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments .  as i was flipping through the book ,  i found x-rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book .  i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore ,  and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back
i'll preface this by saying i'm a cryer .   i cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining .   i cried all the way through superman returns .   i did not ,  however ,  shed one tear during message in a bottle .in english class ,  i always learned to  " show ,  not tell "  when writing .   when that is your rule of thumb ,  you'll write a moving piece of literature ,  even if you're not completely skillful .   sparks is the master of telling without showing .i'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets .   the story is somewhat engaging ,  but with no payoff .   but the work is filled with passages like  ( and these are from memory ;  if i picked up the book to look for verbatim examples i'd have to type the entire thing )  ,   " he went to the refrigerator ,  opened the door ,  and took a beer .   after opening it ,  he sat down on the back deck .  "   or ,   " though she was overweight ,  she moved quickly around the table .  "    " she got out of the shower ,  dried off ,  and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt .  "   have you read enough yet ?i'm new to the romance genre .   my mother-in-law recommended sparks because -- i think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic .   they were to me ,  but then ,  i'm new to romance ,  and spoiled by the masterful ,  unequaled storytelling skill of stephen king .please hold your new york times bestsellers to a higher standard .   let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music ,  movies ,  and literature
normally i don't take the time to write a review ,  but this book just bugged me .   when i finished i felt like i had run a marathon .   the book was just too drawn out and i felt the descriptions were long winded .   faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem .   the plot was good ,  but moved slowly .   i am typically not drawn to danielle steel books and probably with good reason that i never seem to like them very much .   i am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that i paid $15 for at a used book store .   i would have felt like i wasted my money had i actually paid full price for it
on the one hand ,  i loved the book ,  since i am a big fan of thomas paine .  however ,  my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of  " the age of reason "  .  when they get the printing and/or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books ,  they should remove this review .  at that point ,  i will eagerly buy a new copy
the story was slow ,  predictable and boring .  i am still amazed i hung in there and finished reading it .   it's a dud in my opinion
my grandmother and my mother have read danielle steele for years ,  but i must admit i'd never picked one up .  i was always more for historical romances .  but i wanted something different ,  had heard good things about her ,  so while at the library ,  decided to give her a try .  i have to say i'm extremely disappointed .  granted ,  i'm a fellow writer  ( a very picky reader by nature )  ,  and an unpublished one to boot ,  but the writing could've been better in my opinion .  the first five pages are all backstory of paris's marriage  ( no action ,  no excitement ,  told very  " history lesson-ish "  )  and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between paris and her husband  ( the inciting incident in the first chapter )  left me wondering ,   " so what ?  "  .  twenty five pages in ,  i could care less about these people .  i honestly expected more from a bestselling author .
[ joshua 6 : 23 , 21 ] joshua said to the people of israel ,   " the lord has given you the city of the all silver ,  and gold ,  and vessels of brass and iron ,  are consecrated unto the lord :  they shall come into the treasury of the lord .the people utterly destroyed all that was in the city ,  both man and woman , young and old ,  and ox and sheep ,  and ass ,  with the edge of the sword .deuteronomy 17 : 3-5  " and he should go and worship other gods and bow down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens ,   .  .  .  .  . and you must stone such one with stones and such one must die .  "romans 1 : 20-32  .  .  .  . 32 .   " although they know god's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death ,  they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them .  "numbers 31 :  and the lord said unto moses ,   " avenge the children of the mid'-an'ites .  .  they warred against the mid'-i-an'ites ,  as the lord commanded moses ,  and they slay all the males .  and they took all women as captives ,  and their little ones ,  and took the spoil of all their cattle ,  and all their flocks ,  and all their goods .  and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt ,  and all their goodly castles ,  with fire .  moses said ,   " have you saved all the women alive ?  now kill every male among the little ones ,  and kill every woman that has known a man by lying with him ,  but all the young girls who have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves .  "[ quran-60 : 8-9 ]  god does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not fight you because of religion ,  and do not evict you from your homes .  you may befriend them and be equitable towards them .  god loves the equitable .  god enjoins you only from befriending those who fight you because of religion ,  evict you from your homes ,  and band together with others to banish you .  you shall not befriend them .  those who befriend them are the transgressors .
i agree with the reader ( s )  who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown-together ,  as if no one proofread it .   in one chapter she'll recommend something ;  then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous !   she gives a long ,  long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments ,  recommendations or opinions of her own .   personally i think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff ,  but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work ,  i might consider trying them .  on the whole ,  this book is a waste of money
this book is mostly hype .  the writing is not that great .  japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work .  however the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way .  if you are a serious reader skip this book .
i remember reading  " the chamber "  distinctly .  somehow ,  this book doesnt even near that standard .  the story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns .  the characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out
lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach  , used by billy beane and the oakland athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of  , primarily ,  on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers .this approach generated a number of divisional championships for oakland in the weakest american league division , but no pennants and world championships . there are omitted variables and misspecification  problems in the sabermetrics ( statistics )  approach of bill james used by beane . first , james's system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts . all outs are not equal . hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base . hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error . strikeouts are thus the worst type of out . this omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1  to 1 . 25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over , say , 100 for a regular , everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the season . the second problem is that the james system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays , especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball outs . another category is needed-walks that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts and/or walks where the runner is able to steal second base . these walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out 150+ times a year and hits  . 250 but has a  . 375 obp .james's system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors
the message meant more to me than to my young children .   they didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box .   they think playing in cardboard boxes is fun ,  not a punishment for exercising too much freedom .   i could see using the book as a basis for discussion ,  but i think it may just scare children that they too could be locked up by their parents
if an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery ,  you'd think they'd have a lo say about it ,  right ?  well ,  ford certainly expends plenty of words ,  but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories .  mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament ,  the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white ,  middle-aged ,  married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity .  story after story plods cautiously along ,  poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way ,  with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness .  adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male .  marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons ,  and yet ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it .  i have no idea what his personal background or situation is ,  but it's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something .  if he wasn't such a literary bigshot ,  there's no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over ,  and isn't provocative ,  insightful ,  or even interesting .  ps .  if you were planning on the audio version ,  don't .  ford is a terrible reader ,  sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment
i'm an avid reader of history ,  as well as processing a degree in the subject .   so imagine my surprise when ,  after receiving this book from a friend of mine for christmas ,  i read the erroneous account of the children's crusade of 1212 .   i had done research on this topic ,  so i was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred .   had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years ?   if he had ,  he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly french people led by stephen of cloyes who ,  when told to turn back by king philip ii ,  did so .   that ended that crusade .   the other one ,  led by a shepherd from germany named nicholas ,  led a group across the alps into italy .   some left for home while others continued on to rome .   it's interesting to note that in rome ,  many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these  " children "  were either too old or because they were pregnant .   perhaps until relatively recently ,  people believed in the children's crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles  ( like chronica albrici monachi trium fontium )  which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred ,  rather than relying on more contemporary sources .   nor did they realize that the latin word  " pueri "  used in the chronicles can have several meanings  ( such as unmarried men rather than  children )  .in the final analysis ,  you just can't rely on books like these to really teach you history .   the best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it .   if only the author had bothered to check the history channel's own account of the children's crusade on their website ,  or perhaps read the excellent paper done by peter raedts in the journal of medieval history ,  or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia .   the book gave two pages to this event ,  and sadly got it completely wrong .for this gross oversight ,  i am compelled to give it one star .   readers of history ,  never just believe what you read - verify
amazingly tedious for a thriller .   reacher is a good character ,  believable in his expertise ,  but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence .  the book takes too long to tell everything  ( and i mean everything )  - it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought reacher has  ( many repeated over and over )  .  i hope child fixed these flaws in later books .
if tony hillerman wrote this novel  ( novella actually )  ,  i sure can't tell .  i have been a chee/leaphorn fan for many years ,  but this novel is not in the same league with hillerman's other work .  it is reminiscent of a 'b' movie .  instead of building suspense ,  the plot is laid out all too plainly ,  the characters are unreal ,  and the chee/bernie romance doesn't ring true .   i am amazed that it was published
i am a huge clyde edgerton fan ,  and i'm sorry to say i was very disappointed with this book .   it just never seemed to get off the ground .   i was expecting the type of story that i fell in love with in *raney* and *walking across egypt*  ( both of which left me in tears ,  i laughed so hard )  .  if you're looking for listre ,  you're not going to find it in this book  oh well ,  i guess i'll wait on his next one .  .
by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might .  and while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion ,   ( i . e .  swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century )  pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of christian virtue .  this is basically saying christians have lost a culture war without explaining why .while the initial exposition on what the parameters of christian modesty mean pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of christian modesty would be .  furthermore ,  when push comes to shove he refers to the westminster larger catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused .  some of his cases are self-defeating .  on one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century .   props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting .on the other hand ,  it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much
in the post 9/11 world in which this book ,  subtitled  " the clash between islam and modernity in the middle east "  was published ,  it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day .  this ,  however ,  is not to be found in what went wrong ?instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae .  we learn ,  for instance ,  that ,   " a distinguishing characteristic of western music is polyphony ,  by harmony or counterpoint .  this begins in its simplest form with the choir ,  in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect ;  then comes the keyboard instrument ,  matching the ten fingers of the two hands ,  following different routes in a common purpose ;  and finally ,  the musical ensemble ,  from duets and trios to the full orchestra "  .  while this is all well and good ,  and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level ,  it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of  " the clash between islam and modernity .  .  .  "  that has led to the precarious times in which we live .or ,  on another note  ( harmony ?  counterpoint ?  )  we learn that robinson crusoe was translated into arabic by butrus al-bustani and published in the late 1850's .  big deal !what we don't learn anything about is the rise of militant islamism .  there is no mention of wahhabism or how this fundamentalist islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity .  the muslim brotherhood also is not to be found in the index ,  nor is there a mention of sayyid qutb ,  or his writing of the incendiary manifesto ,  milestones .  furthermore ,  there is not a single reference to al-qaeda ,  though usama bin laden does appear ,  albeit seemingly as an afterthought ,  in what appears to be a hastily added afterword .so what went wrong ?beats me .  .
great book ,  of course ,  but for this edition oxford used a computer to justify the  type .  on every other line you encounter three or four spaces   where there should be  only one .  it may not bother most readers ,  but i'm looking for another    publisher's edition
in a world desperate for health solutions ,  the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have  not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity .   alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters .careful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant oriental women ,  it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born .   hence the seven ( 7 )  percent utilization of this water in that part of the world .elsewhere ,  mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the japanese organizations which promote alkaline water .common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake ,  then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral ph liquid is the answer .alkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood ph with  high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put  you in the emergency room as my medic ( 1985 nobel prize recipient )  clearly points out .you might as well drink battery acid he said ,  the result will be the same stress on your blood ph .   here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood ph .he continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system ,  the very low ph which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly .   the various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers .the alkaline promoters ,  including this book's author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with  even the very basics of body chemistry and metabolic processes .read the book for entertainment and not for education and utility in your daily nutritional program
this books seems interesting until you learn  ( within a few pages )  that the author forbids masturbation at any time and basically sees sex as a crude animal instinct .if you're a big bill bennett fan you might enjoy this ,  but for those inerested in developing a little more restraint while still participating to some small degree in modernity ,  look elsewhere .   btw ,  mr .  o'reilly ,  the world is not a more brutish place than ever before .   sad ,  to say ,  it's almost certainly less so .
.  .  . are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better .  of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market .  in particular ,  if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative .  but the fact is ,  mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know .  so instead mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on wall street .but i am glad i read this book .  having seen mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago i developed a strong prejudice against him .  but reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified .  he can never just state a fact .  instead he always has a to phrase it as  " my work shows that .  .  .  "  or  " i demonstrated that .  .  .  "  even if he makes the same claim again and again .  if he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so .  he even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the levy distribution as the mandelbrot-levy distribution .  the most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the brooks-metelsky-mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'everest' of this set and received fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit .  disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians .one time i criticised mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad .  but in this book mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system .  astonishing !i think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless .  but i found the discussion of multifractal time methods  ( which make up a large part of the book )  to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless .  i work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time ,  but it doesn't mean i have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces .  it just means i know how to fool the eye
should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a  " business decision "  ?  i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this  " criminal spectacle "  designed to make the question of martha/mdiddy's innocence a moot point .  are honest business practices being pushed to the side ?  by normalizing ,  generalizing ,  and minimalizing martha/mdiddy's crimes ,  are we loosing our morality ?  how important is integrity to a leader .  .  . former ceo of a company ?be  " thoughtful
a writer for the irish echo said this book should have been titled  " the protocols of the elders of erin .  "   it was written around the time al smith was running for president and appealed to the nativist ,  anti-catholic prejudices of upstate new york and america at that time .   while there really were gangs in that era ,  most of new york's immigrants were busy building hospitals and schools like st .  vincent's ,  fordham ,  st .  john's ,  manhattan and manhattanville .   the vast majority of the city's population including its immigrants didn't riot in 1863 .   in fact new york city's 200 , 000 soldiers and sailors ,  more than half of whom were immigrants ,  won over 100+ medals of honor during america's civil war .it's a tribute to the persistence of prejudice that this book isn't more widely recognized as the nasty practical joke that it is
as a romantic comedy ,  star wars is a failure .   as a science fiction film ,  the annie hall is a complete disappointment .   whatever other merits these movies might have ,  there are definitely areas that they are lacking .   which brings me to the rough guide to cult movies :   as a reference book ,  it is highly suspect .   what's notable is that annie hall fails as sci-fi because it doesn't try to be that genre ;  the rough guide fails at the very category it aspires to .   which is too bad ,  because it is often an interesting read .the failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so broad as to be meaningless .   we then a series of chapters representing various  " genres "  ,  some of which are valid  ( science fiction ,  westerns ,  horror )  ,  some of which are ridiculous  ( animals ,  food ,  nuns )  and some of which are not even true genres  ( dubbed ,  independent ,  straight-to-video )  .   after this ,  we get various miscellaneous topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason ,  such as a list of top movie grosses followed by presidential movie trivia .the movie descriptions are often amusing ,  although there are numerous errors  ( such as misstating geoffrey rush's role in pirates of the caribbean )  ,  even more omissions  ( every reader will find his own ;  one example is that unforgiven is missing from westerns )  and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a specific genre to fill it out .what saves this book is ,  even though it fails as a reference book ,  it is nonetheless entertaining .   i am therefore giving this two stars instead of one .   it's a rather useless book ,  especially if you want to learn more about movies ,  but if you do pick it up ,  it is probably the most entertaining two-star book that you're ever likely to read .
i received a book that i didn't even order .   the one i ordered is yellow and white  (  3th edition )  .   this isn't the one i ordered ;  therefore ,  i need a refund . i sent the book back and i know the seller received it on 8/19
i am by no means an economist ,  and much less an expert on finance ,  but this book strikes me as a thinly veiled ,  unsubtle hatchet job on the efficient markets hypothesis .   i've seen much subtler discussions of the efficient market hypothesis written for general audiences ,  enough of them so i can recognize that lowenstein doesn't get it ;  he equates efficient markets with  " the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value ,  "  and not with  " you can't reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do .  "   this is a crucial difference ,  because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water .the other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story ,  given what his sources are .   reading between the lines ,  i just have to wonder if his description of the personality and character of the people he describes as the core folks at ltcm is much too informed by interviews with people who've had a falling out with them
the book had so much promise ,  but i find it to be disappointing in several ways ,  alas .   the recipes i've tried have been delicious ,  and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative ,  although the discussions and instructions don't rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool ,  as would ,  for example ,  anything by julia child ,  marcella hazan ,  jacques pepin ,  or any of the king arthur flour baking cookbooks ,  all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes .   in this case ,  i was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before i bought the book .   were i a tyro ,  i don't think this book would be the best introduction ,  although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying .my biggest disappointment ,  though ,  is the organization of the book :   ice cream recipes are  " bundled "  with their accompanying cookies ,  garnishes ,  and the like ;  instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream ,  for example ,  we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches ,  with ice cream of any of several different flavor families .   one has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find ,  say ,  recipes for chocolate ice cream .   i would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes ,  by flavor and page number ,  right up front -- i don't want to spend so much time looking for the flavor i want .my next disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically attractive and most stylish but virtually illegible size and color .   my middle-aged eyes struggle desperately to read the book ,  even with my reading glasses on ,  and i surely can't prop the book 18-20 "  back from my utensils ,  to read as i work without changing position ,  as i like to do with my cookbooks .   this is a case in which the author and editorial team seemed to have chosen  ( admittedly very attractive )  style over function .   the book is very attractive ,  and the photographs are lovely -- but i would gladly sacrifice some beauty in favor of being able to read the recipes and discussions more easily .my final disappointment is in the complexity and elaborateness of most of the  " dessert packages ,  "  for lack of a better word .   making the ice cream or sorbet and its accoutrements is ,  in most cases ,  a tremendously labor-intensive exercise .   i have opted for using some of the creative and delicious ice cream recipes and figuring out my own much simpler and easier garnishes and accompaniments .   i work a demanding job and have a house to run .   i love to cook ,  but can't devote as much time to making an ice cream sandwich ,  for example ,  as these recipes require .   so i use less of the book than i'd wish .over all ,  ms .  luchetti's sense of style and taste are impressive ,  and she seems superbly knowledgeable about frozen desserts .   and many of the ice cream recipes are lovely .   but i had hoped that this would be a book i would pull from the shelf much more often than i will ,  in fact ,  because the book is so difficult to use
hmm ,  quite a disappointment ,  especially after splurging on the hardcover edition .   set as a kind of  " rockies rear window ,  "  this is one slow story .   endless pages of crazy-making when i'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through .   finally skipped ahead to finish the book .   i had really looked forward to angels fall ,  too  :  (   if you are a roberts fan ,  don't spend the money on the hardcover ,  wait for the paperback ,  go to the library ,  or borrow from a friend .   not worth the price .
this book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually no understanding of computer systems by the author .  i don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving ,  but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes ,  firewalls and hacking techniques ,  those details must be fairly correct .  in this case ,  the technical details were so wildly implausible that i finally had to stop reading .  the part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access nsa data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details .  the nsa almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet  ( through any combination of firewalls )  but if they did ,  they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked .besides all that that ,  the characters were cliched and not well developed .this is all too bad ,  because the plot was interesting and i would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide
the  " bottom-line "  on  " brainless "  is that one has to be  " brainless "  to take time to read coulter's writings ,  and even more brainless to waste the time to read an analysis of them .yes ,  it is mildly interesting to learn of coulter contradictions  ( eg .  bashes the elite ,  then takes on harriet miers - partly because she didn't go to an elite law school ,  and  " i believe everything i say ,  "  vs .   " most of what i say ,  i say to amuse myself and amuse my friends .  "   and then there are the infinite number of brainless  " coulterisms "  and unsupported assertions - eg .   " public schools have more sex scandals per year than catholic priests - thirty times more ,  "   " liberals lie about the science on stem-cell research because they warm to the idea of destroying human embryos ,  "   " i've never seen people enjoying their  ( 9/11 )  husbands' deaths so much .  "   on the other hand ,  maguire really doesn't have that much to say that is interesting !on the other hand ,  if you hadn't figured out already that there is someting seriously wrong with ann coulter - this book won't help .   save your money and your time
this is ,  without question ,  the worst book ever written on one's financial life .   to begin with ,  it's useless :  zero information ,  zero new analysis of old information ,  zero advice ,  zero interesting anecdotes .   additionally ,  it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data ,  to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering .   what exactly is this guy's point ?    no way to tell .seriously ,  this book is so bad that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have ,  in my opinion ,  lost all remaining credibility .what a waste of my $16 and 4 hours .i want my money and time back .
j . k .  rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book .   the characters personalities were wavering in book 5 ,  in this they completely vanished or mutated .   i'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and i've read this far so i might as well go the whole way .in books one through four the trio of harry ,  ron ,  and hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day .   book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving ,  and more whining than day saving .  book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done .this book harry seemed to care more about romance .   a very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction ;  which had no background or build up from previous books .   a female character from the background ,  whom harry barely even notices all through the past five books ,  is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion .   several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to rowlings amature attempts at romance ,  none of which bore any revelance to plot or story .harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence .   the clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another .   the image of harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying ,  frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose ,  under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with malfoy .as to the general plot of the book .   poorly done .   continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me .   most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information ,  and the culmination of what harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything .my final opinion :  don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization .   a very disappointing book
gail's writing is again wonderful in this in book ,  but i found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure .  i felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be .  i almost felt as if the writer wasn't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic ,  yet hopeful story .  i can only compare this book to the samurai's garden since i haven't read a third book by this author yet ,  and i loved the samari's garden !  so i was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end .  i am not sorry that i read this book due to the fact that i enjoy the author's style of writing
why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book ?   honestly ,  what has this author contributed to the world with this book ?   was it the characters ?   no ,  they've all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years  ( i . e .  cocky and handsome fbi agent ,  beautiful but dangerous killer with a past ,  take-no-sh#t fbi boss ,  etc .  )  .   was it the deep insight into the characters themselves ?   a laugh out loud ,   " no !  "  .   there was nothing coming close to character development .   was there some new and clever writing style ?   unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary  ( i call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel )  .   how about the plot ?   was that something worth my time ?   not unless you haven't ever watched suspence movie in your life .so honestly ,  what the hell makes this book worth anyone's time ?   all i can find in this book are two dimensional characters ,  needless sub-plots ,  ludicris dialogue ,  and empty promises  ( we're lied to about the main character's fate in the beginning and we're lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of hitchcock )  .as a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape hollywood's onslaught of needless ,  pointless ,  and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage i can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money .this man does not deserve our money and certainly does not deserve to write anything other than an apology letter to the world for dumbing us down into thinking that this type of writing is anything other than trash
i'm usually a sucker for just about any kooky theories backed up by barely-there evidence .  even trying very hard to be generous  ( hey ,  i'm a christian and i think it would be fabulous if the stuff in this book were true )  ,  i think i could poke a hole in every page .  and that's after perhaps 12 months of formal mandarin study and a similar amount of cantonese .don't buy it .  it's embarrassing to christians that this sort of thing gets passed around as scholarship .  if they'd wrapped it up with a plot around it ,  it'd make a great work of fiction
i wavered awhile between three stars and two stars ,  because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as sony and akio morita seem to deserve at least three .  however ,  in the end ,  the book's errors just piled too high .  it opens well ,  with the story of sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after world war ii ,  to becoming one of the world's great companies .  this is a fascinating and inspiring story ,  and morita tells it with flair .then ,  unfortunately ,  the downward spiral begins .  morita consistently takes his experience at sony and assumes that every other japanese company operates the same way ,  which is a fantastically wrong assertion  ( as the last thirteen years of japan's seemingly endless recession have shown )  .  he also frequently takes good basic management techniques ,  like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway ,  and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely  " japanese "  .then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false ,  such as japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology .   ( it actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world ,  as the kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated .  )   or how japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything .   ( yet it only recently discovered the concept of  " second-hand goods "  ,  instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away .  plus ,  japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging .  )reading between the lines ,  a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that japan faces today .  for example ,  morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the united states .  while this can ,  of course ,  sometimes be a serious problem ,  it also gives u . s .  consumers a way to protect themselves .  japan's consumers ,  on the other hand ,  without an accessible court system ,  are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives .  complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored ,  because they lack any threat of legal action .  in another example ,  morita praises the  " trust "  and agreements without contracts that exist among japanese corporations .  in reality ,  this  " trust "  is a death pact ,  as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies ,  instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs .other than the glimpses into sony's history and corporate culture ,  this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of  " japan is going to take over "  books that came out in the eighties .  although ,  of course ,  considering all the  " internet companies are going to take over "  books that came out in the nineties ,  not even this is a uniquely  " japanese "  phenomenon .ps :  anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of japan should read  " dogs and demons "  by alex kerr .
even with the questionable veracity ,  i enjoyed frey's first book ,  a million little pieces ,  since it stayed true to an addict's experience .   leonard ,  on the other hand ,  came off as pure fantasy ,  with very little substance .   even the description of frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable .   it was not even interesting as fiction .
" just enough "  is more than enough :   a turgid ,  pretentious ,  strident ,  and wholly unoriginal piece of work .   its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior ,  nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature .  at best ,  this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the harvard business review ,  but surely not enough material for 280 pages !   better to read &quot ; do what you love ,  the money will follow  :  discovering your right livelihood , &quot ;  by marsha sinetar ,  and call it a day
a much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story .   the end was a disappointment and the middle laborious
my understanding is that this book is an accessible summary of the ideas catsells presents in his three volume magnum opus ,  the information age  ( which starts with the network society )  .  if this is so ,  i am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy .  this is a really bad piece of sociology ,  characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis .  why did i give it two stars instead of one then ?  well ,  it does have some ok parts .  catsell's analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism .  he also presents some convincing data  ( gathered by other people )  that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on-line world ,  alienating them from the world of face-to-face interaction ;  this happens in the case of a few troubled people ,  but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off-line relationships .  the rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image ,  with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology .  this is ,  frankly ,  ludicrous reductionism .  it doesn't even stand up to a simple test of chronology--a lot of the developments that castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid-1990s .  as castells himself admits ,  businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene ,  and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements .  on top of this ,  castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked ,  whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations .  i'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena .  castells does see some of the problems with the new network society--loss of job security and the digital divide ,  for instance--but he tends to downplay these .  and his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same--more internet access ,  more network social organization .  talk about a narrow vision
i was there ,  as were several of my fellow sitka fire department emt's and state troopers from the sitka academy .   the 6 of us ,  along with two parajumpers from the canadian armed services were flown through the typhoon winds ,  on a helicopter ,  out to the williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers - literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed .   we knew there was a doctor onboard ,  from anchorage ,  but we literally never met or saw him - i'm sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up - but that is where he stayed .   the real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend .   but i was disappointed to see that mr .  jeffers failed to fully research this book - the role the sitka rescue teams played  ( both on the williamsburgh and trying to assess/fight the fire on the prinsendam )  was totally overlooked - despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story - which was the human side & had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event .   i was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out ,  was very sad .   at least we all have our commendations from both the coast guard commendant and the canadian armed services - they knew we were there !    too bad mr .  jeffers didn't due diligence .
i first read passages from this book in college .   i can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds .   professor zinn is a far left author .   he uses the usual lines :  america generally bad ,  communism generally good .   obviously mr .  zinn has the right to write whatever he wants ,  and his writing style is very convincing .   however ,  if the reader investigates the facts ,  many holes become visible in his theories .   those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints .   a good example is  " intellectual morons  :  how ideology makes smart people fall for stupid ideas by daniel j .  flynn "  which gives the reader a good profile of mr .  zinn .
.  .  . you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library .if you want to get an  " inside view "  of the inner workings of wall street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s ,  then read den of theives - that book is well written and well worth the money !what turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style .   the first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of serendipity .   he was simply in the right place at the right time ,  had virutally no idea how he got there ,  felt out of place the whole time  ( even when he was raking in the big bucks in ny and london )  ,  and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it .   i also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at salomon brothers .   he was there ,  he made a lot of money ,  good for him - get over it !i was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has a lot more potential .   i might have actually enjoyed it - had i not read den of theives 7 years earlier ,  and already had some idea of how things took place .   but ,  if you can get it for $5 or less  ( including shipping )  ,  and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like  ( and you haven't also seen the movie wall street  ( which covers the same highlights in this book )  )  ,  then it's probably worth it .i did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book ,  relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up .  .  . althought that seemed a little rushed .  .
this is by far one of the least helpful parenting books i have read .   i used numerous suggestions in this book and none of them proved to be effective .   using my own judgment and keeping calm with a positive attitude toward my toddler proved to be more effective then anything mentioned here .   his suggestions for head banging are completely stupid and made my toddler bang her head harder during a tantrum .   not recommended
i had to read this book for an intro to geology course ,  and although i find geology to be fascinating ,  i had a very difficult time following this book .   the author uses a lot of technical vocabulary and is rather repetitious .   although i understood what mcphee was talking about most of the time ,  i think it would have made a better film documentary than a book .   the author constantly went off on tangents and the overal organization of the book did not appeal to me at all .   .   . it would be more readable if written as a field journal because i could not even figure out when one day turned into another .   but the book did a decent job of presenting the bigger picture
.  .  . and dump it .  .  . great advice given in a previous review .i think the  " shame "  about this book is that it glosses over some very interesting ideas with  ( in my opinion )  some wholly unsupported and mostly un-related crap .talbot is to the theory of the holographic universe what mark furman was to the guilt of oj simpson .   whatever truth there is to it will be hidden by his presentation of  " false evidence "
when professor polk describes the sweep of history in iraq ,  he is at his best ,  but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts .   much of the political ranting is supposition ,  marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work .  the ranting gets especially tedious towards the end .   my advice ,  read the first part and skip the last half
that so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me .  luckily ,  i bought this book used ,  otherwise i might be kicking myself for paying full price .  between her utterly uninspired  " devotional dances "  to things such as sex ,  wisdom ,  and the  " sticky one "   ( a term she made up for the astral body )  ,  and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to  " anoint "  it ,  i was unimpressed ,  to say the least .  however ,  driving on a trip a friend and i got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book .  it's very ,  very amusing if you don't take it seriously .  the thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth .  there's nothing evolutionary about it ,  unless you consider being a wanton ,  idiotic freak  " evolutionary "  .  if this is what humanity is evolving into ,  i am frightend
jesus ,  talk about the little girl crying  " wolf .  "  when i picked up this book ,  i expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with .  what i got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption .the book starts out promisingly ,  even if preston surrenders freely to flowery prose .  we're given the account of charles monet ,  one of the first documented cases of the ebola virus .  from there on ,  preston gives a description of the virus ,  what it does ,  how it does it - the works .  then ,  he moves on to the human component ,  the cast of characters ,  so to speak ,  for the big story .the big story is ,  alas ,  not so impressive .  it's a case of an ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about ,  but nothing of the sort happens .  basically ,  people run around in bio-hazard gear ,  fret a lot ,  and monkeys die .  in between ,  preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the ebola virus ,  cases of people being infected ,   " crashing and bleeding out ,  "  cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys ,  unless you're a peta type .the worst thing about the hot zone is just how self-indulgent preston is .  he starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book ,  which is a noble idea ,  but not when they don't die at the end .  basically ,  he's trying to make you care about these people ,  and all for naught .  and by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned ,  you actually want them to die ,  because you're tired of hearing about him describe ,  in active detail ,  what they eat in the morning ,  what they do in the afternoon ,  and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night .  when you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a level 4 virus ,  why are you spending time talking about nancy jaax's hands and karate prowess ?  moreover ,  when you've finally gotten to the monkeys ,  why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild ?  does anyone really care ?i wish i could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis ,  but i can't .  preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary ;  he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions ,  but he instead chose to  " get into the minds "  of his subjects .  and what a bore that became .  there were only two redeeming aspects of this book :  one was the description of the african ,  human ebola victims ,  and the other was the description of the virus itself ,  although ,  again ,  both were sabotaged by preston's inability to write .if you want to know something about ebola ,  go get an idiot's guide to dangerous diseases and epidemics .  if you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the human element ,  read the hot zone .  personally ,  i like to avoid rereading the uncle tom's cabins of scientific accounting
i don't get the impression from reading the book that the authors have even tried to analyzed the financial holdings that was set up .  it is the thinnest book on enron that i read ,  for very good reason .
john katzenbach is an accomplished author and i had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels  ( the analyst )  ,  so i was surprised at how bad the shadow man was .   the premise of the plot is that four very old jewish people ,  survivors of the holecaust ,  believe they have seen the  " shadow man "  .   the shadow man was a jew who joined forces with the nazis to find jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps .   these four old people feared the shadow man more than anything .   when one of them is killed ,  a retired police detective named simon winter looks into who the shadow man is .   meanwhile ,  the miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect .eventually ,  winter and the police and the district attourney join to hunt the shadow man ,  a man of pure evil .   as the book villian ,  it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s .   also ,  this book barely touches on wwii ,  yet purports at times to be a novel about wwii .   i've read a lot of great wwii novels ,  and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s .   but setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasn't too exciting .   it wasn't exciting primarily because i wondered where had the shadow man been all these years ?   why was he starting to kill now ?   the shadow man had no motivation to kill .finally ,  i realized i didn't like this book when i was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages .   the entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story .   if you take away the wwii angle ,  this novel is bad .   the wwii angle adds some excitement ,  but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of wwii better than this one does .the review from publishers weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated .  .  .  " katzenbach  ( just cause )  has some good holocaust and wwii vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here ,  but the book is burdened by flat characterization ,  a slow pace ,  an odd ,  unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing .
there isn't anything in this book that you won't find in warren buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway  ( available for free at the berkshire hathaway website )  .   if you've not read those letters then i suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out mr buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read ,  humorous and homely style .this book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment  " buffett like "  .if you're not familiar with warren buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to buffett .   anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here .
elizabeth george ,  please come back .   this book examines in sickening detail the events preceding the murder of our lovely helen .   i ,  for one ,  don't care .   i get it .   we all got it the last time .   it's been a long time since i have abandoned any book after a few chapters ,  and this book truly deserves to be put down in every sense .   don't buy it
i am soooo tired of danielle steel's books .  they have lost all of the originality with which she used to write .  every book now has the same story line just different names for the characters .  boring !   what happened to the good stuff - thurston house ,  ghost ,  kaliedescope  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .i had stopped reading her books because i have been sick of the same old thing - i borrowed miracle from a friend hoping it would indeed be a miracle and would be original danielle steel -i was completely wrong .  i would guess her writing is suffering because she pumps out 2 to 3 books a year .  danielle if you are reading this  ( and i hope she is )  please give us back something great to read - quality instead of quantity !   until then i won't be buying or borrowing any more of her books .
i found this book to be full of silly metaphors  ( as if that's the only way we could relate to  dr .  twerski )  .   it just didn't get me the information i needed .   perhaps others would find it motivational
i like john grisham ,  but the king of torts was a slow-moving disappointment .   grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel ,  which is fine ,  but he ends up putting the message above the story .grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits .   this provides grisham with an excuse to explain ,  in agonizing detail ,  how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees .   grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers ,  and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients .in the end ,  none of this adds up to an engaging storyline .   it doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that grisham is obviously setting up for a fall .   since i didn't care for this character ,  i found the storyline of the king of torts to be largely uninvolving .this novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone .    i personally dislike class action lawsuits ,  but i read novels for entertainment ,  not to validate my own political beliefs .    although this book was decently written ,  i just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend .for a better version of this story ,  i would suggest a civil action by jonathan harr .
much repetition and too little of artists neither western nor white .  .  . or male for that matter .  though the sections are a lovely idea the same art is used in each .  a not terribly risky venture ,  this
i found this book very boring .  tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but i kept waiting for something to happen .  poor maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a properamerican .  i will read another of her books since she is so well thought of
another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation .  .  .  if you dig that sort of thing .  .  .  there are tons out on the market .  .  . unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers .  like one would get when reading a book on the occult .  .  .  people tend to go for books that support their bigoted view ,  and this is a fine example .  .  .  it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it .  .  .  .  it is a living .  when the da vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code ,  how to interpret the code etc etc .  .  .  .  i am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof .  .  .  people write for years even for the ny times before others discover their plagiarism .  .  .  .  or in this case the secret agenda .  .  .  .  before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad .  .  .
this book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille .   very weak and ordinary .g
several reviews of this book ,  published elsewhere ,  stressthe contents of rossi's analysis were more focused towardthe skeptical side of egyptian math and construction methods .rossi ,  therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing new information within unproven paradigms .on the math side ,  rossi mentions fibonacci's algorithmand phi ,  two paradigms that clearly were not used in ancientegypt ,  though many like to suggest that they were .  thefibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and j . j .sylvester's skeptical views of the rmp's 2/nth table ,  arereference point to 1202 ad and the liber abaci ,  but nota reference point of egypt .  egypt used more subtle ideaslike http : //egyptianmath . blogspot . com and http : //akhmimwoodentablet . blogspot . com  .yet ,  hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that ahmes in 1650 bceasily wrote out 2/p series into short and concise unitfraction series using a very simple partitioning method( as ahmes wrote out n/p answers in his 'false position'algebra problems ,  ie .  5/19 written out in a long awkwardseries using 1/12th as the first partition ,  as he did for 2/19 ,as describe a couple paragraphs below .  ahmes wrote 5/19per ,  5/19 - 1/12 =  ( 60 - 19 ) / ( 12*19 )  =  ( 38 + 2 + 1 ) / ( 12*19 )or ,  5/19 = 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/114 + 1/228 )  .clearly modern scholars  ( two being robins-shute )  have often suggested that 'false supposition' was used by ahmes ,  hintingthat ahmes guessed at his answers .  ahmes never guessed !  ahmes'answers were always exact when he worked with rational numbers .moderm scholars were the ones that had guessed ,  and missed ,  finding ahmes deeper methods .  interestingly no scholar ,  untilvery recently ,  has claimed to have read ahmes' shorthandnotes .  modern scholars had sadly filled inlogical gaps leftby ahmes with their own intellectual guesses - many of whichhave been proven to be wrong  ( as rossi had not learned ,  sincehe referenced none of the controversial eguptian fraction and weights and measures issues )  .bruins also discovered the hultsch method in 1945 ,  and todaythe method is named the hultsch-bruin method .  it says that2/p = 1/a  +  ( 2a -p ) /apwhere a ,  a highly divisible number selected in the rangep/2 &lt ;  a &lt ;  pwith the divisors of a uniquely added to  ( 2a -p )thereby solving  ( 2a-p ) /ap .example ,2/19 = 1/12 +  ( 24 -19 ) / ( 12*19 )= 1/12 +  ( 3 + 2 ) / ( 12*19 )= 1/12 + 1/76 + 1/114with the  ( 4 + 1 )  alternative being discardedsince its last denominator was too large .rossi also mentions that egyptian division may have followedan inverse operation of its multiplication 'doubling' method .here also rossi did not seen the simple remainder arithmeticfound in rmp #62 where 100/13 = 7 + 9/13 = 7 + 2/3 + 1/39 .generally ahmes and all scribes divided by this q = quotientand r = remainder method .  the akhmim wooden tablet evenshows a special method for grain and volume division wherea hekat unity 64/64 was divided by n ,  with n &lt ;  64 ,  as( 64/64 ) /n = q/64 + r/ ( n*64 )even more interesting ,  ahmes also used this method todivide 100 hekat by 70 ,  with his final form matchingthe akhmim wooden tablet's special use of ro = 1/320thof a hekat ,  by :( 6400/64 ) /70 = 91/64 + 30/ ( 70*64 )and introducing ro = 1/320 of a hekat ,=  ( 1 +16 + 8+ 2 + 1 ) /64 =  ( 150/70 ) * 1/320= 1+ 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32+ 1/64 +  ( 2 + 1/7 ) *roi'll not go on and discuss rossi' view of egyptianarchitecture being the above her standard cambridgeskeptical comments .overall ,  many accept rossi's view as informative ,and i do as well ,  in limited areas .  however ,  on themath side of rossi's quick use of a sylvester's andother recent skeptical techniques ,  all disproven years ago ,shows that her cambridge training needs to be expandedto read the egyptian mathematical texts .  clearly ahmesand his brother/sister scribes are the only expertsthat should guide our understanding of egyptian math .
i held great hopes for this book--duveen has long been of interest to me because of the pivotal role he played in the creation of some of the greatest art collections in this country .   however ,  secrest in her drive to capture the  " essence "  of the man has so mangled the story of his life and career that reading her work is more chore than delight .   to say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement .   but worse than that are the inaccuracies ,  especially when she writes about duveen's customers .   just for starters ,  apparently she didn't recognize the need to differentiate between john d .  rockefeller ,  jr .  and his father  ( or maybe she didn't know there has been more than one jdr !  )  .   you won't learn much from this tome that you don't know to begin ,  and getting through it will be a struggle .
lies ,  half truths ,  spin and glitz .   of course there is some truth sprinkled in .   self promoting tv stars are more interested in being self promoting tv stars than truth .  theres just not enough time for both .  at best it's entertainment ,  at worst it misleads the children .   and finally they are all biblically illiterate .   so be careful .  .  . especially with tbn .
becoming a master manager ,  the textbook currently used in my introduction to management class ,  does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management .   the book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager ,  and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role .   while i appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject ,  i do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow .   the reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency ,  and while meant well ,  they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper .   furthermore ,  becoming a master manager stresses models and theories of management that i find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management ,  which are not adequately presented in the textbook .   some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth ,  but in a more advanced level of business management .   and while becoming a master manager is the official textbook for my management class ,  i have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information ,  and only the eve of a test do i bother to look over becoming a master manager ,  i do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all
just finished reading this novel this morning and i think it is probably the weakest one of the lot .   like a lot of reviewers ,  i didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the stephanie plum series .   as well ,  the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between stephanie ,  joe and ranger is approaching its use-by date .   it is definitely becoming boring and i think ms evanovich needs to resolve stephanie's romantic situation once and for all .   i still enjoy characters like lula and grandma mazur but a lot of the situations stephanie found herself in fell flat with me .   there are only so many times she can have her car blown up ,  handbag destroyed ,  apartment broken into ,  etc ,  before it becomes tiresome and repetitive .   i still think there is a spark of life in the stephanie plum series ,  but i hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one
don't buy this book ,  no substance only good for sale
i'm a huge suz fan  .  .  .  but i really think she missed the boat on this one .   her style has changed since she moved to hardcover & this book just fell flat for me .   the secondary storyline or fbi agent jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple cosmo & jane .   didn't like her at all & cosmo lost his  " seal-ness "  somewhere along the way .   not a re-read for me
why is s douglas  " scotty "  slamming every car sales book on amazon but zig zigler's ?  do you work for ziggy or maybe a friend and pushing this book for him .  take a look at all of s .  douglas  " scotty "  reviews concerning car sales .  he puts almost everyone of them down but praises zigler's book .  what's up with that ?and then if you look at reviews from hardluck it makes one wonder if he is selling a competitor's book on here because he is attacking books written by douglas hensley who is a really good writer .  it makes me wonder if  ( s .  douglas scotty and hardluck )  are the same person or are possibly in cohoots together pushing people away from pretty good books .  something stinks here .  i wish i had time to play on the web all day and put bogus reviews on people .  something stinks in denmark !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !
a friend going through the same problems as i am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me ,  as well .   i was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions .   if i could actually use the information to help myself ,  all the better .   i was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through ,  so i struggled through it ,  expecting it to get easier to read .   it didn't .   it's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and i'm really sorry because i'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting ,  but i just can't get past that page 104 .   i normally refuse to leave a book half unread ,  but this just has to be an exception because every time i pick it up i fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages .i agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings .   i feel like i'm watching a video of it ,  as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail .   but i wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group ,  not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had .   also ,  i felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail ,  i ended up having to skim over some sections .this may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background ,  but too much for a regular joe like me
i'll put my opinion first ,  so there won't be any doubt in your mind .   i don't believe that you can write useful books about national character .   is there really such a thing as &quot ; national character&quot ;  ?  people are  just too different ,  too unpredictable .  how well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you  ?   how well can you predict what  people in your own country will do  ?   would every italian ,  if they could  write well ,  have written the same book as mr .  barzini  ?   i seriously doubt  it .   so what we have in the italians is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million italians .   after reading it ,  i felt even more strongly  that such books ,  though possibly entertaining ,  are a waste of time .   an  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist  ?    anthropologists have  been concerned ,  for many years ,  in getting the &quot ; inside view&quot ; --the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it .   while barzini is  indisputable italian ,  he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign  visitors ,  then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there ,  why  they are as visitors see them ,  or why they are not as foreigners may think .    this is not a successful gambit .   cultures are based on many general  factors--like history ,  socio-economic patterns ,  religion ,  family ,   etc . ---but the specific results are just that ,  specific .   barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality ;  the family vs .  the  state ;  italian modes of achieving success ;  the north-south split ;  sicily  and the mafia ;  and last ,  the tragedy of italy's long domination by  foreigners .   but nothing really connects .   there are only superficial ,   scattered impressions ,  nothing very concrete to grasp .   the reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes .   barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history .    these sections were well-written and interesting .   but his portrayal of  italian &quot ; character&quot ;  is fuzzy ,  contradictory ,  and ultimately ,   unconvincing .   finally ,  if you are a lover of lists ,  you will thrill to  this book ,  because there is a list on nearly every single page .   myself ,  i  got pretty tired of those lists .   if you want to know something useful  about italy ,  read another book .   if you just want entertainment ,  which  might support any stereotypes you have about italians ,  then this book could  be for you
" the last river - the tragic race for shangri-la "  .  .  .  .  .  .  . tragic .  yes i'd agree that this book is tragic .tragic that i bothered reading it .  .  .  .  . tragic that i paid for it in order to read it .  .  .  .  . tragic that todd wasted his time writing it .  .  .  .  .  . tragic that i disliked it so much that i can be bothered writing a review .the warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket .   " advance praise for the last river "  it reads .  in retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it .it seems that todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be ,  and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal .  so much of the content has so little relevancy to the story ,  that you soon tire trawling through it .this was my third tsango experience .  i do recommend the outside documentary on the lindgren expedition .   " hell or high water "  is not outstanding ,  but is worth a read ,  but on this book ,  my advise to todd is please make this the last river that you drag through the wringer
hands down this is bukowski's single worst book .   bought it when it first came out just before/after his death in 1994 .   having read just about everything the man had written ,   " pulp "  was a hugely disappointing epitaph .   if you've never read bukowski start with  " post office "  or the short story collections ,  but avoid this like the plague .   a bad book .   i can't think of a single reason to recommend it
" karl marx ,  years ago ,  gave a description of why this might be happening .  he followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value :  an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make .  "no it's not !  !  !  an object's worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers .  to imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make ,  which would mean that we should subsidize the military-industrial complex ,  since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things ." petty-bourgeois' owners ,  i . e .  the mom-and-pop stores and small business in general ,  of which my grandpa ,  a dentist ,  was a part of ,  are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail .  "this is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government .  all regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out .  there's a reason why the owner's of wal-mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $8 ,  as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt ,  lay off employees ,  and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with wal-mart .  another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to wal-mart  ( wal-mart collects millions in subsidies due to marx's labor theory of value once again )  and of the use of emminent domain abuse  ( which can be justified on the grounds of the  " greater good "  as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores )  ." but no theory is ever flawless ,  and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and  " reality .  "  there is no reason to believe that heavy social hierarchy and class division is a necessary evil ;  workers can manage their lives just fine through cooperatives .  "sure there is .  human beings are inherently unequal ,  differing in many skills ,  abilities ,  ambition ,  the choices that they make in life ,  how they apply their time ,  etc .  etc .  of course ,  there is isn't any reason that individuals can't create wealth nonetheless ,  creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some good or service itself .  and cooperatives need to be voluntary first .  nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth .   there needs to be some division of labor ,  trade and commerce ,  etc .  or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the real law of the jungle to survive .   this can't happen if everything is collectively owned ." since workers are the sole producers of goods from scratch to end "no !  entreprenuers ,  innovators ,  etc .  provide much of the creativity ,  design ,  direction for the purchase and use of capital goods ,  negotiation of deals ,  evaluation of threats ,  problems ,  and consumer requests ,  and other such things .  it wasn't the workers at microsoft who created cheap desktop computers ,  it was bill gates ,  the workers are merely a form of mass-production who help out ,  but ultimately mass produce a good or service in exchange for privately owned wages ,  caused by supply and demand .
i enjoy food but most of the recipes in this book are things i wouldn't eat in the first place
i own and have read all of ja jance's jp beaumont and joanna brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives .   i picked this book up ,  thinking it would be on par with all the ja jance books i've read previously .   what a crashing disappointment .   i can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told ,  i kept looking at the cover to see if i'd picked up a harlequin by mistake .   i'll probably read more ali reynolds books if this is indeed a new series ,  but i'd much rather see what happens with jp and joanna - incidentally ,  i didn't think much of either of them ,  either ,  when their paths crossed some books ago .   this one gets a big  " aw ,  c'mon ,  ja ,  you can do much better than this !  "  from me .   for those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first jaj ,  get the jp beaumonts and start at the beginning .   they are worth the time and effort
for someone totally unfamiliar with authorware ,  i thought this book rather confusing .  i typically learn best by playing with software and using the manual to construct my own exercises .  however ,  i knew authorware was pretty complex so i thought this book would help .  well ,  it did help a little but overall i became quite frustrated with following the book's exercises .  as i use authorware i imagine i'll keep this book on my desk as a reference tool .  but until then ,  i'll content myself with playing on my own
while this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature ,  i do have some critical comments to make .firstly ,  it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences  ( or more specifically ,  those of his family )  have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented .secondly ,  there is a lot of content to trawl through to get ,  in my opinion ,  a few pieces of interesting material .finally ,  the underlying theme or accusation that without ibm the holocaust may not have happened ,  or would not have been so sever ,  is  ( again in my opinion )  flawed .  as the book shows ,  ibm certainly made it much easier for the nazis to locate and identify jews ,  it would not have been impossible without ibm .having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading
i really love amanda quick ,  but this one just didn't work .  we don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together ;  the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other .  very disappointing from a romance novel .and i don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels ,  but the plot in this one defies belief .  it's never explained why the first murder even occurs .  the hero's fear that the murderer will focus on venetia because she's using the last name  " jones "  is beyond ludicrous .  if that was going to be a major plot point ,  at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together .  but jones ?  !all would be forgiven if the romance were compelling ,  but it wasn't in the slightest .  i will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library
like others ,  i picked this book up after reading several in the no .  1 ladies .  .  . series .   no comparison .the story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book .   i just don't understand the rest of this book .   isabel never even asked the key question to the whole  " mystery "  until it slapped her in her silly face .   the mystery for me is - what is the sunday philosophy club ,  and what in the world does it have to do with this book ?i'm sorry i spent the time on this - there are important books to be read
just bought a rotisserie and was hoping to find how to use it and good recipes .  only found about 4 or 5 .  i would've liken to know different types of meat you could cook in it and for how long you cook it for
mr .  friedman's book begins with an interesting thesis ,  defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth .   the idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that friedman often well supports with historical facts .   however ,  the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis ,  or if he just felt the need to write a book .   furthermore ,  for every chapter in the book ,  there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that ,  with a little thorough thought or research ,  don't make sense or can easily be disproven .   with these things being the case ,  i find friedman's argument a little hard to buy .   the entire book seems to build up to the final chapter ,  which friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth ;  this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely ,  however ,  because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book  ( ie .  the importance of education )  do not add or support his final policy recommendations .   his policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question  " what should the government do to promote economic growth ?  "   they don't push the argument forward or indicate anything that hasn't already been suggested in the past ,  nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies .
fans of the abc-tv show  " lost "  will probably be buying  " our mutual friend "  in droves after having seen desmond keeping it to be the  " last book  [ i ]  ever  [ read ]  "  .   since i did not have to buy it ,  having purchased a full set of dickens years ago ,  i immediately set out to read it .what a disappointment it was !   dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period .   one cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is ,  just a bit ,  perhaps ,  'padded' .   any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages .dickens' work is melodrama ,  but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art .   as oscar wilde said of 'the old curiosity shop' ,   " i simply cannot read of the death of little nell without laughing .  "   'omf' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence .even worse is the ending .   some endings just can't help but feel contrived ;  and dickens ,  having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions ,  pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated .all of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for  " the complete oxford illustrated dickens "  but i assure you that my only concern is for you ,  gentle reader .   unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of dickens' oeuvre or are required to read  " our mutual friend "  ,  i would ,  instead ,  direct you to dickens' far superior works :   'david copperfield' ,  'oliver twist' ,  'pickwick papers' .if you are looking for 'lost' reading material ,  i would refer you to 'watership down'  ( excellent )  ,  'the stand'  ( by stephen king ,  entertainment ,  not literature )  ,  'the dark tower' series  ( by stephen king ,  entertainment ,  not literature ,  and similar to 'our mutual friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending )  or a review of philosophy like 'locke ,  rousseau and hume' .namaste and good luck ,aka redemption isle on thefuselage . co
i'm at page 116 right now .   the writing is lovely ,  the specifics dense ,  and the sense of place rich .   if the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say ,   " i just can't go on with this story !  "  i'm going to throw the book at the wall .   also ,  so many embarrassing little holes .   if i were a librarian i would say ,   " so dracula's checked out .   go to a bookstore .   every bookstore in the country has a copy .  "   and if i were the cat ,  i would know i was a goner the second i appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph ( you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it )  .   lastly ,  it seems like dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them .   unless  " dracula "  is related to our heroine--that would be good .   will read a bit more .   .   .
$24 . 95 is way too expensive for a book that is only 100 pages .   other than that the content in the book is good
there are plenty of excellent play therapy books out there ,  this is not one of them .   maybe it's just me ,  but a play therapy book should be way more user friendly .   i need quick access ,  color and .  .  .  art

i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book ,  the killer angels .   it is not fair to compare the two ,  but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one ,  i thought i should mention it .   this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book .   it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg ,  so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle .   but the result is a less satisfying book .   it skims rather than digs deep

this book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms ,  bubbles ,  and busts .prechter should have left it at that .   instead ,  he offers up predictions .   big mistake .   this guy bases his forecasts on fibonacci numbers and so-called elliott  " wave counts .  "    he labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained elliott wave 5-up ,  3-down pattern .   if you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move ,  you just don't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market .   he's imposing his theory on the market ,  but surprisingly enough ,  the market doesn't care .   it does whatever it wants ,  in however many waves it wants ,  and bob has been very frustrated at the market's aberrant behavior lately .   he got lucky early in his career ,  but it seems he's been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the '87 crash .any superstitution can  " seem "  to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures .   keep looking for certain numbers of waves and fibonacci ratios and you'll find what you're looking for .   pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts ,  and you'll find those too .   the market doesn't care about any of those things ,  though .   it's nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices ,  which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully .   university studies of various investing methods have found that elliott wave ,  like most ,  is no better than random stock selection .if prechter had chosen the random method ,  he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market .   unfortunately ,  he has been getting everything from the dow ,  to oil  ( he thought it was going to $10 )  ,  to gold  ( he didn't think it could break $400 )  ,  to deflation  ( the  " deflation "  scare ended shortly after this book came out )  wrong in the past couple of years .   he apparently still believes that the dow will go to 400  ( not 4 , 000 but four hundred )  because his charts tell him it should  ( they've been telling him that since about 1990 ,  actually )  .   prechter doesn't understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system ,  all of which render  " dow 400 "  among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population  ( i don't think prechter is counting on that )  .our debt-heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon ,  perhaps by the end of the decade .   it will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates .   but it's not happening now and it's not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade .this book came out near the bottom of the 2000-2002 stock bear market ,  just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market .   how typical .   while promoting the book ,  prechter said it was  " definite "  that stocks would  " crash "in 2003 .   he said that 2003 would be  " the best year yet "  for bears  ( short sellers )  .   late into 2003 ,  when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong ,  prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004 ,  the dow would  " certainly "  fall below 5 , 000 .   wrong again !   since his fibonacci turn dates and elliott wave counts fail to portend the future ,  maybe next he'll tell us he's found the secret code to the stock market from the text count of nostradamus' writings .bob prechter couldn't call the market if it was listed in the yellow pages .   this guy couldn't time the market if you gave him a stopwatch .   he's throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as  " definite "  and  " certain .  "   he's either a liar or a true believer in his own irrational superstitions .   in either case ,  he's not credible .here's all you really need to know :  buy dividend stocks .   buy short-term bonds .   buy gold .   hang on to them .   do that and you'll do better than you will trying to follow the prognostications of market gurus .   plus ,  you'll have a lot more time to devote to family ,  fun ,  and productive activities
keynes was no doubt an influential economist .   his theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-new deal economic policies of the united states and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like imf .   however ,  his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the u . s .  particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation  ( an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to keynesism .  )   we have keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government .   read planning for freedom or socialism by ludwig von mises instead
this book is not what i thought i bought .   i was expecting information useful to left handers .   instead i found out why society belives left-handers are evil and research on how left handers are formed .   i  enjoyed reading the encylopedia more than this book .   by the way ,  it was  written by a right-handed person
when i traveled in japan with a friend ,  this was the book we brought with us .   within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in tokyo looking for a better one .   there are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country ,  and the advice to get a jr pass was invaluable .however ,  the book has a very negative ,  immature view of japan as a country and travel in general .   it seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade .   did i pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with americans ?   the authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites ,  ancient and modern ,  that borders on the anti-intellectual .   the cultural notes are dated ,  inaccurate ,  and shallow .   after a while ,  we began to think ,   " if lonely planet doesn't recommend it ,  it's probably interesting .  "   the maps ,  as many have mentioned ,  are almost useless .   ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path ,  it's practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas .there are much better guides available .   this entry has sworn me off the lp series for life .
i have to preface this by saying that i absolutely love eating at the candle .  so delicious .before we moved from nyc ,  i thought we have to get this book .  we've tried several of the recipies ,  following them to the letter ,  and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the  hummus .   i think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies ,  because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless ,  or tasted like salt .  don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions ,  because they all end up runny and bland .  so sad
i was looking for a book with practical advice on how to handle real-life situations .   i felt most of the book talked about how to parent ,  i . e .  cosleeping ,  wearing baby ,  etc ,  but did not give advice on how to handle a specific situation .   what do i do when my child runs away from me toward the street and then hits and bites me when i pick him up ?   i don't want to spank ,  but a 24-month old just doesn't take to  " a talk "  or timeout like dr .  sears says he should .   the sears birth book was amazing ,  i recommend it to anyone ,  but this book did not help me answer my questions
of the 7 or so grisham novels ive read this one is my least favorite .it's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long ,  about 150 pages longer than it needed to be .it also just lacked credibility in many spots .  grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible ,  if not really interesting .  most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that ive always thought were fascinating .  this book ,  however ,  plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work .the other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for mark sway ,  the 11year old protagonist .  he sounds more like a street-wise 30year old ,  using words like  " wonderful "  and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's .  i think grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters .this isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable
i think the linda howard who wrote white lies ,  sarah's child ,  duncan's bride ,  mackenzies mountain ,  diamond bay , etc .  is one of the most talented current romance writers .unfortunately ,  when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the  " big time "  ,  her writing started to decline .  she is clearly in over her head now .   what a shame she couldn't stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers .this just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it .  this is pure  " peter principle "  in action .too bad
the photos are beautiful ,  the designs are just wonderful .  .  . but if you have kids this is not real life .  this is a magazine lifestyle .  you could only do this if you had an unlimited budget ,  there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets .  sure my home could be organized if i had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins ,  and all the baskets i could buy !  stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table .
miniter takes advantage of the american ideological divide by cashing in with controversal editorials of hyperbole .    maybe he could get together for a book with ann coulter
i found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what i was looking for .   the small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful
these are revised remarks since my comments about  " prediabetes "  and  " stop diabetes "  being the same book .   i got them both and felt somewhat duped .gretchen did contact me to explain the prediabetes is a second edition of stop diabetes .   i wish it said that on the cover .the book ( s )  info about stopping the progression of diabetes is great ,  so i do recommend either of these books .   it is well written in a style that's easy to understand .   just don't get both books ;  they're essentially identical
the book is entertaining ,  however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent any time studying the ancient world to any degree .  .  . you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events ,  biblical texts ,  and blatantly stretched  ( pun so intended )  the truth on so much .   i'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong ,  but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol .   if you take away any claim of being a historical reference ,  this book is good .   it's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does .   totally not serious ,  but a giggle to be had here and there .   some of which is at the author's expense
i am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here .   simply put ,  this is the single worst novel i have ever read .   everything about it--the writing ,  the characters ,  the story--is godawful .   here follows an absolutely true story .   while i was forcing myself to read this drivel ,  i went out on date .   she and i were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it .   i was advocating the 25 page litmus ,  and she insisted on at least fifty .   she did several long train commutes a week to and from work ,  and so read a lot of novels .   anyway ,  i started describing this book .   she recognized it immediately ,  and interrupted me saying ,  &quot ; the bear went over the mountain !   don't read another word !   if you think it's bad now ,  it only gets worse ,  if you can believe it ! &quot ;   she was right .   if you feel the need to find out for yourself ,  save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library
coming from a 16 year old girl that has to read this book for a school project .  .  . i would have to say that this book is kind of boring .  if your into physics and science and all that jazz then you will most likely enjoy this book .  but if you're going to read it just to read it ,  then i would suggest you not .  i have to admit ,  that some of the stuff richard feynman says is funny but i found my self skipping pages at a time because of its boringness .   don't get me wrong ,  i really do admire mr .  feynman as a man and he was a great physicist but this book was just ok .  sometimes he got into a lot of in-depth physics stuff that i just didn't care for .  but sometimes i was interested in what he was saying .have a nice da
ok ,  i can't deny it ,  this book was well written .  but what made me throw up is the age differance ,  i mean what the hell !  how can tana like someone who's 30 years older than her ?  that's aweful !  this is what i really hate  about dan's books ,  she hooks someone who's 20 with some1 who's 35 .  i don't  find that interesting .  all i can say about full circle is that it's good  but so depressing .  it made me cry (  which proves that danielle is a good  writer )  don't read this book if you are not ready to get depressed
to say christianity will die is to say that one can see the end of the world .  purely craziness .  christianity will live as long as the world exists .  what is died is the faith for many christians ,  what has been changed is our faith  ( by money ,  pride ,  and selfishness )  and consequently ,  our church and our societies .what dominants many us and european christian churches is a worldly christianity ,  a christianity affected by the materialism ,  and world-view .  the exact thing that jesus repeatedly condamned .i feel extremely sad when i can see pasters and evangelists earn 6-figure salaries ,  live in luxury houses ,  air-travel in business class ,  or socialize with social elite .  i feel extremely sad when i see young theology students without born-again experience and spiritual life become pasters and preasts .jesus have given us great mission :  to preach gospel to every corner in the world .  but money ,  pride ,  and selfishness have consumed the hearts and sole of many christians and today they love the world more than they love jesus .  are they still christians ?  of course not .to say christianity needs change is purely nonesense .  only person see himself greater than jesus would say something like that .  what needs to be changed is ourselves ,  not christianity .because we have embaked a wrong way ,  following the world and not following jesus .
i heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently  ( a middle-aged adult )  and i have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written ,  i . e .  ,  it was so shocking and disgusting !  such filth !  i mean ,  that's why i heard about the book when i was growing up .  but as so many others have already pointed out ,  it is tame by today's standards .  i also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the  " female protagonist is completely a male fantasy .  the book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part .  .  .  "  now ,  you see ,  what struck me about sir clifford's situation ,  and lady chatterley's ,  for that matter ,  is if they really loved each other ,  his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms ;  there are other things that can be done ,  yes ?  in fact ,  quite possibly connie would have had an orgasm for the first time !   ( ahem ,  women readers will know what i mean .  )  but clifford treated connie poorly .  with or without the lack of sex issue ,  i think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway .  which to me ,  just goes to show that a man wrote the book .  .  . a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick .
the official censes of the ottoman empire in the early 1900s showed well over five million christians living in the provinces of what are now modern turkey .   western specialists who helped the turks conduct their censes stated that the turks purposely undercounted the christians and overcounted the turks .   so ,  there were many more than just five million christians .   there are now approximately only a hundred thousand christians in modern turkey .   the question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today .   we know that over a million surviving greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between greece and turkey in 1923 .   again ,  what happened to the huge difference of 4-5 million people ?   to the 1 . 5 million massacred armenians ,  must be added three quarters to a million assyriac christians  ( aramaic-speaking arab christians )  and as many as two million greeks  ( almost 30 percent of the greek people )  .   the author does not touch on the large numbers of christians who were enslaved by turks or forced to convert to islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number greek-speaking  " turks "  around trebizon on the black sea .it is not as if there is not vast contemporary accounts of neutral and western observers of this enormous genocide and ethnic cleansing of the original ,  pre-turkish populations of anatolia .   i can only conclude that the author had such an inborn bias in favor of turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the jewish holocaust of wwii .   avoiding this subject amounts to holocaust denial .the christian genocide was the first great genocide of the 20th century and hitler's model for the jewish genocide .  the massacre of the greek and armenian population of smyrna  ( now izmir )  ranks with the rape of nanking in sheer horror and scale ,  but the author skips over it in a rush to avoid any detail of the crime or assign any blame except to the greeks and armenians by repeating the discredited canard that they set fire to their own city .the author's treatment of the christian genocide reminds me of the comments to me of a turkish officer at a nato conference which were to the effect that there had been no armenian genocide  ( the turkish government official line )  but ,  in any case ,  that they had deserved it .   the author seems to have taken her treatment of the subject from the turkish government as well
this is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced .  regardless of where you stand politically ,  johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree .  throughout this work johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities .
i'm a conan doyle fan and found the alienist to be a pretty good read ,  so i made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside .  carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it .  the dialogue is flat ,  the plot uncompelling and carr relies on the near-endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement !  !  !  into this tale ,  which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because i couldn't bear to read the mangled sentences .  this book has no climax -- just ,  thankfully ,  an ending .  spend your money on something worth reading .
clarke's glaring research error :  author of the prophet ,  kahlil gibran  ( 1883-1931 )  ,  in an article titled  " the new frontier "  wrote  " are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what can you do for your country ?  "  .  clarke sure missed this one ,  as have so many before him .  did kennedy just paraphrase ,  or did he plagarize ?  i would have liked to have seen clarke deal with this sticky issue .
when you have lost weight ,  it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off .  whenever they have heard me tell my story ,  read my blog or book ,  or found out that i did it on the low-carb lifestyle ,  one question invariably has come up from time to time :" what do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day ?  "my initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this :" that's absolutely crazy !  there's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method .  "i did the atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there .  but there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it .little did i know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about .  it's called the carbohydrate addict's diet and it was written by a husband/wife team drs .  richard and rachael heller .the cad diet ,  as it is referred to ,  makes the claim  ( and i agree with it )  that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance .  just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less ,  that same concept is what goes into the cad diet .if people think the atkins diet is restrictive ,  then check out what you have to do on the cad diet :breakfast :  zero-carb meal consisting of protein and fat .lunch :  zero-carb meal consisting of protein and fat .you are not allowed to eat any bread ,  fruit ,  milk ,  juice ,  and most starchy vegetables .  absolutely no snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda .  you cannot use artificial sweeteners either .sound appealing ,  anyone ?  hmmm ?  i suppose if that's all there was to this diet ,  then nobody would do it .  but there is one more key aspect of the cad diet that you probably will be interested in .dinner :  eat equal amounts of protein ,  vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount ,  but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame .  you can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your  " reward "  meal .how's that for incentive ?  you basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line !  who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do that ?  !well ,  i'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a daily basis .  i caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial  " planned splurge "  meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss .  however ,  the hellers give you a daily planned splurge !  !  !  what's up with that ?we can blame this on dr .  rachael ,  who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet .  she became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat  ( ostensibly to help herself in the process ,  too )  .  she had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then ,  like most of us would ,  ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper .  the next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds .thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale ,  she tried it again the next day ,  skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again ,  she lost another pound .  she played around with what would eventually become the carbohydrate addict's diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day .the frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the cad diet .  the hellers believe that anyone who consumes any amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether .  they say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict .  it will make them crave their poison even more !that's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the cad diet until the end of the day .  this process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one ,  and the hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people .i still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds .  sure ,  they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one big meal each day ,  but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- hunger !there's no way i could do the cad diet because i enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion .  i truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off .  since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the cad diet ,  it would literally drive me insane even if there was that  " reward "  meal at the end of the day !wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict ?  click here to take the 10-question carbohydrate addict's test .  i scored a 2 ,  which means  " you do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted .  "  no kidding ,  ya think ?dr .  jonny bowden ,  author of living the low-carb life ,  examined the cad diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works ." while it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese ,  it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin ,  as the hellers hypothesize--in fact ,  the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response .  "furthermore ,  dr .  bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program ,  stating  " it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate .  "while the carbohydrate addict's diet has worked for a lot of people and i always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off ,  i still have my reservations about this program .  i think i'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day
not that i don't like shakespeare's works ,  but his tragedies are terrible ,  especially this one .  i can't understand the language real well ,  so i have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand .  i just can't understand this love tragedy at all !  here are some things that confuse me :*how did this feud really begin ?*why can't this story end in happily ever after ?*why does lady capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody ?*why couldn't shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand ?*why does everybody have to jump to conclusions ?i simply can't understand why people love this play so much .  it's ridiculous !  if you want a true love story ,  try reading  " a midsummer night's dream "  .  this one absolutely sucks !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !
this is a classic circle jerk book that consolidates a number of articles from educators and educational researchers who talk about the same thing ,  and cite each other or similar data and research .   the authors do write well ,  so i gave it two stars .   but it has under/overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system - dump more money into schools ;  teachers are underpaid and overworked ;  high stakes standardized testing is bad .   folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of jay p .  greene's  " educational myths "  to run a little de-tox on the stuff they read here
sorry ,  but i found this book a total waste of time .  i never did like the main character - i found her boring !  i laughed out loud when i read another reviewer say that  " this person escaped her life to be a secretary ?  "  - good point !  it was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this  " new "  life without really taking time to search her soul .  instead she befriends even more boring people than herself . as far as the ending of the book goes - i couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway !  after reading it  ( book on tape )  i felt i had totally wasted my time .  what a disappointment
this book turned out to be a disappointing resource .   although the book includes 20 , 001 names ,  many are unlikely and outlandish  ( klotild ,  edwige ,  ghislain ,  ethelbert ,  birtle )  ,  making it arduous to sift through to find the  names more worthy of consideration
the premise of the store is interesting .   how did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football ?   the first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons .    ( west coast offense ,  lt ,  etc .  )unfortunately ,  at that point lewis runs out of things to write about ,  so he starts talking about michael oher ,  an o lineman at ole miss .   oher's story is intersting ,  but it is too early to tell .   he is a  " superstar "  but only a sophomore .   i also think that lewis overdoes how great oher already is .i also don't really understand what oher's story really had to do with the original premise of the book .   is lewis saying that because left tackles now make millions ,  oher wants to be one ?   i would think that if oher had come around in the 70s people would still have thought of him as a football player .   last time i checked lineman were big and strong  ( and quick )  in that era too .
this book shows how robert has been lying all along .  he talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless .  ok then ,  how did robert make the monthly payment ?  why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a porsch as a bum ?  this guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses .  he is a conman and a good one .  thats why hes a motivational speaker .  it takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money .  don't fall for this conman !  this book contradicts what robert has been preaching in previous books .  robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless .  that would be odd but it isn't odd because robert is a professional liar
i received this book as a gift .   i was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as bob novak and sean hannity .   haven't any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book ?   no .   and with good reason .   it's not a history book ,  it's a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk  " the faithful "  out of their hard-earned dollars .i did read several chapters of the book to be fair .   when crocker describes the papal forces during the albigensian crusade as  " soldiers of god ,  overcoming all the odds to destroy the wicked oppression challenging the authority of the church .  "   i wanted to puke .   and how about the inquisition ,  where church authorities sanctioned physical torture against  " heretics ?  "   well ,  crocker concedes that torturing someone might stray a little bit from christ's original message of tolerance .  .  .  but hey ,  they threatened the authority of the righteous catholic church ,  so they got what they deserved .   uh ,  yeah ,  amen brother .these considerations aside ,  the book isn't even well researched ,  which immediately destroys its credibility with me .   for example from the albigensian crusade ,  crocker states that the armies of the heretics numbered over 100 , 000 ,  yet with only a few thousand men ,  the pope was able to defeat them ,  as they were filled with the  " glory of god "  or something like that .   curiously ,  in his footnotes he cites nothing to back this claim up .   maybe because it isn't true .   and any cites to books that have been critical of church policy ,  like ,  say ,  endorsing mussolini ,  are derided as  " unresearched ,  "   " politically motivated "  and  " shameful "ironically ,  that's exactly what  " triumph "  is to me
the amazon description says vol .  1-3 ,  boxed set ,  hardcover .   that is all true .   what they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes .   the box in which it comes is clearly marked ,   " volumes 1-3  ( of six )  .  "   that would have been a much better description for amazon to have used .   if you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set ,  this book is for you .   if you are looking for the complete set ,  look elsewhere
it is difficult ,  nay ,  impossible ,  to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious ,  money worshipping parasites ,  and that is exactly what we have in this novel .out of the blue a godfather appears ,  a deus ex machina ,  who offers an idealistic lawyer ,  clay carter ,  more wealth than he can imagine or use .   anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait ,  a very sharp ,  very large hook .   with apparent ease ,  this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble .   enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him ,  he immediately loses sight of reality .   what a hollow and useless individual he is ,  as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world .whether or not there are such individuals  ( enron ?  )  is beside the point .   they may exist ,  but i for one am not eager to hear their life stories .the atmosphere in which they live is boring ,  as are their conversations ,  their lack of values ,  their hobbies ,  their sex lives ,  and their comeuppances .   somehow ,  even in their fall ,  they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are .having read most of mr .  grisham's other books ,  i expected better from him .
a sad reminder that history is written by the victors .  i wonder how americans would feel if al qaeda would write a similar book glorifying the 9-11 attacks .  disgusting
robert kiyosaki's books are all the same thing re-packaged over and over again .  this book could have been condensed into a couple of paragraphs and saved it's readers a lot of time .  he writes in an arrogant ,  condescending manner that is hard to stomach .  i would hate to have been his real dad .  it's obvious that he despises him and worships at the alter of  " rich dad .  "  it's offensive and disturbing .read the first review of this book and you'll have the essence of the whole thing .  don't give this guy any more money for putting out this drivel
this is the first book by shaara i have read .  and ,  if his other works are like this ,  it is also the last .on the cover ,  j .  persico is quoted as saying shaara makes  " literature read like history and history read like literature .  "   he goes on to claim that shaara brings the war to  " pulsating life .  "   i have even read a review that claimed this book was better than remarque's all quiet on the western front .i must have been reading a different book .   the first chapter ,  the replacement ,  is a great short story .   after reading it ,  i had hight expectations for the book .   unfortunately ,  it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view .   and ,  the history reads like an 8th grade textbook .his narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived .   they are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them .after the dislocated short story of the first chapter ,  the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces ,  interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story .   it frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book .shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's ,  when the americans arrive ,  focusing ,  as i noted before ,  primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war .  i should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own .   here ,  however ,  it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-americans worthy of a story .  or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the british or french perspective .and ,  i have no particularly problem with him focusing on the american perspective on the war ,  but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry ?   i suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well .for those interested in historical fiction ,  i would recommend bernard cornwall's work .   and ,  perhaps ,  shaara can learn a bit from him
i've read every one of iris johansen's  " suspense "  novels and have loved most of them .   the last couple though have been so painful to get through .  this one however ,  i don't think i can even finish .   i read where someone called these characters  " cardboard ,  "  and i couldn't agree more .   the female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist .   whereas in the eve duncan books and the wind dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters ,  it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class .    " now this should happen here ,  and this here ,  and this here and boom ,  climax ,  happily every after .  "i hope that iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time .
being a student of photojournalizm in moscow ,  russia ,  i looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available .  i had studied one book on the subject by the russian author ,  but knowing that photography in the us is much more developed and professional i was striving to get a book by a professional photographer .i was disappointed by the book  " photographic composition "  by tom grill for a number of reasons :1 .  it does not cover all important compositional elements ,  and those that it covers are not explained in full detail .  it does not explain :- how elements with the similar shapes ,  similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other ,- the reverse perspective effect and its uses ,- why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why ,  how it can be used on practice ,- how to balance  " weight "  of different elements of the photograph ,  it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example ,- difference between compositional center and the center of interest ,  how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo  ( does not match each other )- all signs of perspective ,  it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective  ( trivial as it may sound ,  it still should be marked in any complete work ,  especially when the author covers other three elements )- and much much more .2 .  it does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic ,  neither does it show how composition works in art ,  which i believe is very important .3 .  most examples are in color ,  while most ideas on composition are best explained using b&w photographs .4 .  last but not least ,  composition is about meaning ,  making a message ,  not just how to balance different elements within a frame .  the book makes this statement ,  but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples ,  while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good .overall :  i believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations ,  not just a few and briefly explained  " how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take "  .  this books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading .i'd be very grateful if you could recommend me  ( and other folks that look at our reviews )  a more thorough book on composition ,  i'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject .  thanks !p . s .  for those who can read in russian i advise a book by a .  lapin  " fotografiya kak .  .  "  ,  which compared to the book by tom grill explains composition in full
i am a huge fan of kathy reichs' novels and of the tv series ,  bones .  however ,  this book was quite a disappointment to me .  i did not care for the way the author wrote dialogue -- brennan's dialog is not that simplimatic on the tv program ,  and she certainly would never say ,   " where at !  ?  "  the author way overused the joke where brennan did not  " know what that means .  "all i could think of was how much better this novel would have been if written by reichs herself .i started to jot down the holes in the story but quit after a while
this book has taken photo after photo straight out of the ikea catalogue !  obviously ,  the authors have decided that they have nothing to offer and opt instead to refer to ikea's design and storage ideas .  this book actually put me in a bad mood .  listen up folks ,  the ikea catalogue is free .  do yourselves a favour and pick one up ,  because none of these so-called  " organization "  books have anything to teach you that cannot be found at your local ikea store .  these authors should be fired .  shame on both of them
don't be excited about this book's small size and light weight ,  the text needs more examples to support you while doing homework .   breif chapter explantions caused me to nearly fail my class .   was not a gret book ,  in fact many students complained to the dean regarding this book .   good luck
this is a very bad book .  it is poorly written ,  the characters are caricatures in misery ,  and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter ,  who suffers in silence after the devastating ,  and ,  to her ,  mysterious ,  death of her mother .  her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter .  he is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior ,  which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response ,  rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion .  he fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break .  i couldn't finish this .  it is drivel
the whole concept of this book as well as the honesty of the undertaking :  i'm not buying it .  the author's effort is half-a**ed at best .besides the musings and excessive self-praise ,  it is downright preachy .their effort might pass as non-consumerism for new yorkers ,  but would never pass in the rest of america .don't buy it
i must admit i was skeptical when i first opened this book based on previous knowledge i had of mpd .   this book made me that much more skeptical .   in most cases of mpd or did as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist .   this case is different though .   on page 67 of the paperback copy i got ,  ms chase describes stanley ( her name for phillips )  as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other .   her answer that she or as she claims her  " troops "  give is that it is through the use of  " thought transference "  which was known to the ancient greeks as she tells us later on .   i almost burst out laughing when i read that .   she also contradicts her claim that the alters don't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters rabbit and sister mary catherine at the same time .   another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we' .   many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies .   the abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic .   her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories ,  ufo sightings ,  satanic ritual abuse ,  and second sight .   i think she is not credible in the least .   there is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them .   she does let us know in the book that she is very creative ,  artistic ,  intelligent ,  and apparently well read .   i think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities .   the book itself is long ,  boring ,  anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end .   she also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities .   don't waste your money on this book ,  unless you have to read it for a class as i did .
i've read five of the nine  " temperance brennan "  mysteries that kathy reichs has published ,  but this is my least favorite .  i lost interest about two-thirds through .  i felt the villains were not fleshed-out ,  the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely ,  the ending too neatly contrived ,  and the personal/romantic side story too awkward .  this one was also too long ,  by about 50 pages .  reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients ,  yet they did not blend into a successful flavor .  the other four of her novels were fine .  i love the tv series as well ,  although  " bones "  allegedly shows dr .  brennan much earlier in her career ,  with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books .  in the tv series ,   " dr .  brennan "  has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly .  in the books ,  her lesser characters all seem .  .  . lesser ,  indeed .  better luck next time out ,  dr .  reichs
when i picked up true believer ,  i was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters .   neither panned out .   this book is boring .   the characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery .   too much detail and not enough substance .   not sure what the point of the story was as i didn't get it
mr .  o'nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing .   his skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people ,  events ,  etc .  ,  is downright frustrating and confuses the project .   unlike superior literary treatments  ( see walter lord's titanic )  ,  this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long ,  hot shower .
this play explores the same old turf as  " death of a salesman "  ,  but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development .   eddie is no willy loman ,  though ,  and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central ,  driving force like willy .   parts of the play seem borrowed from tennessee williams ,  and they don't seem to work in this context .   there is some business about the romance of the old world italy versus the new world of opportunity on the docks of new york ,  and it is the only topic that is at all explored well ,  if still unsatisfactorily .   eddie's dreams are represented in his pretty niece ,  catherine ;  and unlike willy loman's uncle ,  she is still an attainable dream .  that makes eddie's life seem all the more petty ,  in comparison to willy's :  he longs wearily not after what he could have had ,  but after what he can never have ,  as he is already married .   the death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced ,  tacked on ending ,  and alfieri's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick .   there are better plays by miller ,  and many better plays by others
toward the end of how now shall we live ,  chuck colson states ,  regarding popular music and media ,  that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet .  however ,  he warns ,  a diet of junk food can be fatal .good advice concerning pop culture-but even more applicable to this book .  yes ,  it contains a kernel of truth ,  but it ultimately is dangerous if not balanced by a heavy diet of other thinkers and theologians such as thomas merton ,  st .  francis of assisi ,  ron sider ,  tony campolo ,  brian mclaren ,  brother lawrence ,  philip yancey ,  wendell berry-the list goes on .  it often is guilty of oversimplifying the ideological conflicts the modern church faces ,  drawing the lines down to  " christians "  against the  " naturalists "  or  " humanists ,  "  thus ignoring the wide range of threats that seek to destroy the church .while there is truth in colson's writing ,  i believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by comfortable middle-class american thought and militaristic nationalism ,  sprinkled with the politically correct amount of christian belief .  his faith seems to be overly academic ,  one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and other spiritual disciplines .  evangelism ,  it seems to colson ,  is comprised heavily of apologetics .  the secularists must be shown that they are wrong ,  he says .  yes ,  there is truth and there is time for debate ,  but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships .you see ,  i used to fear evolutionists and the proverbial round table of  " secular humanists "  that many conservative evangelicals love to discuss .  but as i've grown ,  i realize that threats to the church come more often from within than from secular culture ,  and they almost always have more to do with power and politics than the enlightenment or science .
of all the textbooks i've had ,  from elementary school through graduate school ,  this is easily the worst one i've ever had ,  for any course .first of all ,  the authors so redundantly use the word  " whilst "  and the phrase  " rules of the game "  that it really gets on your nerves .  my classmates all agree with me on this point .second ,  speaking of getting on your nerves ,  half of what these authors say is ,   "  .  .  . as we talked about in the previous chapter "  or  " as we'll talk about in the next chapter "  .  there is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size ,  and hell ,  it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course .third ,  the authors should win a pulitzer prize for flowery language .  they seem more interested in impressing me than educating me .  their sentences are far too long .  they don't know the meaning of clear and concise ,  and i think they should all go back to english composition 101 .  they'd be great politicians ,  because never have i heard anyone say so much and yet say so little .  .  .  . over and over and over again .the book is a like an inflated academic paper .  .  . and it's boring .  if ever a topic begged for a case-study approach ,  it's this one ,  and this book is not the answer .  save your money ,  and beg your instructor not to use this text .
book is out of date with modern economic thought .   essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets .
the ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book .   it was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real ludlum books
my brother had severe acne a year or so ago that he inherited from my dad's side of the family .   he had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on accutane .   having heard bad things about the side effects ,  my dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication .   he faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever .   some of the ideas in the book are absurd - as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne ,  i can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous .   when i was a teenager ,  i'd go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible ,  and i got through high school with only the occasional zit .   i've read that for a small number of people ,  diet can be a factor for acne ,  but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause  ( this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition isn't sexy )  .   since medication should always be a last resort ,  a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes ,  but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere .   for the curious ,  while my brother had some strong side effects from the accutane  ( none dangerous ,  primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes )  ,  it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin
you can tell i don't pay attention to wall street journal or new york times .  i picked up david sacks' book from borders' linguistics stack because of the title .  i should have known better .i started the first chapter and didn't have the time or intention to finish it .  the book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks ,  in my opinion ,  systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works  ( scholarly it is not )  .even within the first 20 pages or so ,  i was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims ,  utter misinformation ,  and distastefully euro/english-centric .  here are some examples :" the alphabet was not the earliest writing :  egypt ,  mesopotamia ,  and probably china already had nonalphabetic systems .  but the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found ,  before or since  ( p . 1 )  "  -- what about hirogana for japanese ?  syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables ." the 'spreadability' of an alphabet means that the future of our roman letters looks very bright indeed .   ( p .  10 )  "  -- he was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets ,  such as swahili ,  serbo-croatian ,  urdu/hindi ,  and yiddish .  and then came this proud comment on the prospect  " our roman letters "  .  immediately following the above quote ,  he gave examples of azerbaijian and tatarstan's decision to switch to roman ,  as well as other  " struggling nation " 's likewise decisions to  " switch to roman letters for native tongues ,  as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn english .  tragically ,  much that is venerable and spiritually sustaining while be lost .  yet that seems inevitable in the 21st century were are shaping .  and it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield such power .  "his view of the learnability of the alphabet is also uneducated ,  shall i say .  the following superficial comment could have come from an old gradama who happened have not been a teacher for her lifetime ." an alphabet enjoys on huge advantage over any other writing system :  it needs fewer symbols .  no other sysmtem can get away with so few .  this makes an alphabet easier to learn .  students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy ,  which typically takes about another five years of instruction "  .and -- he writes -- because of this simplicity ,  children can become literate before the working age .   " this cricial fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy .   ( p . 5 )  "  well ,   " vehicle "  is a very clevery way of framing it .  at least he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is mass literacy .  mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution .  now sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who's by implying that the europeans and western ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from god .   ( guns ,  what guns ?  )sacks also compared  " our 26 letters "  -- as if alphabetic writing is patented at the uspo -- to chinese .   " today chinese schoolchildren normally take three years longer than western children to learn to read and write ,  with most of thatextra time devoted to mastering the symbols .  "this is completely misinformation .  learning to read chinese is not easy ,  but do a little research ,  you will find studies over studies and books over books on comparitive studies of literacy  ( including my own )  .  i've nevery seen a credible study that substantiates the 3-year lag .  by the way ,  sacks almost never gives citations .i think that's enough .  this explains my total disappointment with the book -- i sholdn't have any high expectation from the start ,  had i known who david sacks is .
since i listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as tony roberts performance was so bad ,  it was impossible to follow the story line .   he read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did .   in addition to the slooooow reading ,  his characterization were completely over the top .   dino sounded like a moron and  " billy bob "  well like a texas moron .   and what about billy bob ,  that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story .skip this this one or prepare to suffer
this book really irritated me .  i loved mayes's previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one .  the concept ,  a year of traveling to different locations ,  seemed like it would be really interesting combined with mayes' fresh perspectives ,  enthusiasm for discovery ,  feisty opinions and poetic descriptions .  but somehow it didn't work .i get the sense that her heart wasn't really in this book .  maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years ,  and cobbled together ?  or because there's so much `padding' - endless quotes from her own or other people's writing .  when she liked the place ,  her descriptions feel artificially enthusiastic ,  almost as if the book was paid for by the chamber of commerce .  i got tired of reading that she could live there ,  or could imagine taking her grandson there ,  or wishes she was born there ,  or that it's so much better than san francisco .  where she doesn't live anymore ,  and hasn't for years .  there are also too many stories about refreshing local characters who think frances mayes is the nicest ,  most tasteful ,  most interesting person they've ever met .  especially since these people tend to be waiters ,  cab drivers ,  rug salesmen or others whose business depends on charming the tourists .most of the book consists of sneering at her fellow americans ,  or talking about people's personal appearance .  this is boring and clich�d - and if you like that kind of thing ,  bill bryson does it better .  there's also way too much name dropping  ( she's always mentioning  " my friend so-and-so ,  the famous ____ "  )  .  what happened to the ordinary ,  financially stretched ,  middle-aged college professor ?  she seems to be taking on the persona of a celebrity .  she doesn't want to be crowded in with a group ,  doesn't want to associate with ordinary tourist types - now she deserves the vip treatment .  this is definitely a change from her previous books .i think when it comes right down to it ,  there's too much frances mayes in this book .  i thought i liked her ,  but what i really like is her writing style .  it can still be magical - when she gets her ego out of the way .  but when she puts herself front and center ,  she becomes more tedious and pretentious than interesting .  now i'm sorry i read this book ,  because i'm afraid it will spoil my enjoyment of the earlier ones .
most of the information is very  " theoritical "  and  " limited "  -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her .    .  .  .   in a nutshell ,  the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter ( s )  ,  and in turn ,  the daughter ( s )  may pass that onto her offspring ( s )  .    .  .  .
samantha seems a lot like becky .   a young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions .   instead of staying at the firm and working out her  " mistake ,  "  she runs away .   this is just like becky hiding her bills .   and then she gets a totally implausible job ,  because she can't tell the truth - again like becky .   samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to .i agree that the firm would never have taken her back ;  they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care .   samatha ,  like becky at times ,  seems somewhat manic ,  in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation .   just like becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared .   lithium ,  anyone ?i don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer  " controversy ,  "  but i do think kinsella's protagonists need to grow up
my first grisham novel ,  and it reminded me of why i seldom read fiction .   the plot has numerous barely-believable twists ,  the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility .   said lawyer then drives from memphis to new orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion .   absurd !   no attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing !the  " storybook ending " just prior to the boarding of the fbi director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy .   also ,  i highly doubt that the fbi director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases .thankfully ,  i paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago .   given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level  ( and i have no children )  ,  it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall .first grisham = last grisham
i hold martin's song of ice and frie series in high regard ;  the man is a talented writer .   for adults .the problem with this book is that it reads exactly like whay you'd expect a chlidren's book written by george r . r . martin to read like .   by this i mean violent imagery and the occasional immolation of soon-to-be-dearly-departed-uncles .    ( and as an uncle i object to this wanton anti-uncle setiment running rampant in children's literature !  !  !  )there seems to be no age group for this book .   the story isn't that engrossing ,  and a kid i'd feel comfortable buying a book for containing this level of violence would most likely want something more substanial .   though for adults i strongly recommend martin's other books over mr .  pratchett ,  when it comes to books for kids about this age level i've gotta go with pratchett's wee freemen over this .or ,  for slightly younger kids ,  the persistent gappers of firth .   hell ,  eveybody loves the gappers of firth .
it is now more than a month after i was supposed to receive this book and i have not gotten it yet ,  what the hell is going on
please take this to heart .  .  .  .i love mr .  belushi's acting ,  he's funny and all .  .  . i have nothing against his career and respect him for making all the changes he did in his life .  .  .but .  .  . i cannot say this louder then this :not all women are the same !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !i was reading this ,  i knew what i was to expect .  .  . so i went in with some knowledge .i love a real man ,  i love a real man !  !   i am not your a-typical woman and i will kill or die trying to remain myself .   when ever i see book after book or hear more and more about this  .  .  .  .  .  i just fume because i will be the first to admit women's lib destroyed womanhood !but and i repeat but .  .  . not all women are for women's lib and all the damage caused is not supported by all women .i am destroyed by people like mr .  belushi because they think i am one of the group called 'all women' and am judged because i belong to this group .his book is the most selfish book i have ever read and again ,  do not get me wrong about being a man ,  i support it and can't stand a man who can't be a man .  .  .  .for me ,  money is not status ,  a career is not status and marriage does not complete me !   if you fail at making the money you want ,  i'll encourage you to lift your spirits and never tell you what job to do .  .  . if you don't have the money to take me out or buy me anything ,  i don't judge the quality of who you are ,  i will enjoy a night in front of the dvd player with you and i'm happy !   i don't ask you to call because i'm checking up on you ,  i ask you to call and let me know you're safe .  .  .  . i don't snoop in your stuff because i'm nosey ,  i respect your privacy because i trust you - give me reason to stand up and not take your crap and i will ,  but only after i shower you with unconditional love and acceptance because i give it to you ,  and if that still hasn't reached you ,  all i can do is then stand up for myself where my man should be protecting me .yes ,  chivalry is the key to this girls heart ,  but you better have a set to back that up too !your friends are my friends and i love them because i love you and you love them .  .  . nothing more ,  but they sure do take by destroying us since they don't have the 'us' in their own lives .  .  .i support and wish there were more real men out there .  .  . there are only two wants from this woman to her man 1-don't cheat on me and lie to my face ,  i need that security  ( pay attention ,  my security does not come from your paycheck ,  it comes from your arm wrapped around me ,  protecting me with your love )  and 2- it is your job to take care of us and when you can't ,  i am right there to get your back not to get in your way ,  not to diminish you ,  but to help you when you say you need my help .that did not cost you your friends ,  did not cost a penny and it did not cost you your freedoms as a man .   i give freely ,  lovingly ,  unconditionally and always not because of the notches on your bedpost ,  not because it cost you a dime ,  not because you did it my way ,  not because you gave up one dang thing - i gave you every reason to want to give me your arm around me and your want to protect me .two things is all i need to give you an entire lifetime of love ,  honor ,  respect and every ounce of my body to you .  .  . freely .  .  . got it ?  ?  ?i am halfway through the book and realized that yeah ,  i love one of the biggest jerks out there because of who he's become ,  i will love him til the day i die and will always and i mean always give him that love ,  respect as a man and honor him as my man .  .  .  . because 'i' want to change me to be a better woman ,  not because he got whipped into what i wanted him to be !not all women fit the bill of true wamonhood but i sure am dang proud of myself that i strive for it
the book claims to help you :1 .  say goodbye to aching joints ,  sagging skin and fatigue2 .  improve the quality and function of the genetic material in your cells3 .  ramp up your body's self-repair functions4 .  increase your stamina ,  endurance and sex drive5 .  dramatically improve your resistance to disease ,  including cancers6 .  have more youthful ,  radiant skinyou don't need to be a cynic to be able to tell that the claims are all inflated .  sure ,  you'll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle ,  but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet ,  some of the tips on progressing further to  " genetic repair "  will sound a bit too good to be true .in fact ,  most of the advice and recommendations given in the book are not very different from that found in many other books on nutrition and supplement .  the authors just gave all the info a  " dna twist "  .  i stopped reading the book a few chapters from the end when it begins to talk about hormonal supplementation and some glowing testimonial on the author's services .  all  " natural "  ?  no side effects ?  how long have the subjects been followed up and how long have physicians really practised hormonal therapy on otherwise healthy individuals ?  the results may be real ,  but how safe is it for the rest of subject's life ?sounds like another one of those practice-promoting books in this genre .  disappointing
this book is built around the idea  " i wish it were true = it is true "  .   while this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives ,  if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life  ( i . e .  intellectual integrity )  ,  you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability
not only do i disagree with his opinions ,  but some of his facts are blatently false .   on page 106 he refers to violence agains native americans by european settlers as  " isolated instances "  and not planned nor calculated .   had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable
this book belongs in the fantasy section of the library .let's start with the question of israel's borders .   do some folks say that these borders ought to be the nile and euphrates rivers ?   after all ,  israel is kind of small .   doesn't it need ,  um ,  a tiny bit more land ?well ,  israel may need a little more land .   but almost nobody is proposing anything like this .   i see very few israeli politicians demanding even all of the west bank ,  let alone all of jordan .   and as for the nile to the euphrates ,  this is pretty much exclusively anti-zionist propaganda .   there's a nice article by daniel pipes in the march ,  1994 issue of middle east quarterly that goes into this in some detail ,  in case anyone cares .yes ,  we've seen propaganda before .   in the 1930s ,  some germans claimed that the jews were planning to take over the whole world .   now ,  what do we see in this book ?what we see in this book is chris hedges quoting someone as saying that israel allows state-funded religious schools to preach that jewish rule should extend from the nile to the euphrates .   is there any connection between this and truth ?yes ,  there's a connection .   you see ,  in the bible  ( in deuteronomy )  ,  moses says at one point that israel's borders shall run from the river euphrates to the  " western sea "   ( presumably ,  the mediterranean ,  but definitely not the nile )  .   of course ,  someone might want to ask a jewish authority about what the bible says .   it turns out that there's much more detailed material in the book of numbers ,  and that is what pipes says religious jews are taught is biblical .   and that specifies a much smaller israel .   in addition ,  it is quite a leap to go from biblical borders ,  no matter how large or small ,  to preaching that jews ought to rule such an area today .   hedges is doing us a big disservice here .   you may want to check all this for yourselves .in addition ,  hedges has an exciting description of the battle of khafji  ( which took place during desert storm )  .   some people who were really there dispute it ,  however .   you may want to check that as well .we also see hedges describe the behavior of israeli soldiers in gaza on june 17 ,  2001 .   now ,  remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders .   their superiors know that israel can't afford unnecessary violence .   the soldiers are there to protect lives ,  not to hurt or kill others .   and in fact ,  it turns out to be true that in the fighting between jews and arabs ,  the jews  ( as expected )  have rarely been guilty of gratuitous violence .   on the other hand ,  the arabs ,  who have rather different goals and constraints ,  have displayed quite a bit of bad behavior .nevertheless ,  in spite of logic and facts to the contrary ,  in this book ,  hedges comes up with the following  ( as usual ,  i encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is ,  and you might want to start by finding out how many people died that day and who they were )  :" i had seen children shot in other conflicts that i had covered - death squads gunned them down in el salvador and guatemala ,  mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in algeria ,  and serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in sarajevo - but i had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport .  "well !   what is it about israelis that could lead them to behave in such a surprising manner ?   hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of nasty reading material about the holocaust has perverted these unfortunate young men .   well ,  i'm perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material .   but i don't buy hedges' absurd conclusion at all .   nor do i buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers .   and no ,  i'm not in denial .   if you believe hedges ,  i think you may be in denial ,  though !i'll stop here .   anyone capable of saying what i've quoted from hedges so far is capable of saying anything .   we readers do not need this .
if you want a biased and misleading account of the arab war against israel ,  this ought to satisfy you .shlaim tells us that jabotinsky ,  in discussing zionism explained that  " if the cause is just ,  justice must triumph .  "i think jabotinsky made a very good point here .   you see ,  human beings will ,  if given the chance ,  tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in .   the ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land .   if injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it  ( which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it )  ,  then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here .   in particular ,  it would mean a prosperous israel and a triumph for zionism .shlaim appears to have missed all this .   to him ,  zionism is unjust .   and to him ,  the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable .   he tells us that a new independent levantine arab state  " is inevitable .  "   i disagree .   it may be likely .   but it would serve no purpose .   it would not help jews ,  arabs ,  or others .   its only purpose would be to damage israel .   the people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language ,  religion ,  culture ,  cuisine ,  or foreign policy .   so i think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here .shlaim also tells us that this new arab state will be  " weak ,  demilitarized ,  and territorially divided .  "   is it just possible that this ,  if true ,  provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all ?    and could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable ?   or at least less desirable ?and the author also explains that both sides in the arab-israeli conflict will have to make  " painful compromises ,  "  and that jerusalem will have to be  " the subject of hard bargaining .  "really ?is having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise ?   for either side ?   of course not .   shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war ,  poverty ,  and destruction are somehow less painful .had shlaim been writing about france and germany ,  we'd have seen at once that the whole viewpoint is nonsense .   he'd have been telling us that the german national socialists needed an independent state in france ,  either to replace all of france or part of it .   he would have laughingly dismissed french claims on the basis of the entire idea of france being unjust !   he'd have sternly explained that a german national socialist state in france was both desirable and inevitable .   and he would have discussed the necessary  " painful compromises "  for both sides and the  " hard bargaining "  about paris .there are plenty of reasonable books about the arab war against israel .   this isn't one of them
this book is seriously out of date for modern web design and development
i was disappointed in this book--especially after reading the other stellar reviews  ( which are all ,  weirdly ,  from texas ,  where the author lives )  .when it's a book about logic and clear thinking ,  a reader expects that book to be free of typographical errors ,  imprecise logic ,  and muddled thinking .   needless to say ,  i almost put the book down after reading the introduction because of the missing words and typographical errors .   exampe from page 11 :    " because the real is out there ,  we must effectively with it .  .  .  .  "   here's another gem from the same page :    " i am sorry to have to tell you that fact ,  but that is the way things are .   that is the nature of nature .   that is the reality of reality .  "look at page 33 .   the author states ,   " why when one exception is uncovered ,  multiple other exceptions surface almost right away is not entirely clear .  .  .  .   probably this has something to do with the way we humans view reality .  "   very disappointing--hasn't this author studied any cognitive psychology ?   it's called confirmation bias and it's entirely clear .one more example !   on page 60 ,  the author states that barbara boxer ,  a senator from california ,   " doesn't know the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol "  and is  " unlikely to shed intelligent light on the relative safety of either gun .  "   ouch .   how does he know what barbara boxer knows or doesn't know ?   she's actually very well-versed on the difference between the two ;  has he heard her speak on the subject ?   it comes across as more of an ad hominem attack than anything .anyway ,  save your money on this book and instead buy jamie whyte's crimes against logic .   now that's a well-written book !
i'd heard the buzz  ( both pro and con )  and thought i'd take an independent read .  i was dismayed with this book .james frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had .  one of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the truth so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him .  lies are what enable  " slips "  and  " enabling "  and  " denial "  and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure .  recovery is nearly impossible without honesty .  so ,  can we look at this man's  " memoir "  and expect it to offer anything of value ?  it's poorly constructed ,  repetitive ,  and narcisitic .  even if oprah hadn't exposed him ,  the writing takes the tone of  " whoppers "  like frey's account of the drug house visit in which he  " rescues "  lilly .  other reviewers and smoking gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one ,  and i can't improve on that .suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera .   story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life ,  the same way a million little pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction .  a real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result .i was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept .  like a joke of some kind .  i'm not laughing .
i came to blowback by way of a year-long research project on  globalization .  over the past year i have read dozens of books ,  both scholary and popular ,  on this topic .  right - left - love america - hate america - multi-cultural - eurocentric ;  i've suffered through them all  (  happily ,  there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject  )  .first let me state that chalmers johnson ,  this regrettable book notwithstanding ,  is not by profession the village diot .  johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst ,  a man who used to be worth listening to .what happened ?   how did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg ?  where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from ?  johnson ,  where did you go ?well ,  the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge .   his take on america's military policies is ludicrous .   anyone who questions why the u . s .  army is still in korea after 50+ years need only point to seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north ,  where he will discover north korea .  of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy .   conspiracy  " theory "  is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated ;  it's their sanctuary ;  but for a scholar of johnson's caliber to go there is incomprehensible .  unti you see what i saw .the professional works that i read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing ,  all in scholarly language .   for the most part the popular books were  not nominally about globalization at all ,  although globalization was the only thread holding the books together ,  and to each other .  brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s  (  you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril  )  , the only possible reason for these immensely angry ,  nonsensical books is this :  no one fully understands globalization .   no one .  even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast ,  too young to tame ;  growing unpredictably every day like the blob .  they're frustrated ,  these authors .   i can't blame them ,  but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the've rounded up the usual suspect ,  america ,  as in why does america impose - dominate - ignore ,  etc .  the third world ?   silly question ,  really .  you're at the top of the food chain ,  what do they expect you to do ?  when bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else .
i bought this book because of the 4 star rating by readers .   let me be candid .  .  .  . what the hell were they reading ?   this book is simply insipid ,  implausible and a waste of time .   get this for a premise .  .  .  . rich ,  geeky guy buys a major league baseball team called the  " connecticut nutmegs "  !   nutmegs for a major league team ?  ?  !  !   yeah ,  right .   it gets better .  .  .  . he has an incredibly sexy girl friend who stars in the c-list movies he produces .  .  .  . ok hold on to your seats ,  here comes the good part .  .  .  . she is going to be his star player on this major league baseball team !  !   why ,  because in college she was an excellent athlete .   so some buxom starlet who ran track in college is going to play major league baseball !  !   am i the only one who thinks this is plain stupid .   oh ,  yeah there's a murder along the way .   parker  ( author )  must have pictures of the publisher having sex with a goat otherwise i can't think of a reason why it got published .
i felt as if this book was way below my reading leve
trash sells and this is the definition of trash .  unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction .  shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research .  readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write
i enjoyed the first 3 books of the women's murder club .  didn't like too much the 4th  ( of july )  ,  but the 5th is just bad  !  what's the plot  ?  there is no plot  !  2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner ,  the 1st mystery  ( car girls )  get solved mid-way throught the book and i bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read .  .  .  by trying to develop 2 stories ,  patterson gets our interest for none .  the most sad thing of all is that i used to like to women's murder club members ,  but now they all seem so unreal ,  remote from anything actually likeable .  and it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club ,  in the most stupid ,  artificial way really .  not much to save this book ,  it's even badly written .  don't know if patterson thinks about writting a 6th ,  but don't count on me next time
this book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms .  as a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure ,  i am always willing to learn  more about any kind of bodywork .  i had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it .  the book gives some accupoints for specific problems ,  some of these are  " golden points "  able to stand alone in use ,  but others are not .  the book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence ,  or not .  also , it does't tell where the points are exactly .  there are really too many flaws to go into here .  acupressure is very complex ,  this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo
i thought this book was a waste of my reading time .   i saw a review on the today show ,  and read several postive reviews as well ,  and it piqued my interest .   what i thought may be a book about how to deal with and accept the coming changes/challenges of a mother/pre-teen daughter relationship was a book about a mother seeming to tiptoe around her daughter's emotional state .   what is sarah going to think about this ,  what is she going to say about that ,  etc .  ?   the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that i applaud the time spent karen and sarah spent together .   something that should be done in all parent-child relationships .i would like to think there are better books on this subject .
mr .  winchester takes an interesting subject ,  collects enough material to make a fine article in ,  say ,  national geographic ,  and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length .    ( case in point ,  a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid ,  but loses it ,  and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss .  ick .  self-induldgent .   boring .  )   worse ,  still ,  even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material ,  such as relates ,  say ,  to the subject's wife ,  all mr .  winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations .   i guess extensive research might have been too time consuming .   numerous times i considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful ,  but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going ,  hence my review of two stars .john mcphee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than mr .  winchester ,  and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story
the book is amazing !   the cd is horrible !   stick to reading the book yourself .   i have over 45 audio books .  .  . and this was like listen to a bad commercial .   i had to turn it off .  there is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading .   they don't even state who the narrator is !i recommend the book to anyone .   the content is life changing
the original julie and romeo was delightful .  this book was utter nonsense .   a great disapointment .  finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along .  it didn't
sheppard's attempt to capture the  " american youth angst "  failed miserably .  instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through .   i never developed any connection or understanding of the characters .   each chapter seemed to stumble into the next ,  with the end as predictable as the next expletive sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge .   you'd do better saving your money ,  driving to the nearest mall ,  and find the kid in the anarchy t-shirt looking sullen ,  because it appears that is all sheppard did in this work .   phew stinker-rooney !
this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything .  i didn't even like the story .  i would give this book a big fat zero if i could !  !
i bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day .  .  . i have the receipt stuck in the book .  .  . i can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then i just can't stomach anymore and i put it down for 2 more years .  maybe this is a piece of art .  something to be treasured and something that should change your life .  but pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful .  i wish the store would take it back - but i think i've probably had it for too long
really tried to like this book .  premise was grand ;  story bobbed and weaved ;  conclusion was flimsy .  discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient .  crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow .  i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak ;  they don't come across to the reader as likeable
hey here's an idea .  what if hitler was right all along ,  only it is men ,  not jews ,  who are to blame for all the woes of the world .  we should build a new auschwitz and exterminate them all .  right andrea ?  in my opinion ,  this is just as bad as any misogynist .  it's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long
this is not what i expected or wanted .   the book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature .   the description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use
you have to ask yourself ,   " why did william grimes think there was the need for another culinary dictionary ?  "  .   as you read the book ,  the answer comes quickly ,  before you're even very far into the  " a's "  .  .  .  apparently he didn't .i was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory ,  often puerile definitions which accompany most of the 2000 culinary terms grimes presents .   the simplistic line or two of text each are accompanied by are often incomplete and sometimes down right misleading .the introduction builds up the book as a necessary tool to help we little folk through the growing complexities of modern food buying and eating .   in a world no longer dominated by a few french terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between old-school cooking books  ( say ,  from before 1990 )  and the current state of culinaria .   why then are so many of the terms defined in an out-dated ,  even archaic mind-set ?take  the term  " brown sugar "  .   this book says it is  " unrefined or partially refined sugar "  ,  a definition all well and good perhaps 200 years ago .   today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very different thing indeed ,  and grimes should know the difference .   the are innumerable other examples available in the same vein .additionally ,  grimes give us   " food lists "  scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them .   for example ,  there is a list of varieties of apples .   48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking .   sure  " red delicious "  apples have an insipid definition in the  " r "  section but what about the more interesting varieties like  " sundowner "  ,  or  " lodi "  apples ?   no further mention of them can be found in the book .   there is also a huge list of   " fish and seafood "  but if you are intrigued by what the  " geoduck "  or  " sprat "  listed might be ,  you're out of luck  ( without running to a real culinary dictionary )  .the bright  ( if limited )  spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history .   there are 7 of them  ( reprints from other publications and various authors )  that are each informative and interesting .   grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these little insightful gems and left the definitions to those more inspired by the subject .my guess is that the brevity of the definitions  ( leading to rampant deficiencies )  was ,  perhaps ,  an attempt at simplicity but the effective  " dumbing-down "  of the book is insulting to anything but the most elementary reader .   i know that grimes ,  a former restaurant reviewer for the new york times ,  must know a lot more about food than this book makes him sound .   grimes is listed as the  " editor "  of this work  ( along with a number of others )  and it defies logic why he would allow his name used as the primary .unfortunately ,  my copy of this book is destined for  " re-gifting "  or a permanent place on a dusty shelf somewhere while my venerable ,  dog-eared larousse gastronomic retains it's place of honor near my desk .bon appetite ,  ex libris ,  and caveat emptor .  dh
the 20% you need to know :  this book is poorly written ,  and the author would do well to use the 80/20 principle in his writing .the 80% that will make up the rest of the review :  i have never read such boring prose .  i've had the concept fully explained to me .  i fully understand what the principle is .  i have heard it about 80 times now when 20 would have been enough  ( actually ,  once would have been enough )  .  now ,  what do i do with it ?  how do i implement it into my life ?  i am now on page 53 and he still hasn't gotten around to that part .  it seems to me he should have used the theory when writing this book .  cut to the chase !  give me the top 20% of useful information so i can go ahead and use it to increase my productivity and effectiveness by 80% .  instead i get the feeling i'm wandering around aimlessly in the bottom part of his bar charts among the 80% of fluff to fill up his book quota .  how many stories about economists and computer software do we really need ?  i don't know about you ,  but i wanted to increase my productivity by using my time better ,  and reading this book so far has been a complete waste of it
it's no wonder that people look at me strangely when i explain a great love of history to them .   it's books like this that persist in the ruination of history for many a student .   if this book were more widely  circulated ,  the need for sleeping pills would be drastically reduced .   i  have no idea how the author could take something this interesting and make  it so boring that i would literally fall asleep reading it
ridiculous ,  convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring .did cornwell even write this one herself ?  if so ,  she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread :  on page 216 marino remembers mrs .  paulsson greeting him at the door  " wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater "  ,  but later when he tells scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door .perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened .  however ,  to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct
if julia glass had not set the bar so high with three junes ,  i would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2 .   there are sentences ,  paragraphs ,  even pages of brilliance in this book ,  but it is as if winning the national book award gave ms .  glass unconditional confidence in her writing ,  and character development in particular .   she seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around .   as another reviewer wrote ,  the writing process seemed transparant .   reading the book ,  you get the feeling that the characters are what ms .  glass  ( a privileged white woman of a certain age )  imagines teenagers ,  or new mexicans ,  or black chauffeurs ,  or hispanic nannies ,  or even gay people to be like .   she is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them .   the teenagers and the santa fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures .   greenie might be the most believable ,  and although i understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy alan ,  i wasn't sucked along with her when she falls in love with  " the other charlie "  .   he was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth  ( even temporarily )  losing your child over .   with saga ,  she manages to develop her most sympathetic character ,  but saga's life is left floating and unresolved at the end .   even the brief appearance of fenno ,  who i loved in three junes ,  lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky .   all and all ,  a very disappointing second novel .   you have to wonder ,  since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character ,  what good is her editor ?
i find it very difficult to get through half of this book .  i have put it down and picked it up more times than i care to mention .  it is a waste of time .  awful book .  .
2 stars for decent writing  ( at least a decent translation )  ,  for an intriguing start ,  and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf .   that's pretty much it .   negative stars aplenty for the protagonists -- coy and tanger  ( i listened to nc on 13 endless tapes ,  so perhaps am misspelling their names )  .   the tortured metaphors they speak ,  think ,  and by which they -- and their insipid adventures -- are continually described ,  bore to tears .   aside from an occasional scrape between coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss ,  all of the action in nc clusters at the beginning  ( promisingly so ,  i'll grant )  and the end  ( all wimper ,  no bang )  of this novel .   as a salty seadog once said  ( no doubt anticipating this novel )  ,   " ahoy matey ,  thar .   she blows !  "
overall i found this guide pretty confusing ,  but i guess it is better than nothing .   there are better choices ,  and some may want to consider auto-formatting software such as eazypaper and others .
i rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it ,  but i couldn't take any more of look homeward ,  angel after part i  ( about 1/3 of the way through )  .   it was long ,  rambling ,  and most of the passages did not add anything to the story ,  not even in the way of atmosphere .   i do not recommend this book
in his book ,  the four agreements ,  don miguel ruiz ,  embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life .   he says that we should be impeccable with our words ,  not to take anything personally ,  don't make assumptions ,  and to always do our best .  the basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents .   he calls this process  " domestication "   ( p .  6 )  .  ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection .   the agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives .while there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book ,  some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what i would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion .  in some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims ;  however ,  in looking further ,  he takes some of the passages from the bible out of context .   some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas ,  but i would think most of us by a young age ,  should already an understanding of these principles .  although his book has been highly rated ,  i hold the position that mr .  ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer ,  therefore ,  losing good standing with me as a reader .according to ruiz ,  as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs .   when we go against the rules we are punished  ( or rewarded for compliance )  .  the fear of rejection leads us to agree with ,  or become something that we are not .  in essence ,  we become a carbon copy of someone else ,  such as our parents .   he says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements .   he boldly states ,  lacking statistical data to back it up ,  that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie  ( 13 )  .the implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless ,   " domesticated "  individuals ,  hurting ourselves ,  judging and victimizing other people along the way .   this kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives .  by his interpretation ,  if 95% of what we believe is a lie ,  then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie .   i would disagree .   there are many people who exist today as viable ,  productive members of society who i'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values .   if these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves ,  by his interpretation ,  we don't need parents ,  teachers ,  or leaders .  he undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path ,  which i believe is our right of passage .  by his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny .   instead ,  we become victims of it .one of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement ,  be impeccable with your word ;  however ,  he misquotes the bible  ( john 1 : 1 )  when he says  " in the beginning was the word and the word was with god ,  and the word was god .  "   he uses it to epitomize the use of  " word "  as in what one speaks  ( 26 )  .   looking a little further down in that passage ,  it also says  " the word was made flesh and dwelt among us "  .   this passage is not talking about a form of speech ,  or speaking ,  but rather  " jesus christ "  .   christ became flesh and dwelt among us .   in that same chapter he says that  " sin begins with rejection of yourself "   ( 31 )  .   however ,  in christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law  ( 1 john 3 : 4 )  and that sin is neglecting to do god's will  ( james 4 : 7 )  .   it's not about self ,  but about disobeying god's ordinances .  while i agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for ,  this is not a new concept .   most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say ,  don't say it at all .in his second agreement ,  don't take anything personally ;  he says that nothing people do is because of you .  while this is true to some degree ,  he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head ,  it was nothing personal .   so in essence ,  when mary jo buttafuoco was shot by amy fisher ,  her expression of displeasure regarding amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to ruiz  " you are dealing with yourself ,  not me "   ( 51 )  .   no ,  realistically ,  mary jo buttafuoco was shot because amy fisher wanted her dead .  this kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims .   as an american ,  i'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally .according to mr .  ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism .   it seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach ,  that i would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism .   when my college writing professor ,  gave me his opinion regarding my work ,  if i were following the authors line of reasoning ,  i would believe that my professor was  " trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage "  as mr .  ruiz suggests  ( 49 )  .  i would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer .another agreement is about not making assumptions in life .   he says when we make assumptions ,  in essence ,  we create unnecessary drama .   unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible .   assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason ;  even within the scientific community a hypothesis  ( or assumption )  is formed in order to test a theory .   in order come to school each day i must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree ,  and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday .in his forth agreement ,  always do your best ,  he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements ,  stating they will only work if you do your best .   again ,  these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned .while ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas ,  his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts ,  but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion .   i can't completely discount everything that he says ,  but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations .
when i reviewed the street lawyer recently ,  i mentioned that i've never put down a grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props .  for that book ,  certainly .  for this one ,  nope .  i read four chapters ,  41 of its 391 pages ,  and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot .  i hope he just had an off day or something ,  and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable .
i have been a huge fan of the anna pigeon mysteries .   the hard truth about hard truth is skip it .   it is a very unpleasant experience .the graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill .what i've loved about the anna pigeon series is that i felt like i got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area .   i doubt anna spent more than a night in rocky mountain national park .   not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story .   the whole thing could have taken place in urban chicago .i have been picking up nevada barr books as fast as i could find them .   this book ,  however ,  was truely repulsive .   i'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book
if you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy ,  then this is the book for you .  this book has no insight on anything .  it is vague .  it doesnt explain anything in detail .  it talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont .  each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing ,  but that is as far as that goes .  its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more !  you might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor .  it has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy
not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected .  i didn't really connect with the main characters .  i was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects  ( the lights )  it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story .
" of paradise and power "  - by robert kagan" americans are from mars and europeans are from venus "  - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows ,  this line by robert kagan author of  " of paradise and power "  ,  has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-atlantic relations .  kagan's thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating us-europe relationship ,  not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book .  kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book ,  in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between us and europe .  in the chapter  " the power gap "  ,  kagan starts from world war i to understand the aversiveness europe displays towards military and wars .  he argues that while both the world wars weakened europe tremendously ;  they helped the us emerge as a super power .  he further elaborates on the might of the us in the chapter that follows -  " psychologies of power and weakness "  .  kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies ,  but change perspectives as well .  he claims europe's paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the us force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods .  this chapter culminates into  " hyperpussiance "  ,  a chapter in which kagan discusses intricate details of kosovo and bosnia ,  highlighting europe's failure and america's effectiveness in handling the situation .  he finally presents his central argument in the chapters  " the post modern paradise "  and  " the world america made "  where kagan states ,   " europe's evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the u . s .  security guarantee and could not have occurred without it .  "  casting doubts on europe's intentions ,  kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west' in his chapter  " is it still `the west' "  ?finally ,  it seems kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the us-europe divide in his concluding chapter ,   " adjusting to hegemony "  ,  by simply stating one line -  " the task for both europeans and americans is to readjust to the new reality of american hegemony "  .  this extremely small book ,  as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining .  there are many issues to be addressed in kagan's brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims ,  reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled .  while there is a tone of underlying bias  ( in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds )  ,  kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures ,  not to mention present stark paradoxes ,  and the essay lacks sufficient citings .to start with ,  let me point out the contradictions in kagan's arguments ,  the presence of which highly undermines his claims ,  leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument .  kagan claims ,   " europe's relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful european interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power .  .  . rules of behavior "   ( pg . 37 )  .  he goes on to say ,  -  " since europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions ,  either individually or collectively as `europe , ' it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves .  "  ( pg . 38 )  in contrast to  "  .  .  . europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if europe wanted to become that kind of world power "   ( pg . 53-54 )  .  kagan contradicts his own views ,  stating many times that europe is militarily weak ,  nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time ,  puts forth an argument of europe's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the us .in the chapter ,  psychologies of power and weakness ,  kagan's one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential .  he first explains europe's greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past ,  which it has suffered from .  he then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat' when confronting a bear  ( pg . 31 )  .  but again kagan himself feels europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to ,  when he says  " they could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so "   ( pg . 54 )  .  so this forces me to ask a question ,  would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune ?  so isn't it quite possible that europeans feel safe ,  not because they  "  .  .  . enjoy the `free ride' they have gotten under the american security umbrella over the past six decades "   ( pg . 54 )  ,  but rather because there was and is no real threat at all ?with the use of phrases such as  " the axis of evil "  and  " rouge states "   ( pg . 30 )  ,  which kagan uses to describe iraq and iran ,  not to mention his references to `weapons of mass destruction'  ( which he uses as a pretext to the war in iraq )  ,  which still seem to be elusive for some reason ,  he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation .  while kagan maintains that iraq was a threat and the us perceived it as one while europe did not ,  he might want to explain as to why ,  in 1997 ,  he  ( kagan was the director of the project for the new american century )  signed a document which justifies american occupation of the middle-east ,  irrespective of threats from iraq or iran ." the united states has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in gulf regional security .  while the unresolved conflict with iraq provides the immediate justification ,  the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein .  .  .from an american perspective ,  the value of such bases would endure even should saddam pass from the scene .  over the long term ,  iran may well prove as large a threat to u . s .  interests in the gulf as iraq has .  and even should u . s . -iranian relations improve ;  retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in u . s .  security strategy given the longstanding american interests in the region .  "  ( pg . 17 - rebuilding america's defenses - *1 )this forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking' of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia .some of his reasoning ,  analysis and analogies seem to be too nave .  when explaining military action ,  one cannot justify it by saying ,   " when you have a hammer ,  all problems start to look like nails "  .  the author speaks about the nation's  ( us's )  willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so .  without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression ,  the author seems to be content in justifying use of force ,  simply because one has it .  one important aspect kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing us-europe feud .  while i have discussed some economical aspects later in the review ,  one must note that kagan does not mention the kyoto protocol  ( apart from clinton's negotiation of it  ( pg . 45 )  )  .  the us withdrawal from the protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants  ( www . climnet . org - *2 )  .  while there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire ,  disagreements over the anti-ballistic missile treaty for example ,  which kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet ,  needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations  ( www . bbcnews . com - *3 ,  4 )for a book which covers issues from the pre world war ii decade  ( occasionally going back to ancient philosophy )  to the present issues ,  72 citations ,  from which many are simply extended explanations  ( for examples ,  see supra notes- 19 ,  20 ,  22 )  ,  seem to be alarmingly low ,  especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention ,  certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts .  kagan mentions ,   " as `some' europeans put it ,  the real division of labor consisted of the united states making the dinner and the europeans doing the dishes "   ( pg . 23 )  ,  yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement .  he says ,   " the vast majority of europeans always believed that the threat  ( if any )  posed by saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him "  along with other alleging statements like ,   " the rehabilitation and reintegration of saddam hussein's iraq is precisely what they ( europe )  sought "   ( pg . 44 )   ,  and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs .  strangely ,  he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note . 20 ,  pg . 30 ,   " for that matter ,  this is also the view commonly found in american textbooks "  .  one might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations .  kagan at times jumps back to athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay .  he mentions a number of times how americans see the world from a hobbesian perspective while europeans are followers of kantinian policies .  kagan seems to have overlooked the fact ,  that though hobbes had described the state of nature as that of  " all against all "  ,  the only reason hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth .  kagan conveniently cites hobbes  ( hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `hobbes dilemma' )  to justify american aggression ,  but no where in hobbes' theory is aggression justified by the sovereign  ( leviathan - ch . 17 )  .there are some conclusions kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an american idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion .  he concludes that while the us was providing  " free security "  to europe after the cold war ,   "  .  .  . america's great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations .  .  .  "   ( pg . 34 )  has given europe the opportunity to build up economically .  kagan further asserts his point when he says ,   " given america's willingness to spend so much money protecting them ,  europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs ,  long vacations and shorter workweeks "   ( pg . 54 )  .  these are inaccurate presentations of facts ,  which are more of subjective ,  bias ideologies .  i would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements .  first ,  america's interest in europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the cold war .  one must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the soviet advance was purely for selfish motives ,  rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire  ( kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says ,   " with the check of the soviet power removed ,  the united states was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose .  .  .  "  ( pg26 )  )  .  second ,  when kagan acknowledges that europe which has a  " $9 trillion  "  economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending ;  attributing the fact that europe spends more on welfare ,  as he calls them  " free-riders "  ,  results in a faulty analysis .when i had mentioned earlier that kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts ,  the example of the balkans ,  which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant .  kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth us benevolence and european incapacity .   " american involvement in kosovo or bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow american `national interest' .  .  . while americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing ,  .  .  .  the us had no `national interest' at stake in the balkans "  ( pg . 50 )  ,  this is how kagan sees it .  indeed stopping genocide was a concern ,  but was it the only concern ?  while milosevic had very much agreed to station nato troops in kosovo to stop the conflicts ,  none seem to have been interested in his offer ;  they rather wanted complete access and control to all of yugoslavia .  the rambouillet accord ,  to which the contact group added an appendix b on the last day of the conference held at paris ,  one must note was the primary reason for rejecting nato troops ,  as it demanded yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty .  yet ,  he does not mention of milosevic agreeing to station nato troops in kosovo  ( http : //wsws . org *5 )  .some thing missing from kagan's entire book are the words  " latin america "  and  " africa "  .  as seen above ,  kagan believes america was spending its money protecting europe and europe alone from all the threats around the world ,  before and after the cold war .  but what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does kagan mention about any american intervention in latin america  ( official or not )  ,  africa or the far east for that matter .  those who are well aware of the world around them ,  will be aware of america's support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout latin america and the far east ,  indonesia for example ,  which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the latin american and african countries were a threat to europe ,  hence the interventions and no mention of them ?   ( a complete timeline by steven kangas can be found on multiple sites *6 ,  7 ,  8 )there is one severe `defect' ,  as i put it ,  which undermines the entire argument of this book .  kagan's tunneled vision approach ,  which refers to the word `power' only in terms of military strength and capabilities ,  ultimately results in a false dichotomy ,  which is the stumbling stone for his thesis .  kagan believes the world and in particular ,  europe ,  is left with two options ,  that either they follow the us or be a tacit audience .  the reason he reaches this conclusion as i previously put it ,  is due to his convergent view .   " rather than viewing the us as a gulliver tied down by lilliputian threads "  ,  says kagan ,   " american leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all ,  that europe is not really capable of constraining the us "  .  he reinforces this claim throughout his book  ( see pg- 33 ,  37-40 ,  59 ,  62 ,  etc )  .  the author's abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting ,  highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims .  kagan has committed serious errors here ,  by ignoring europe's strength ,  not military but political and economical indeed .  with a population of 456 , 953 , 258  ( the cia fact book *9 )  and still growing ,  the eu ,  leave aside europe ,  cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture .  europe is economically strong enough to trouble the us as and when it wants to ,  the recent problems over the genetically altered meat ,  banana dispute ,  steel industry debacle ,  airbus-boeing clash and many more ,  have all proved that europe's economic strength is much of a concern for the us .   while i must point out a rank deletion ,  i believe this is `the' single factor which is capable for arguing against all of kagan's thesis and arguments ,  and that is the american economy .  not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of american economy  ( 2001 )  ,  even though problems did exist when he wrote this book .  he seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that america can sustain its exorbitant defense spending ,   "  .  .  . the us can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future "  .  strangely ,  the growing inflation rate ,  rising unemployment ,  stagflation ,  trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession ,  were i believe dismissed as myths by the author  ( for statistics see - www . bbcnews . com ;  http : //wsws . org *10 ,  11 )  .  also ,  kagan's final solution suggest that ,   " the obvious answer is that europe should .  .  .  .  and build up its military ,  even if only marginally "  ,  leaves me with a conundrum .  is kagan implicating that europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race ,  this time cold war ii ?  kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those ,  whose ideologies are in tandem with his .  hence ,  i doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here ,  as we all know ,  there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts .while i have already discussed the effects of trade and economics  ( which kagan ignores )  on the us-europe relation ,  there is something i must point out before i end this review .  kagan ,  rather conveniently digresses of the topic ,  which is transatlantic relationships ,  to justifying us hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion .  while most americans themselves would probably not agree with kagan's ideology  ( as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12 )  ,  leave aside europeans or rest of the world ,  kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it .  this was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book ,  where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is  " adjusting to hegemony "  .  when kagan says how many  ( statistics seem to abandon him )  americans believe that by advancing their interest ,  they advance the interest of humanity ,  he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home ,  he quotes benjamin franklin as saying -  " america's cause is the cause of all mankind "  and again i must bring to the author's notice ,  the recipient of these remarks is an international audience ,  which is diverse ,  has its own culture and heritage ,  religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other .   an author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed .  while he seems to take pride in saying that america has a  " go it alone "  attitude  ( pg . 39 ,  99 )  ,  it does not abide by the un security council  ( pg . 40 ,  99 )  ,  takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws  ( pg . 45 ,  61 ,  99 )  ,  is justified in adopting `double standards'  ( pg . 62 ,  99 )  ,  he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day  ( or rather the day when he wrote this book )  situation and the growing unpopularity of american foreign policy around the world .  while he sees europe as an obstacle in the path of america's imperialistic goals ,  a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the us that hinders progress and efforts of the eu to establish a world which respects international laws ,  human rights ,  collective public opinion and most of all - peace .  he fails to give an impartial ,  if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying ,   "  .  .  . a little common understanding can still go a long way "  .  while many have nothing but words of praise ,  as a one line summary by francis fukuyama calls it -  " brilliant "   ( a co-architect and signatory of the rebuilding america's defense project )  and according to dr .  henry kissinger ,   [ against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied ,  who ironically ,  kagan terms as a  " quintessential realist "  .  see - http : //en . wikipedia . org ( for cases )  *13 ;  http : //www . thenation . com ( for list of crimes )  *14 ]  the book is a  " seminal treatise "  which would  " shape the  ( us-europe relation )  discussion for years to come "  ;  i do not particularly endorse it it .  as i have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument ,  sane reasoning or supportive evidence ,  though its lucid prose ,  easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read ,  it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution ,  apart from scratching the surface ,  `the military surface' .  indeed the book did create waves in the political arena ,  which was probably due to its impeccable timing ,  but i cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be  " discussed for years to come "  .*1   - http : //www . newamericancentury . org/rebuildingamericasdefenses . pdf*2   - http : //www . climnet . org/news/march2001 . html*3   - http : //news . bbc . co . uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385 . stm*4   - http : //212 . 58 . 226 . 30/1/hi/business/2052405 . stm*5   - http : //www . wsws . org/articles/1999/apr1999/yugo-a14 . shtml*6   - http : //www . atrocities . net/*7   - home . att . net/~resurgence/ciatimeline . html*8   - www . serendipity . li/cia/cia_time . htm*9   - http : //www . cia . gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee . html*10 - http : //www . wsws . org/articles/2000/dec2000/us-d30 . shtml*11 - http : //news . bbc . co . uk/1/hi/business/1263211 . stm*12 - http : //www . michaelmoore . com/words/index . php*13 - http : //en . wikipedia . org/wiki/henry_kissinger*14 - http : //www . thenation . com/blogs/capitalgames ?

i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book ,  the killer angels .   it is not fair to compare the two ,  but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one ,  i thought i should mention it .   this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book .   it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg ,  so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle .   but the result is a less satisfying book .   it skims rather than digs deep
even the avid  " trekie "  reader of the star trek science fiction novels ,  movies and television series must suspend disbelief ,  when he finds captain kirk saying  " beam me up ,  scotty .  "   but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort ,  when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world-wide  " rapture .  "   though the characters and their roles are fictitious ,  the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer .the story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass rapture event ,  and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions .in the september/october 2006 issue of foreign affairs walt mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions .instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform .   billy graham's biography by strober notes that they criticized graham's  " new evangelism "  for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems .  yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the  " tribulation force "  or as exemplified by jerry falwell's moral majority .they are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the united nations .  mead notes that it is no coincidence that the left behind novels show the antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the united nations .the u . s .  statistical abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially ,  while evangelicals and liberals - e . g .  southern baptists ,  lutherans ,  presbyterians ,  methodists - and catholics are continuing their per capita declines .   such data and the reported popularity of these left behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary american society .i see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the  " left behind "  in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern american society ,  and as conservative christians who believe it is better to stay behind .   and in not just a few respects ,  they may be wise to do so .thomas j .  hickey
while i applaud ms .  lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of janie hendrix's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit ,  there are some very serious credibility problems here .while even the idle hendrix fan knows jimi was born in king county hospital ,   ( now harbor view )  lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend .  ( ouch )  jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so 'no one can profit from them' . meanwhile cigarette packs  ( yes ,  cigarette packs )  and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to hendrix  , siting ms .  lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity .at one point she aledgedly quotes hendrix as saying :" the lsd passed around san francisco was a fabulous discovery for me ,  i'd taken acid in london but .  .  .  .  "aside from jimi's use of the word 'fabulous' being at best incredulous ,  the fact that hendrix had already tried lsd in new york in 1996 before going to england and subsequently monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable .  those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors ,  official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book ,  and the credibility of it's author are based on ,  extremely suspect .  at one point ms .  lawrence even offers an aledged quote from hendrix's mother who passed away in 1958 :" jimi baby "  she told her son  " i have to escape this "while quotes like this can illicit an emotional responsefrom the average reader , they are clearly  fictional .  throughout the book people close to jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted ,  if at all .  i shared the recount of jimi's trip to berkeley as a small child  ( pg . 5 )  with jimi's aunt delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories .  this from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip .  while making a reference to ernestine benson and misstakenly referring to her husband cornel  as  " bill "   ,  lawrence again allegedly quotes hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the benson's who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the hendrix's .lawrence's assertion that hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than jimi's adopted stepsister janie's claim that jimi didn't od .   lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for monika's suicide ,  but the jist is clear .  this book is more than a bit narcissistic with lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject .  while proclaiming herself to be a close confident of hendrix' the general consensus is that she wasn't around that much ,  if people even know who she is at all .for a much more well researched and credible look into jimi's life read electric gypsy or even more so  ,  the new book room full of mirrors by charles cross .  the man ,  the magic ,  the truth ,  while very dramatic ,  is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject ,  not a biography or a reliable historical record .  unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available ,  their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned .ray rae goldmanarchivist/historianjames marshall hendrix foundatio
let me start by saying that i would have given this book zero stars if i could .   the reviews i've read are all true .   this book is boring ,  extremely repetitive and a waste of time .   the only reason i finished it was because i paid for it .i truly believe that danielle steel has lost her gift of writing .   she has not published a good book in a long time .   i also think that she's lost her editor ,  because to me ,  a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed .this story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view .   there's the rich guy ,  charlie ,  who can't seem to find the  " perfect "  girl to marry .   he finds a flaw with every one he dates .   he lost his parents at a young age ,  his sister left school to raise him ,  and just before he graduated college ,  she died of a brain tumor .   so of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him .then there's rich adam ,  whose wife left him and took their two children with her .   it was a bitter divorce ,  so he has no desire to ever marry again .   he dates girls half his age and never stays with one long .   his parents blame him for the divorce .   every time he visits them ,  his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family .the last of the trio is gary ,  a struggling artist .   he has no desire to ever marry or date .the three men spend the month of august each year on charlie's yacht ,  partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments .   well of course ,  each one meets someone ,  they start to date ,  they argue ,  they break up ,  they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after .   same old story .danielle steel should stop writing .   you can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on .   i for one will not read any more of her books ,  even a paperback ,  and i won't even bother renting them from the library .   i won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time .   there are better authors available and i'm going to read them
by arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of  " dignity "  and  " familiarity "  rather than sentience and feeling ,  fukuyama brings to mind the european colonists who considered africans no more than  " common beasts .  "  his philosophy ,  although argued in a tone that seems reasonable ,  is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist .  not reccomended :  readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics
i recently read this as part of a survey of childrens' literature about the medieval period .  let me say first ,  that the dialogue is completely modernized ,  with not even a complex word to redeem it .  i know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect ,  but please ,  our children are more sophisticated than that .  adam is self-involved ,  careless ,  and annoyingly stupid .  despite it's touted 320 pages ,  this could have been printed in 150 ,  and contained much the same material .  the only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of latin and old english ballads scattered throughout .  if you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times ,  with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability ,  have them read song of the gargoyle .  it's also about a boy who loses his father ,  and has to search for him ,  in the company of a dog-like being ,  but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash .  the boy is also a minstrel ,  of sorts ,  but he has more likable qualities than adam ,  as well as more adventures in less pages .  the ending is a happy one ,  but it involves a twist ,  which isn't at all forseeable ,  as theat in adam of the road .  please ,  just skip this ,  i don't care if it won a newberry award ,  and read song of the gargoyle ,  by zylpha keatly snider
i've read only a few of hillerman's previous leaphorn/chee novels .  i've enjoyed what i've rtead ,  though they are an acquired taste ,  and i don't indulge in them very often .  i tend to enjoy the earlier ,  more active years of joe leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to jim chee' phase .from what i gather ,  'skeleton man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with hillerman's last few novels .  even without having read the books immediately prior to this one ,  i can understand that sentiment .'skeleton man' starts off with a rather risky premise ,  tying the story in with the real life collision over the grand canyon in 1956 .  while an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life' ( see nelson de mille's 'night fall' )  ,  hillerman fails here .the story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters ,  flimsy motivation ,  and very little that could really be called 'action' .chee ends up joining leaphorn in the background for much of the story .the spiritual and ritualistic aspects of hillerman's earlier books are ,  for the most part ,  glossed over here .  even what should have been a major plot development  ( chee's wedding )  is overshadowed by chee have to rescue manuelito ,  in the manner of far too many contrived 'superman rescues lois' situations .better to stick with hillerman's earlier novels .  the 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits hillerman ,  i'm afraid
this book is by far the worst proofed book i've ever read in my life .  i can't believe i'm writing this as a review ,  because i can normally overlook a few typos .  however ,  the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read .  i can't believe i paid money for it
i was recommended borges' works by one of his innumerable over-educated sycophants and i will never forget the tremendous time i wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life's work  ( when i should have been writing my dissertation )  .  each time i read one of his pedantic ,  mediocre peices of short fiction ,  i was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that i would like other examples of his work if i continued reading since &quot ; all of his stories are so unique . &quot ;  i found the exact opposite to be true .  one story after another about mazes ,  mirrors ,  mystical mathematical formulas and books ,  books ,  books .  the ideas were transperant ,  the language boring in the extreme .  his poetry is trite .  who needs this ?  borges reads like a petulant graduate student at university of chicago who failed repeatedly to get his/her short fiction published in _the atlantic monthly_ .  particularly among academics ,  literary elites and like people ,  many seem to cite borges and worship his genius more than read him--and certaintly _no one_ reads him critically .  i read most of his work ,  and i can tell you ,  outside of a few interesting turns of phrase ,  you'd be better off reading a yale dissertation on the semiotics of self-superiority .  people incessantly talk about how imaginative borges is .  the vast majority of popular sf and fantasy writers are more imaginative .  even many of the despicable magical realist &quot ; geniuses&quot ;  make borges look rather plain .  borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of manhattan or cambridge .  if you're this kind of pompous fellow ,  you'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of luis by your side and a series of mirrors ,  as it were ,  slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans-substantiation with this benighted old librarian .  if you're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters ,  enjoying nuanced use of language ,  and grasping subtle ,  daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter ,  run far ,  far away from jorge luis borges .  even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews .  the adulation of borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among  ( those who think themselves )  intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction .  i think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment ,  relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams ,  and not an example of literary genius .  in that sense ,  30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work ,  and that's about as much attention as he deserves
a rather toothless attempt at rewriting strunk and white ,  or chicago into &quot ; fun . &quot ;  reference books shouldn't waste this much space on casual conversation .  get to the point--get elements of style ,  elements of grammar ,  and chicago rather than this handbook
this is a fine series so when i began this volume i had hopes that it would be of the same standard as the others .   ms .  haney has a genuine gift in giving readers the  " texture "  of everyday life in imperial rome  ( at the time of vespasian and titus in this one )  .   the dialogue and the characters are both engaging .   so what went wrong ?   a young girl appears to speak with falco believing someone in her family wants to kill her .   and away we go ,  on and on and on !   i was weary by the time i got to the rather flat conclusion and felt that a good editing would have been most helpful ;  the length of this book  ( 326 pages )  really cannot support so thin a story .   i was left wondering what had happened and if somehow i had missed something as there was so little going on
oh ,  yes - this is a very fine book .  .  .  for me to poop on !in other words ,  it's a joke book .  it's just another one of a half dozen duds out there ,  all trying to slam whoever happens to be the #1 retailer at the time - this decade it's wal-mart .foreign countries paying their workers less ?  blame wal-mart !  worker insurance prices going sky high because the medical industry over-estimates it's fees ?  blame wal-mart !  crooked unions feeling threatened they'll get their butts kicked by non-union competition ?  blame wal-mart !  etc .  ,  etc .you just have to laugh at how these semi-journalistic schlockmeisters try so desperately to compare themselves to a real activist like micheal moore ,  who actually accomplishes some social good once in awhile .but you know who's really laughing ?  that's right - wal-mart .  that's because they've already built their thousands of stores ,  and been in business for over 40 years ,  so it's way too late now for these mealy-mouthed media wannabes to do anything about it !and what do these ersatz authors expect at this very late date ,  anyway ?  that millions of consumers ,  during these roller-coaster economic times ,  will be instantly brainwashed by these new crackpot books and then suddenly start to  " boycott lower prices "  ?  ha !  ha !  ha !like i said ,  this has got to be just another joke book
replicant alert !  avoid this book if you have any affection for the movie .  except for the last couple of pages ,  the author has little to offer other than the usual drivel about &quot ; post-modernism&quot ;  .  you will be much  better off buying the director's cut on dvd ,  and watching it several  times !    this series of books has its exceptions ,  this is not one of them .    unintentionally hilarious in parts ,  as only the academician can be .     pretentious ,  ponderous cinema-scholar jargon that offers little of value or  insight .    read sammon's the making of blade runner instead !    ( nice  cover ,  though .  .  .
i am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review .   however ,  after reading botox diaries ,  i felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull ,  trite ,  and disjointed .   i love my  " chick-lit "  books ,  but botox diaries is a disgrace to this genre .   the plot is weak and unrealistic  ( even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords  " lite & fun "  books )  .   the plot is also disjointed ,  perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book .   the characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull .   botox diaries is absolutely the worst book i have ever read .-- december 2005 update :   my friend insisted on reading this book  ( ugh .  .  . despite my warnings !  )  .  even though she was stuck in the airport for eight hours ,  she still couldn't bear to finish the book ,  because she found it so dull .  she actually left it ,  half-read ,  at the airport
i found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque ,  but because it so clearly illustrates how the french & italians got their reputations as great lovers .  is this the best that english literature can give us ?  this fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy ,  let alone female sexuality .it's also mean-spirited .  lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman ,  and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept .  this is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal .  he drips way too much contempt .everything outside of sex is dumb ,  meaningless ,  ridiculous .  attempting to derive enjoyment from the  " mental life "  makes one ridiculous ;  being paralyzed makes one ridiculous ;  trying to have sex in any way outside lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic ,  or defective ,  or spiteful ;  not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of  " woman "  or  " man "  ;  and so on .looking at italian art is stupid .  everything in paris is stupid .  constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in france knows how to have sex properly .reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's  " wrong "  with everyone except c .  and m .  ,  one might easily conclude that constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper ,  and hilda does seem happier in venice - the author counters this by ridiculing  " that kind "  of happiness as delusional and druglike .  he even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her .  of course constance is wretched ,  because she does not have that one thing that ,  in lawrence's view ,  really matters in life - not mellors ,  but mellors' equipment .  this book does degenerate into phallus-worship ,  which makes the author's hostility toward  " druglike "  pleasures seem sort of ironically comical .hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures :  from venice ,  from the feel of the sun ,  from jazz ,  from dancing .  this seems weird to me - as if lawrence is punishing the uppity woman .  hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a  " user "  ,  with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man ,  only to walk away when the dance is over .   ( this may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist ,  since obviously lawrence doesn't mind if mellors is callous and behaves as a  " user "  .  )it's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body .  everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex ,  but his notion of real sex .this is where astute readers will have the most trouble .  lawrence clearly defines a  " real "  woman - constance chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples .a woman who lays there  " unfeeling "  is clearly an example .  such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc .  lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related ;  it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs .  women who are defective not only physically ,  but in character .on the other hand ,  a woman with an unfeminine urge to be in control - that is ,  one who insists on moving herself ,  rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when michaelis is the male  ( because he's premature ,  and meant to be pathetic )  ,  but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially mellor's bertha ,  who just refused to come when she should out of spite .  bertha just had a sick  (  !  )  urge to be in control ,  demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature .  the only thing mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he  " spoilt "  her .as for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy ?  forget it .  lawrence suggests that mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch ,  but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental ,  nothing important .  a real woman doesn't need foreplay .  just hop on and go ,  and if she's what she ought to be ,  she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later .these were what i found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there ,  not too passive ,  but not too active ,  and come when she's supposed to  ( and if she doesn't ,  it's her own fault )  ;  while a man's job is to climb on top and  " perform "  .  all of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are ,  unfortunately ,  not true .  the truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis ;  there's a thing that both males and females start out with ,  which in a man becomes the penis ,  and in the woman becomes  ( or remains )  a clitoris .  lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part .women have always known about their own bodies ;  surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things ,  preferably apart from what women think men  " want to hear "  .  this ,  too ,  is no doubt why it has been accused of being  " sexist "  .  the author  ( or at least mellors )  openly blames women who cannot or will not  " come to the crisis "  when she ought ,  as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man .it's also likely that science will eventually prove  ( if it hasn't already )  that women like constance chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically .  for all that lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly ,  even noxious emotions and desires - such as  " intimacy "  and  " connection "  ,  both of which he has constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act ,  but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences ,  based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his dna out there ,  while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment .  if this is true ,  it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant ,  not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child .so - while there may or may not be women who feel as constance does ,  at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman  " should "  feel that way ,  as to justify lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance .there's a lot of talk of  " tenderness "  - in fact ,  constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in venice of somehow  " lacking tenderness "  - but quite frankly i am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender .  the only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her ,  but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find .i can imagine a woman putting up with - but i cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk ,  who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal  ( remembering she's a lady )  when she asks him questions ,  who calls her c--t as if that were her name ,  and generally treats her as if she were a whore .  i could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of ,  but this is how their relationship really is ;  she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible .for what it's worth ,  i think life will be better when this book has become obsolete .  it is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages ,  if not their selves .  those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion .  as for those who just want a good read - i'd call it a matter of personal taste .  obviously some people enjoy this book .   ( equally obviously ,  i did not .
pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers ,  whose very existence and relevance is due to that king .  what you will get from that kind of writing ?  noonan was a speechwriter reagan administration .  sound familiar ?  noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings .  probably she does not care .  americans are lucky that they never had any king .  noonan fails to provide any inside information how reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - aids ,  iran-contra ,  welfare ,  deficits ,  funding mujahideens ,  cozy relationship with saddam .  instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler ,  happy citizens .  .  .  " happily lived ever after "  .  basically ,  this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer .   her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already .  this is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's  ( which is nothing new in human civilizations )  .  secondly ,  she fails to understand that reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working americans .  but she gives all the credits to reagan ,  except all the negative things ,  like iran-contra .  in the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings ,  characters of kings and the writings about them
it was mark twain who popularized the aphorism of benjamin disraeli that there are three kinds of lies :  lies ,  damned lies ,  and statistics .   i kept hearing all these marvelous things about freakonomics ,  a book by steven levitt and stephen dubner ,  so when i ran across it at 25% off ,  i did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it .   i thought ,  what the freak ,  i've got a pretty inquisitive mind and i'm open to seeing things differently ,  to discovering new viewpoints .the doubt started early when i got the book home and i first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of time ,  the new york times ,  the washington post ,  and the los angeles times .   when all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is ,  i'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious .   author malcolm gladwell tells us on the cover ,   " prepare to be dazzled .  "   well ,  evidently ol' malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than i am .    ( i won't even mention the smug mug of stephen dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because i don't want you to get the idea that i judge a book by its cover .   or in this case ,  a writer by his physiognomy .   so i won't mention that .  )if you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home ,  then you just might be dazzled by freakonomics .   if i tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts ,  thinking that it is cutting costs ,  is probably increasing its overhead ,  and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask  " but how ?  "  - then yes ,  buy freakonomics and be dazzled .   mostly what freakonomics offers  ( when its conclusions can be trusted )  is just what we used to call  " common sense .  "   but since america has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent ,  brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of survivors ,  and american idols ,  and lost knuckleheads ,  good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead  ( when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands ,  that is )  .i dove into freakonomics hoping to find my purchase worthwhile .   i got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized :  everything would require second-guessing and verifying .   on that page ,  smug mug tells us  ( based on a single report by the institute of medicine )  that  " drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health .  "   fortunately ,  i read your body's many cries for water by doctor f .  batmanghelidj over a decade ago so i already knew what a bunch of bunk that was .in chapter 4 ,  smug mug  " proves "  that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the roe v .  wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate .   this represents the centerpiece of his book ,  both literally and ideologically .   the first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s .   on page 92 ,  the author acknowledges that the police in atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 olympics .   well ,  would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted ?   true ,  being honest might be means to an increased budget ,  but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control .   and surely the chamber of commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception .   let me ask ,  do you actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s ?   that's funny ,  me neither .   there's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported ,  and recently ,  an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now .in dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime  ( if this claim is a verity )  ,  dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop .   having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian ,  it's funny that i find myself even contending with the stats smug mug uses that actually work against his theory :  i believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly .   and dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws  " simply don't bring down crime .  "    ( be sure to read the utterly fascinating book ,  gunfighters ,  highwaymen & vigilantes by roger d .  mcgrath ,  for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint !  )in dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion ,  i didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s ,  and i wonder if that might have some statistical bearing .   ya think ?    yes ,  i think smug mug is selective .   he calls some abortions a  " crude and drastic sort of insurance policy .  "   not  " immoral .  "   not  " sinful .  "   but then i didn't expect smug mug to call a sin a sin .and even if levitt and dubner's hypothesis is correct ,  that abortions have lowered crime ,  the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person ,  but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered .   so why are we even discussing this ?   i'll tell you why :  because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus ,  and now they're pulling out all the stops ,  trying to  " statistically "  convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing .   i find this repulsive !    ( and there are studies indicating that those missing people have ,  and will continue to have ,  a negative economic impact on society .  )i won't even go into chapter 5 ,  what makes a perfect parent ?   suffice to say that as usual  ( surprise !  surprise !  )  all the statistics dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue .   funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs .   just know that if you're a working mother ,  you haven't cheated your child in the least ,  but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order ,  you are  " unenlightened .  "   if your kid is watching lots of tv ,  it isn't turning the  " child's brain to mush .  "    ( no word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though .  )   and the studies  ( that we are called to pay attention to )  show  " that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care ,  whether he had one parent or two ,  whether his mother worked or didn't ,  whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each .  "    ( i've often wondered what might have happened to me if my mom ,  who was home most of the time ,  hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day ,  year after year ,  while i was growing up in the `60s and `70s .  )i've given freakonomics two stars because i did find the section on the naming of children very interesting ,  as well as the story of stetson kennedy's fight against the  " three ks .  "   but if you're smarter than i am ,  you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it .   economically speaking ,  that's just  " common cents .  "
as someone very interested in urban exploration  ( especially in the subways )  i wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it .  after reading many of these amazon reviews though ,  i opted out of a purchase ,  and took it out of my bronx library instead .  thank goodness as i only wasted valuable time ,  and not any money .this book is a sham .  it is obviously mostly fiction .  and it's boring fiction at that .  the book is divided into chapters ,  each chapter a new  " adventure .  "i read the subway one first ,  where the  " explorers "  take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line ,  to see the city hall station ,  which opened in 1904  ( nyc's first station )  and closed in 1948 .  the station is located on the loop of the 6 train ,  that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop ,  brooklyn bridge .  first of all ,  anyone can go on this  " adventure .  "  just stay on the train at the last stop ,  brooklyn bridge ,  and that's it .  despite the author's attempt to make this sound risky ,  no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on  ( like they really care )  ,  just sit down .  the author created some  " european tourists "  that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop ,  and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying  " are we on the wrong train ?  "  well ,  unless all those huge  " 6 "  signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read ,  then you probably got on the correct train .  the author also fails to mention that the mta used to give public tours all the time through this station  ( and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more )  but stopped after 9-11 .  this chapter was a joke .i started reading the other chapters ,  and saw they were no better .  i then started to breeze through the book .  one thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all .  this ,  despite the fact that on page 67 the author states ,   " josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle .  .  .  "   but no photos of their  " adventures "  are in the book .  why ?  because it's fiction .there are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring ,  sure ,  that's easy .  there's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere ,  ooo .  buit no pics of the actual  " adventures .  "  i guess  " josh "  lost all those pictures when he went to cvs to have them developed .the funny thing is ,  you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself .  especially the city hall station ,  there are tons of pictures of it available from the people that were in there during the tours .just stay away from this sham of a book ,  it's really a huge waste of time
i can't remember the last time i failed to finish reading a novel .   i abandoned this one with 100 pages to go .   with another implausible plot twist ,  i've had enough .maybe i've been spoiled by the quality of character driven fiction from george pelecanos ,  james lee burke ,  robert b parker ,  james sallis ,  scott phillips ,  and robert crais but i suspect that this is not just a failure to connect with the characters and more to do with poor writing .i've read quite a number of deaver's novels and enjoyed the complex plots and the exploration of psychologically/psyciatrically devient chbaracters ,  but this is just over the top .   when i came to the chapter that excplained how the magician faked his death while in custody ,  that was enough .i have another fifty novels lined up waiting to be read and i'll be damned if i'm going to waste any more time on this poor one .   for that matter ,  after six or so lincoln rhyme novels ,  i can't say that i really know or care anything about lincoln or saches
" the number "  poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers .  a four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom ,  even if it is a number .  eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down ,  or twenty-five times .  .  .  .  well ,  there's the rub ,  twenty-five times what ?  income ?  expenses ?  income less savings ?  projected discretionary spending ?  post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses ?  the proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants ,  experts ,  philosophers ,  and casual acquaintances .  eisenberg ,  a former esquire editor and short-timer with lands end ,  ruminates about a simple question :  how much money do you need to feel secure ?  the problem is that security comes in multiple forms :  happiness ,  comfort ,  excess consumption ,  ego .  and the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be .  constructing a one-year budget is hard enough .  constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible .eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses .  doctors ,  divorcees ,  `downshifters' ,  and very little real data shed little light on the real issues .  maybe i knew too much going in .  maybe i expected too much from a few positive references from other sources .  in the middle i was confused .  by the end i was simply disappointed .  and i have my own number ,  and it changes every day
i did not like the book .   it did have some interesting points to consider ,  but it did not seem like discipline to me .   i am more of a love and logic fan .   i think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior  ( or don't care )  until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them ,  which this book says not to do .   i just don't agree with it
from the remarks at this site ,  people either love this novel or hate it .  i hated it .  i hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about mfa program writing in the last 30 years .  the emphasis is entirely on style .  forget story .  forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative .  just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere .  some of this thinking goes back to henry james ,  some of it goes back to virginia woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits  ( like h . g .  wells' the time machine )  .  the first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom frank bascombe is trying to sell a property .  it's brilliantly written .  in fact ,  it's so brilliantly written that i had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life ,  his loves ,  and the region of the country he inhabits .  this book has no driving plot .  in fact ,  it's an arbitrarily chosen conceit :  what happens on july 4th in the life of one guy .  it's not james joyce's ulysses nor is it trying to be ,  but every thought this man has is in this book .  and none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person--any perso--should pick up the book .indeed ,  that seems to be the crux .  i read this book because it was by richard ford ,  a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere .  you must read this book ,  they said .  so i did .  and i consider it an extraordinary waste of my time .  to be sure ,  this is a judgment call ,  but i'm allowed to make it .  every reader is allowed to make that call .  but i know i'm in the minority in this .  this book is supposed to be one of the greatest american novels of the last 25 years .  but will it be so in another 25 years ?  are novels now only to be interior monologues  ( which virginia woolf preferred and said so in her essay  " modern fiction "  )  ?perhaps our values are changing .  perhaps the mfa programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story .  but what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism ,  wherein the author writes at length ,  putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we're supposed to  .   .   .  what ?  applaud it ?i believe that the authors we'll remember will be the natural storytellers .  i don't think richard ford is one of them .  but ,  man ,  he sure can write
i wanted to like this book .   it's a great size for carrying around to dip into .   however ,  i'd say about a third ,  or maybe more ,  i haven't counted ,  are anonymous .  here's an example :   " life is filled with possibilities "  p31 .   now i don't know about you ,  but i'd hardly class that as great stuff from great minds .  then i read  " decide what is worthwhile and follow through with it "  and i'm beginning to yawn .  when i came to  " above all ,  life should be fun "  and  " always keep a window open in your mind for new ideas "  and i'm just about ready to throw the book into the garbage .   also ,  the format of the book is terrible .   someone decided to put every quote into a little frame ,  so you get four quotes on a page .still ,  for the price ,  it's not that bad .   no ,  on second thoughts it's pretty dire .   there's just too many pathetic jingles in here for me ,  which only motivate me to demand a refund !   if i were you ,  i'd save my money and put it towards something else -  " the book of positive quotations "  has 7000 quotes and i wouldn't be without my copy
robin williams used to tell a joke about his son ,  saying that whenever he got angry with him his son would say 'you hit me and i'll write a book . ' i'd like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind peggy salinger's memior about life with her father ,  but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea .  although there are some interesting revelations about salinger as a man ,  his daughter doesn't seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of jd salinger ,  they're the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday .  there's a lot of blame thrown around here ,  and not a whole lot of admitting to one's own mistakes .  although this is probably to be expected ,  it's still frustrating ,  since margaret salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her father's good name ,  and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical .   ( complaining about your father's desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea .  )  i admit that her father is probably not as nice a guy as you think he would be ,  but this is not really a revelation ,  nor should it affect your feelings about his work .  i wouldn't recommend reading it unless your working on a thesis of some sort
the case for marriage makes arguments supportive of pres .  bush's policies on marriage .  however ,  howard kurtz of the washington post  ( 1/26/5 )  reports that maggie gallagher was paid over $40 , 000 by the bush administration to write columns and a  " private "  report supporting its $300 million hhs marriage initiative .mr .  kurtz reports that ms .  gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers ,  writing  " i should have disclosed a government contract when i later wrote about the bush marriage initiative .  i would have ,  if i had remembered it .  "  she also states she was  " aware vaguely "  that her work was federally funded .  it must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40 , 000 .  bad memory ,  vagueness ,  national column :  what will we say to the children ?i wonder who paid ms .  gallagher to write this book
what a bunch of high school hallway gossip !  the author does not know the difference between white and albino !  the 'genetics' discussions on color  ( which includes people ,  chickens ,  horses ,  and dogs - all of it suspect )  and mutts vs .  purebred dogs are total claptrap !  i confess ,  i couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies . ' what ?  ?  a waste of my hard-earned $ .  having read those parts i cannot believe anything that went before or that follows ,  not that i'm reading any further .  how is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print ?  and now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation .  publisher ,  where are your pre-publication reviews ?  shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published !
i found this book extremely verbose and unorganized .   it would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student .   but it's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class .   the authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student .   not recommended
i had read such glowing reviews of this book ,  and had enjoyed other creamer works so thoroughly that i was suprised how uninspired i was while reading this .  perhaps i failed to be dazzled by stengel the man .  perhaps i grew tired of the predictable retelling of stengel's life ,  season by  season ,  many of which held no remarkable events .  baseball in '41 is a much  more rewarding book ,  full of wonderful anecdotes well recounted
i was really disappointed with this book .   a lot of the recipes are identical to one another ,  with just one ingredient - eg a different type of vegetable - substituted .   with no pictures and not much more content ,  i really regret buying it .
yes ,  it was intended as a  " fun "  read  ( literature of the absurd ?  )  and it did evoke several chuckles ,  especially at the first .   but as literature  ( read into that word what you will )  it's an abysmal failure .  crammed with so many jokes ,  puns ,  outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action ,  one's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices .  it's a case where you can't see the forest for all the intervening trees .i had expected a  " straight "  tale similar to the alienist .   then when i discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural i perked up .   it was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that i grew weary of the whole thing .   toward the end it descended into caricature .   what's sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to snl and the visual media .   in fact ,  the book seemed very visual ,  almost as if the author were transcribing a snl skit
the kite runner gets off to such a good start ,  with its blend of history ,  observations about daily life in kaboul ,  and a compelling story of two boys growing up together .  the second half goes badly astray ,  as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental .  by the end of the book ,  the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation .  i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up ,  stay focused ,  and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand
i have enjoyed the miss julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite .miss julia is married to sam murdoch .  poor guy is sent to find the missing hazel marie in one part and is gone for a good deal of the story .  miss julia does not even make a case of those missing hours !  it is as if the author could really care less .there are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this woman's life .  there are times when miss julia seems to self-centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here .  i found her less likable and also less believable .  she has taken in her husband's mistress ad illegitimate child .  now ,  there is a question about the child's paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing !  !  !  !  !perhaps other books in the series would be a better intro for the uninitiated
why ?  because i was expectin something else ,  but first of all ,  i didn't expect that you have to open/make a hole in your robosapiens to modify it ,  so forget it !  i will not damage my robot
if you want a very simple will or a very simple living will or power of attorney for health care ,  this program will work for you .  however ,  it offers only a very narrow range of options for personalizing the generic forms included in the package .  i disliked this program so much that i threw the whole package in the trash .
i found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics ,  with no insights .   since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors ,  and it's only 200  pages in a fairly large typeface ,  i wasn't expecting historical depth .   but  i was expecting at least one fresh idea .   i bought it on the strength of a  much earlier book by nathan rosenberg  ( about technology in the economy of  the 19th century )  .   i was disappointed .   i get the feeling the book is  intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower  -- college freshmen born in the 1980s .   i'll bet they find it kinda stodgy
i am pretty sure that the author sent the only positive review .   that is pretty pathetic .   this book was written with no rhyme or reason .   there is no good progression of information or understandable sense to it all .   one  star is stretch .   plus ,  i am asian ,  and it was still hard for me-that is  when you know it is bad
hi ,i have used this book among others to get accepted to mckinsey  ( and with success )  and i think this book gave me less then others .the advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter ,  but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous ( like for example the case in which a star-trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented ,  and the book claims that it wouldn't replace cars because it costs 100 , 000$ .  come on ,  they would buy one for every block )  .i think there are much better resources than this .good luck with your interviews
having read clive cussler adventures for over 10 years ,  i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book .  the father ,  who does not stay with his son ,  decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country .  that is perfectly justified !the book mentions hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one .  this is a direct insult to all hindus as being one i am astonished at the insensitivity of the author .  how come  " hickman "  is not a  " christian "  mercenary or for that matter the corporation as they seem to be in this for the money .  the justifications are ridiculous .  india and hindus of india have been terrorized ,  jailed ,  colonized and robbed by christian and muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years .  you don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country .  we have grown spiritually to accept everyone ,  and i would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books .  the book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs
eve dallas is a cop in the future ,  chasing drug dealers ,  killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general .  her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of eve's rich husband and ends up dead . i hated this book ,  the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags
much of this book is very one sided .   in particular the sections on the environment are distorted and now known to be incorrect .   the book would be much better if they had not shown their bias
i am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book .   honestly ,  it was a complete waste of my time .   to quote a friend ,  it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar .   if you are a fan of pedestrian writing ,  lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development ,  this is your book
the number of books written in our society is huge and getting huger .  everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read .  why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market ?  one reason ,  apparently embraced by the goldstones ,  is that it is so easy to write a book !  all you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences .  they don't have to be particularly interesting experiences .  you don't have to do any research into your subject .  if you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing ,  if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took ,  if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers  ( even if they are not interesting or witty )  ,  and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in ,  you can finish the book in a couple of weekends !  and readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done .the book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors ,  and i recognized some of my own experiences in the stories the authors tell .  however ,  the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over common early errors ,  nor does it attempt to answer many of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting .  what determines the price of old books ?  why are first editions important ?  why should tarzan books cost more than great works of literature ?  these are good questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting ,  and you will find the questions but not the answers here .the book is written in a breezy style that is easy to get through ,  and if you have two hours at an airport to kill ,  you could do worse than to read it .  but by the time you arrive at your destination ,  you will have likely forgotten most of what you just read ,  because so much of it is ephemeral details of the authors' own lives ,  transportation problems ,  and experiences .  if you are really interested in book collecting ,  it would be wise to read one of the many books that describe what one should look for ,  how prices are determined ,  different styles of book collecting ,  and so on .  fragments of this knowledge are transmitted in this book ,  but they will leave you with more questions than answers .to be sure ,  not every book about book collecting needs to be a font of wisdom .  but the entertainment value of the authors' experiences was weak ,  and did not make up for the absence of useful content
this was the first book by daniel steel that i laid my hands on .  .  .  . really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers .  there are so many open ends in the story .  .  . chartacters are not distinctly outlined .  .  . tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
when i picked up this book i had high expectations , seeing that it had received good reviews . it opened quite spectacularly as well ,  on a rather surreal note . but as i read on ,  i couldn't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent ,  rambling tale . the book seemed like a sloppy ,  haphazard collection of incidents that didn't make much sense or assist character development .  the central character herself was unbelievable and i found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights . it seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip , cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky .  some incidents were quite mirth-provoking ,  however , that's why i gave it two stars
woolf's style of writing  ( changing between several characters' thoughts )  causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio .  the paperback proved to be easier for me .
dr .  freeman's justly esteemed  " lee's lieutenants "  -- a three volume work -- still stands  ( despite the discovery of materials unavailable to dr .  freeman when he first wrote in the 1930s and 40s )  as the baseline for any study of the army of northern virginia .   the cheap attempt by a modern publisher to squeeze a few cents out of the franchise ,  offered here ,  throws out two of every three words dr .  freeman wrote to allow for a one-volume  " abridgement "  for those presumably too intimidated by the thought of reading three entire books .the three-volume work ,  as dr .  freeman wrote it ,  was reprinted fairly recently .   if that is no longer available on amazon ,  any decent sized used book store will have it in stock .whatever you do ,  avoid this butchered ,  one volume version like the plague
i'm surprised that someone so seemingly intelligent does not know that stories and specific examples are what make a book interesting .  this book was totally devoid of them ,  but instead used vague generalizations from beginning to end .  i read the whole book and was waiting for it to get good .  it never did .  don't waste your time or your money .  any positive review must have been written by the author's friends .  i would rather eat cardboard that read this book again .
i read a good short story by franzen in the new yorker a couple years ago ,  but this book is lame ,  lame ,  lame .   the essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy ,  boring opinions on various subjects .   imagine if you can a duller ,  less-relavant andy rooney .   if i wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings ,  i would get on the internet and start reading weblogs .   i hereby declare this book unreadable
i like looking at old pictures and old letters ,  but i thought when i bought the book that i would actually be looking in the history of someone's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case .   it is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book .   the pictures aren't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters ,  so you know nothing of the authors ,  no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything .   in other words ,  no story behind it whatsoever .   just a disappointing collection
racism is not the problem with this book - sure .  .  . 5 chinese brothers look alike -maybe they look alike because they are brothers ,  not because they are chinese .   i bought this book because generally i love the books written in earlier times - they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time .   this book does have engaging illustrations .   what i find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet :( 1 ) 	a little boy drowns ,  never to be seen again( 2 ) 	one brother is tried ,  arrested and sentenced to have his head cut off( 3 ) 	the people of the village assemble in the village to witness the execution where the  " executioner took his sword and struck a mighty blow "( 4 ) 	the next brother was sentenced to be drowned and was thrown overboard from a boat( 5 ) 	the next brother is sentenced to be burned alive - he was tied up to a stake and set fire( 6 ) 	the next brother is sentenced to be suffocated - he's shovelled into an oventhis is no more appropriate for a child  ( or adult for that matter )  in 1936 than it is in 2005 .   now ,  a lot of you are probably thinking i'm one of those mothers who just needs to get a sense of humour and lighten up .   i'm not .  .  . i love the giving tree ,  and can put naughty eloise  ( and the smoking nanny )  in context ,  as i can many other books that polarise readers .   i really wanted to like this book but trust me .  .  .  . if you buy it ,  you will have lots of uncomfortable explaining to do to a young child .   an eight year old may be able to put it in context ,  but there is no way you should read this to a four year old .    if you want a great book written in the 1930s ,  buy ferdinand the bull instead .   it's a fantastic book .
very disappointed with it .  was expecting something groundbreaking ,  but it failed to deliever .  an easy read and quite honestly ,  boring .don't waste your time .  read something more worthwile like robert anton wilson .
i was disappointed greatly at the time i opened this book .  huge gaps between strings ,  lots of empty space on pages - all this is for masking the simple fact :  this  " 200 pages book "  contents could be easily printed on 80 pages or even less .  and ,  more ,  these pages are filled with useless  " interviews "   ( who wants to read an interview instead of explanations ?  !  )  and other empty words .the book is supposed to teach us how to make modules for nwn 2 .  but it doesn't .  see ,  the chapter about scripts consists of 4 pages - is it really enough for such a great theme ?   ( these pages ,  i mentioned it already ,  are less than 2 pages .  .  .  )  .this book is better than nothing .  a bit .  because some useful information it provides .  and that's all good that could be said about it
the author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing ,  the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery .i find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as bag of bones and the stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner .  fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict .  a body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body .  we learn the man was from colorado but very little else .if the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened .  i would recommend a mary higgins clark mystery in place of this boo
i couldn't read past the second chapter .   roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims .   it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of  " the bitter "  .    " your wives are your fields ,  so go to your fields as you like "  isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran .   i'm not going to finish this book ,  because i'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic ,  oppressed  " other "  type of woman ,  thanks .
earlier this year i reviewed what many will see as the companion volume to this book  (  " photoshop blending modes cookbook for digital photographers "  )  ,  written by the same author .  unfortunately ,  the newer publication is less useful .  it seems to have been written on a pretext that it's clever to be able to duplicate what traditional artists can do .  this seems - from my own personal viewpoint - to be greatly undervaluing the power of photoshop  ( and similar software )  .  practitioners of digital fine art should  ( really ,  constructively )  be looking to explore what the principles of prior and traditional art can mean within a new domain .plus ,  the book gets off to a definitely poor start .  the second and longer of two introductory sections is titled  " the tricks of the trade "  .  well it would be better if just some of the  " tricks "  had been explained in full and more accurately .   say ,  how to make a selection in photoshop from the best available precursor  ( a black-and-white alpha channel )  .  or say again ,  how to make tonal corrections to the original photograph using a luminance mask .  then again ,  the first  ( and shorter )  of the introductory chapters ,  titled  " the artist's eye "  ,  is just a teaser .  this topic - pre-visualizing what can be achieved as an output image when composing the original photographic input - could have benefited from a much more detailed explanation/argument .  indeed ,  it could even merit an expansive concluding chapter  ( but the book doesn't have one of those at all  .  .  .  .  )  .  this is ,  after all ,  at the very core of what the user could harness to any given artistic objective .additionally ,  i think that it's strange that a book such as this simply makes no reference at all to what could be printed from the recipes it contains .  some of the finished  ( output )  images might look quite intriguing as 3 by 5 inch reproductions in the book - but does the methodology hold up if you're targeting a 20 by 36 inch output  ( say )  on a large format printer ?  and what to do if that's not the case ?  finally ,  and in common with the earlier companion volume ,  this book suffers from strange and inconsistent layouts of screenshots and text ,  plus all sorts of technical and editing omissions/errors  ( which include ,  for example ,  having the wrong screenshot in the wrong recipe - see p . 108 )
i have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title .   as others have pointed out ,  coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times .   this could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw .   alas it is not .   the writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting .   the language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus .   again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account ,  not that of an english grad student .this book offers a stark contrast in comparison with nathaniel fick's  " one bullet away .  "   whereas fick seems to be an intelligent ,  thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men ,  coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else .   he is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company .you cannot know a person from reading their writing but coughlin's character development is very superficial .   his attempts to convey a  " human side "  are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived .   this is a great contrast to the character development in  " one bullet .  "   there is no connection between author and reader in  " shooter .  "   coughlin does not develop the role players either .   in  " one bullet "  you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer ,  his ncos and the enlisted men .   additionally ,  coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff  ( non-trigger pullers )  is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic .to make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles .   the author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits ,  with plenty of after-action chest thumping ,  obscures the view of battle .   he spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft ,  training and shooting .   this can be found elsewhere .overall this book was a great disappointment .   if only a fraction of coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true ,  then he is a remarkable sniper .   he should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them
i've been a fan of heinlein's sf for just about as long as i've been an sf fan at all  ( somewhere around thirty-five years )  .  but when i read this collection some twenty-odd years ago ,  it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether .the fiction is pretty good  ( although even that isn't heinlein's best )  .  but to describe the nonfiction accurately ,  i'd have to use words that amazon will remove from the review anyway .for the most part ,  the pieces collected here represent a side of heinlein i strongly dislike .  though i respect _starship troopers_ ,  it's never going to be my favorite heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of  " fascism "  -- and i'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection .and mind you ,  it's not because i disagree with heinlein's opinions ;  it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed .  some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic .   ( at least in his fiction ,  he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short ,  to grok them .  not here ,  boy .  )heinlein  ( who bought into the korzybski/general semantics fad pretty early on )  spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions .  but his own attempt at philosophy ,  as represented here in e . g .   " the pragmatics of patriotism "  ,  is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy i've ever seen .then ,  too ,  people who knew heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor ,  he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him .  well ,  he's certainly unpleasant here ;  anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head .  even in the unlikely event that i thought he were _right_ ,  i wouldn't find this a very helpful approach .perhaps more surprisingly ,  his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good .  asimov's reputation as the  " great explainer "  is in no danger here .this volume is second only to _grumbles from the grave_ in cementing heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was .  when i want heinleinian company ,  i'll stick to d . b .  davis ,  manuel garcia o'kelly davis ,  and  ( maybe )  lazarus long .and when i want to read some humane nonfiction by an sf master ,  i'll still turn to asimov .  i credit heinlein with three magisterial novels ,  several imperfect-but-great ones ,  and a good number of brilliant short stories .  but the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer
after reading the first book * ( which was catastropha )  and reading the second which was really good ,  i thought that the series is taking off ,  i was mistaken ,  the third book is slow ,  and boring ,  you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that seriesnothing much is happening ,  and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas ,  the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find  ( and better written as well )  in dragon lance series ,  or other adventure books ,  also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books ,reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book ,  which some say is very boringi guess this is where the adventure end for me .  .
the very first thing you read in this book is a mistake .   the prologue begins with a photo of german pows at the end of wwi .   the photo caption states that the german army at the end of wwi was  " unbroken "  and implies that germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership .   this is doubly misleading .   the german army was soundly defeated on western front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate .   in 1918 ,  germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by ludendorff and hindenberg .   the political leaders who lost will were the german high command .   defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army .   keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious  " stab in the back "  myth used by the german military and right wing propagandists to undermine the weimar republic .   its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters .this type of error recurs throughout this book .   my favorite relatively minor error is keegan moving the ploesti oilfields ,  a major strategic resource ,  from romania to hungary .   see prior reader reviews for documentation of a number of factual errors of varying magnitude .   just as important and in some cases even more important are keegan's failures to discuss crucial aspects of wwii .   he makes little effort ,  for example ,  to discuss the origins of the war .   indeed ,  his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss .   leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this crucial topic ,  there are excellent overviews of 20s and 30s that are good guides to this admittedly formidable topic .   instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war ,  we get a superficial and somewhat misleading discussion of how industrialization transformed military technology and organization .   instead of a discussion of the sad history of the weimar republic ,  crucial for understanding the ascent of the nazis ,  we get another misleading discussion of the freikorps phenomenon .   among other significant omissions are his failure to grapple with the possible strategic significance of the allied bombing campaign against germany ,  a issue analyzed insightfully by richard overy in 2 of his excellent books .   keegan's discussion of the holocaust in both inadequate and implicitly misleading .   partly because he doesn't discuss the origins of the war and the role played by nazi ideology in starting the war he fails to show that in crucial respects the holocaust was the point of german aggression .   the nazis went to war not just to overturn the versailles settlement or even to conquer eastern europe ,  but to impose their bizarre notions of racial conflict on the rest of europe .   without this background ,  its impossible to understand the outbreak and the specific nature of wwii .   among other things ,  nazi racism prevented them from rationally exploiting the resources of the western soviet union ,  a factor in their eventual defeat .   as pointed out by other reviewers ,  keegan devotes a disproportionate amount of the book to activities of the western allies when the eastern front was really the crucial theatre .to be fair to keegan ,  writing a concise 1 volume book like this is very difficult .   the best 1 volume work on wwii is gerhard weinberg's book ,  which is about 1000 pages of text in a fairly small font .   some of the individual sections of this book are quite good and keegan has a nice ,  sometimes actually elegant ,  writing style .   none of these positive features ,  however ,  can overcome his neglect of basic features of wwii and the lack of attention to basic facts .   this is not just error ,  this is actual negligence .
compared to his other superb books ,  this is one is tedious and boring .   the overall thesis is a stretch - trying to find equivalences between pre-industrial  ( and pre-printing press )  13th century price paterns and those of the industrialized and post-industrial 20th century requires ignoring far to many factors .   at a minimum comparing a world in which 90% of the population are attached to agricultural production and illiterate to world where almost precicly the reverse holds is just too big a leap to swallow .sadly ,  one suspects more than a little political axe-grinding is involved .enjoy fischer's other books where he excells ,  but you won't miss much if you neglect to read the great wave .   besides ,  the subject has been better treated elsewhere by authors not so obviously out of their depth
of the thousands of books i've read in my life ,  and the hundreds i've actually purchased from amazon . com ,  this is the first time i've felt strongly enough about a book to write any sort of review .i kept waiting for the author to get to the point .   he rambled and meandered and didn't tell me anything new whatsoever .   he used the words  " alchemy "  and  " alchemists "  in almost every single paragraph of the book .skip this book - you'll get much more out of the  " cosmic trigger "  series ,   " quantum psychology "  ,  or  " prometheus rising "  by r . a .  wilson .
sometimes i've enjoyed books by david baldacci  ( wish you welland the winner come to mind )  ;  others ,  such as the last manstanding did little for me  .   .   .  add split second ,  which i justheard ,  to that latter list  .   .   .  it was a disappointing mystery thrillerabout two disgraced secret service agents who come together tosolve two campaign-trail crimes  .   .   .  i cared little about any of thecharacters ,  and there were far too many subplots floating aroundfor my taste  .   .   .  the ending also didn't do much for me ,  as it broughttoo many separate threads together in too quick a fashion  .   .   .  lastly ,i did not particularly  " buy "  the man behind the crimes ;  he just wasn'tall that believable .
galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure .   his ideas are sound ,  though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery .   in fact ,  his verbosity and poor structure is so bad ,  that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience .   the book really needs to go back to an editor
while this book put together by the detroit free press has action photos ,  they are some of the most disappointing pictures i've ever seen in a book about a team's season .  where are the photos of tiger players actually hitting a baseball ?  if you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne ,  talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles ,  then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself ,  be prepared to be frustrated .  i much preferred the photograhy in the george cantor paperback  " out of nowhere "  the detroit tigers' magical 2006 season .  i know that this volume covers the play-offs and world series whereas the cantor book doesn't ,  but it's photo collection is poor ,  the photos in the cantor book are superb .  if you are a tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much ,   ( the writing and articles are quite good at least ) but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc .  very disappointing ,  worth only 2 stars
owen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk .   he comes off as arrogant ,  showing little empathy towards debra's problems earlier on in their marriage  (  eating disorder ,  depression ,  social anxiety )  .   he writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble debra was in ,  but instead are very embarrassing to her .   he comes across as a husband with no compassion .   it's ironic that he goes on and on about debra's poor choices in boyfriends over the years ,  and how they were always so controlling of her .  .  .  . and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and debra didn't keep the house tidy .  .  . and he didn't approve of the way she dressed !  !   seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated .   he repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is ,  his gpa ,  jobs ,  earning potential ,  etc .  .  . but then admits that when they separated ,  he sticks debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off !   he says it was in her name ,  so she can have it !   owen shows how little a man he really is in this book .  debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid ,  and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart ,  she wouldn't have gone down the road she did .   i feel very sorry for debra after reading this book
paul auster's city of glass is perhaps the worst read i've experienced .   the story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious ;  the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself ;  we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--i kid you not .   the best part of this novel is the end .   i read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid ;  however ,  i was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams .   to all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical ,  existential tour de-force ,  i beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ .   i believe the author had no such thoughts in mind ,  had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining ,  dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices ,  gather such literary praise .   like a rorschach image you can see life ,  love ,  death ,  a myriad of wonderful symbols ,  and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth ,  intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life ,  well ,  then ,  good for you .   but in reality ,  the person that made that rorschach for you is auster ,  and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you all bought it .  .  . hook line and sinker .  this novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere ,  show us little on the way and still receive praise ,  despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work ,  in that it plain and simply :  sucks
design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story .   the translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex
unfortunately ,  instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis ,  justifications ,  and problems with overarching property rights ,  delong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists .   delong covers some of the same ground as congressman richard pombo in his 1996 this land is our land ,  simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions .   delong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded .   delong's politics overcome his analysis .   this book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions .    (  .  .  .  )   his political agenda overwhelm his rational
i'm thankful that i was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15 . 00 buying it .   i own the blue day book by the same author and i think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away .   he should have stopped with that book .  it claims to be a witty ,  thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way .   the only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures .   it did have one thought that i really liked :   &quot ; some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge .   if that's true ,  then why do smart people dress so badly ? &quot
if you walk into b&n and flip through  ( not even buy !  )  the other  " well known/recommended "  pregnancy books you'll get much more information than what douglas offers .if you're lazy/want a quick read ,  this book is for you .if you're looking for a comprehensive tell-all  ( which the title and reviews lead you to believe )  ,  this is *not* the book for you .this was a total waste of money !  if i had know it was this bad i would have just used my money to buy diapers instead .
ann coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality .   to her there is no middle ground .     i am an educated ,  well travelled adult who while born in the united states ,  spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded .   to be called a communist ,  a traitor ,  and an enemy of america just because i don't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on .i have never in my life considered buring or destroying a book because of it's evil ,  until i read this one .be afraid ,  be very afraid of these people
i am a nevada barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with  " high country .  "   the story takes place in a restaurant  ( boring )  .  the characters were dull and i kept getting them confused .  anna's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome .  i also missed anna's sister ,  molly ,  who is only mentioned a few times in the book .sorry ,  but i really can't recommend this book as a good read .  if you want to get a feel for a real anna pigeon adventure ,  pick up  " track of the cat "  or  " liberty falling .
have you ever done something wrong but justified it so that you wouldn't feel bad ?   have you ever seen someone else do the exact same wrong thing and condemn him ?  in this story ,  the main character seems to believe that even when he does bad things he's still a  " good guy "  because  " good guys "  don't do bad things .   dizzing logic ,  huh ?   throughout the novel ,  you review his senior year of high school with him .   it starts out with the story of how he got the nickname  " killer "  to why it's okay for him to take illegal drugs or break a public statue .   the flashbacks of the past year are woven within the present day drama of him trying to convince a scared and angry young woman that he didn't rape her .   he won't let her leave the room until she believes it .   the ending is less than satisfactory for me .   i would much rather the main character have received retribution and the girl receive justice
i have read all of the scarpetta novels through the last precinct ,  and i have never wanted hours of my life back as i did when i finished the last precinct .cornwell tried to go in a new direction with her writing ,  and it failed .  if kay scarpetta was a fortune teller ,  this book may have been alright .  .  .what i mean by that is ,  in at least 2-3 separate occassions in this book ,  kay says  " i had a feeling i knew exactly what  [ so in so was going to say/do to me .  .  .  "really kay ?  out of absolutely nowhere ,  you just believe that the unusual way marino has been acting is due to the fact that you are going to be prosecuted by a special grand jury for homicide even though nothing led up to your supposed  " revelation .  "  you are truly impressive .reading this book makes me want to steer clear of blowfly and trace ,  but then again ,  maybe cornwell read some reviews and saw that she had to shape up .this book really ticked me off and i wouldn't recommend it to an enemy
if you want to spend 4 times as much money ,  8 times as much time ,  and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately  " politely refuse " --then buy this book !  the author clearly has no clue that  " less is often more .
not his best book , i thought waldo lost in new york is more authoritive .  i mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant ,  when he can't even rely on himself
in addition to the fact that i ,  too ,  felt that i was enduring a commercial for dfa ,  i was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of the only guide to a winning investment strategy you'll ever need :  index mutual funds and beyond - the way smart money invests today ,  swedroe's may ,  1998 book .  he introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations ,  but if you've read the first book ,  there's no reason to look at this one
i am newly preg too .  i went out and got this book without reading any reviews .  i sum it up this way :  a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension .  i can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a great old time enjoying those pains you will be feeling !  ie  .  . and all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet .  ha ha ha .  .  .last night ,  i'm reading her stupid book and i get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers .  i would just not be near them while they smoke .  period .  she says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers .  good idea .  .  . if that doesn't work ,  ask them all to quit because you are pregnant .  and if that doesn't work try being nice .  i don't know many smokers but i don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face .  another comment that really got me .  . take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a long time !   ( implied :  or ever !  )  i take pride in keeping myself fit .  i am a little freaked about the weight issue .  i find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted .  what about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me .even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a stepford wife .
if you've read one gary null book ,  you've read them all .   he is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject ,  but when i buy two books with different titles by gary null and find they are the same ,  i'm pretty annoyed .   his early books were taken directly from herbert sheldon's natural hygience material ,  which i assume must not have been copyrighted ,  and i felt ripped off then ,  in the 70's as i did recently when amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books .
i've read some of the other reviews ,  and i couldn't disagree more .   this book is not a page-turner .   i found myself skipping over whole sections of prose because they were boring and sometimes needless .   the story is straighforward .   hardly any surprises .   hardly any twists or turns .   bad guys are always bad guys .   good guys are always good guys .   there's no hidden agenda lurking through the story .   the blue rose is a natural anomaly .   the people who really want it -- the people willing to steal and kill for it -- are conveniently identified as people willing to steal and kill for the blue rose .   there's no  " mystery "  here really .   it's just a matter of getting to the end of the book
and you shouldn't inhale .several reviewers have ecstatically proclaimed this book and movie to be an eye-opening ,  truth-revealing work ,  but those who are credulous enough to think they learn history through agenda-focused books and films like  " hunting "  need to go back and see other  " documentaries "  like  " triumph of the will "  ,   " the eternal jew "  or  " reefer madness "  .let's be honest ,  people .this book was written by a strongly pro-clinton columnist and the movie was produced by well-known fob  ( friend of bill )  harry thompson .   it's about as objective as the factually challenged  " fahrenheit 9/11 "  ,  a work that moore himself now calls  " satire "  .    ( by the way ,  i'll bet you didn't know that many middle easterners who have seen moore's movie are outraged at the shallow ,  stereotypical and racist image he presented of their people and culture .  )the point is ,  whether intentional or just laziness these dime-a-dozen political books typically contain significant misrepresentations .   if you're already a member of the author's congregation ,  you won't care .   you'll shout  " hallelujah !  "  and say that  " hunting "  has given the world great truths .   but clear thinkers understand that it's foolish to uncritically accept the representations in either this book or the followup movie .
the companion web site mentioned in the book is not there .  when i typed in that url ,  i got redirected to peachpit's advertising site of this book ,  but no  " links "  ,   " tools "  ,  nor  " examples "  mentioned in the book at all !
this  " novel "  would be better suited for the stage .   it reads like a play ,  often .it's not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting  " high drama "  within a family .   they suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all .there are far too many scenes of shouting ,  histrionics .   the father goes from being ward cleaver to a verbally abusive monster .   if i had to see the mother one more time with her calling  " robin !  "  i was going to scream .the author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict .   this author forces the climax onto us in every scene .   he's desperate for this end result of angst ,  high drama and shock .it's overkill .   i don't believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous .   sure it happens but this was the leave it to beaver family at first .   it just doesn't make sense that because of one incident ,  all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters .in short ,  the author needs to be focused more on telling a story ,  allowing the reader to infer .   instead ,  he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn .   it's ironic ,  actually ,  as he's trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that i just felt tedium .very ,  very contrived and forced novel .   not believable .   i do not recommend
i have sent away for a book called  " lord given lovers : the holy union of david & jonathan "  as i find the subject very interesting in this day of same sex marriages ,  now that david has been used in this subject as married to jonathan ,  in the days when the scibes who wrote the law against such things ,  i would like to know why david and jonathan were not stoned to death according to that same law ,  and if david did such a thing ,  i would believe that all the jews then would have did so to ,  copying david and jonathan`s example
i'm sorry ,  but i expect more out of a book .  beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric .  after reading beautiful books such as cold mountain and brideshead revisited ,  to mention just two ,  i found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that i knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read .  at page four i was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut
i was not a huge fan of the first book ,  but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book .  this may not be the case here .  while it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first ,  it is has it's moments of unbeleiveablity .  how can dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him ,  and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him ?  the only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister ,  and i kind of think it might be only a matter of time .  i also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission .  are they going to introduce a new character to be  " on to him "  every book ?  this is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages .
i ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it .   it was terrible !   tanya holland is a beautiful black woman ,  but i feel has gone too far out of the way to create  " innovative and different "  recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food .   the price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook .   i collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others .   if you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent ,  your money would be better spent on  " essence brings you great cooking "  by jonell nash ,   " the ebony cookbook "  by freida deknight or  " the black family reunion cookbook "  by the the national council of negro women .   if you are interested in healthier soul food try ,   " the new ebony cookbook "  by charlotte lyons or  " the family dinner quilt cookbook "  by the national council of negro women .   if you are interested in diverse ,  cultural flavors ,  i would recommend vertamae grosvenor's cookbooks or  " iron pots and wooden spoons "  by jessica b .  harris .   i have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks .   they cover the gamut .   that is why i can give an honest opinion on tanya holland's book .   i just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average african american can relate to .   one that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking .
south by java head features fundamentals i find so promising :   a nautical adventure set in southeast asia during world war ii ,  written by a prominent screenwriter .   nonetheless ,  the story falls flat and i found it just barely compelling enough to finish ;  the plot moves slowly ,  punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another ,  the descriptions of action are confusing ,  and the characters mere outlines devoid of development .    i hoped this book would be as good as a 1950's nautical adventure i highly recommend ,  the wreck of the mary deare ,  but unfortunately java head is just disappointment .   for other se asia world war ii fiction ,  clavell's king rat is also a good place to start
without question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and steve allen's pivitol role it .  sadly ben alba's  " inventing late night :  steve allen and the original  " tonight show'' ,  is not that book .  it is ,  largely ,  a poorly edited and self-contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with allen's tv contemporaries .  these interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers scott berg  ( sam goldwin )  or neal gabler  ( walter winchle )  .the opening chapter ,  which addresses allen's dysfuntional up-bring ,  education and his early days in radio and tv sets the stage for the author's failure to create a full-blooded ,  well-rounded analytical portrait of allen and his work .  alba draws here ,  almost exclusively and certainly uncritically ,  from allen's memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews .  taking allen and the reader's one independent witness at face value ,  allen had a rootless ,  violent and unstable childhood .  given these negative conditions alba gives  no hint of how ,  why or even if ,  allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family .  the author gives us two brief stories from allen's adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured .  actually ,  all the stories show is that allen attended an uncle's funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his sunday night show .  how did this dysfunctional world of allen's youth effect his two marriages and five sons ?  why ,  after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did allen choose this same career field for himself ?  alba doesn't even pose such questions about the boy's effects on the man .  he just plows ahead in a haliographic haze .  throughout  " inventing .  .  .  "  alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance allen's words .  no other witnesses are called ,  no other points of view are examined .  steve tells a story ;  alba accepts it and edits it into his text .  why not read allen straight ?
if you want to buy the book ,  go ahead ,  just be careful of superbookdeals ,  they take your money but don't deliver and don't answer emails .  caveat emptor
creepiest book ever .how can i describe it ?  it's like waking from fevered dreams to find yourself in a bathtub filled with molasses and blood ,  and flies crawling in and out of your eyes ,  your nose ,  the corners of your mouth .  it is unpleasant .i don't know ,  i hate to be the philistine ,  and i suppose it's a good thing that these books exist ,  for other people ,  but for me ?  i don't want to live in such ugliness
hmmm .  i'm struggling to give agatha christie such a low rating .  she wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into .  not quick reads ,  but very methodical with lots of character development .  i don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters ,  but i always do it knowing that i will be rewarded with a great ending .  christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the &quot ; who ,  where and why&quot ;  were finally revealed in the end .  i was shocked again at the end of this book - not because i didn't know who the killer was ,  but actually because i already knew who and how .  i tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious .  very disappointing .  christie books i would recommend instead - abc murders ,  and then there were none and murder of roger ackroyd
this was a terrible disappointment .   more of a memoir than anything about book-collecting ,  it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was .   there seemed to be no context or fabric to the book .there were ,  however ,  hundreds of references to obscure authors ,  actors ,  film-writers ,  magazines and books .   there were pages at a time where i was completely lost because i had no idea about whom the author was speaking ,  but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader .baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in australia ,  thence to britain to the us and ending in france .   again ,  there is no context .   he would flip from a reference to the obscure artist ,  to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book .if viewed as a book about collecting books ,  you will not learn much .   if viewed as a memoir ,  there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions .there were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector ,  but they were too few and far between .if you could not tell by now ,  i can not see much reason to read this book .   i think mr .  baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest
i was a little disappointed .  maybe i should have shopped through a book store .
this was the first hard case publication book that i have tried .   it won't be the last ,  but i was hardly impressed with king's story .i don't so much mind having a story with no ending  ( i got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work )  ,  but couldn't king have given more of a mystery ?   that is ,  after all ,  what is expected of a crime-mystery book .   i can't believe that i was asking too much .   instead ,  i was treated to 178 pages of  " welcome to maine !  "
dr .  northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies ,  stages of life and medical procedures .   however ,  i was appalled by her bias against western cultural heritage and christianity .   her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced ,  with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women .   as a catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded ,  compassionate religious sisters ,  i felt offended by her slur against nuns .   i am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing ,  but i would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research .
when i started reading this book ,  i was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice .   unfortunately ,  i did not find it to be particularly clever or funny .   on some level ,  it seems like the pc craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written ,  and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that i expected .   we've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix  " challenged "  that it just isn't funny anymore .   i suppose that this book worked much better when it was written ,  but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since
i'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read  " grapes of wrath "  or  " east of eden .  "   instead i have focused on  " of mice and men "  and his lesser known works ,  such as  " to a god unknown "  and ,  my personal favorite ,   " pastures of heaven .  "   i've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular .when i began reading  " in dubious battle ,  "  it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck's work .   telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac ,  it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac's radical cell .   there is a great  ( and misleading )  sense of intrigue - mac and jim travel by boxcar ,  work secretly through letters ,  go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers .   early on ,  the pace is fast ,  exciting ,  and engaging .suddenly ,  steinbeck simply fails to deliver ,  leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again .   after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker's strike ,  i expected the sense of excitement to continue .   it simply never does .summary of  " in dubious battle "  - workers get mad .   workers get tired .   workers get mad .   workers get tired .   workers get mad .   workers get tired .the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking .   and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first ,  they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book .   most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration ,  and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense .  .  ..  .  . and eating .   steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story ,  because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding ,  eating ,  and  ( worst of all )  talking about food .   there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story ,  but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment ,  discussing whatever comes to mind .steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters .   but i advise any reader of  " in dubious battle "  to take this course - after the strike is initiated ,  simply set the book down .   you won't miss anything .   nothing of great import happens ,  and only a very few memorable characters ever surface ,  and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces .i suppose now i'll give  " grapes of wrath "  a go .   perhaps if it isn't one of his  " greats ,  "  it isn't worth reading
this story should have and could have been really good .  it presents a great concept ,  but the story is just so poorly crafted .  it is very sexist ,  the prose is stiff ,  and the plot is dull .  i will concede that it was interesting at times ;  it kept me reading ,  but i really didn't get much out of it .  i can only praise heinlein for including the  " intelligent conversation "  which takes place after the press conference ,  where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn .  the whole story is just very odd .  do read it though .  it's a title to read if you wish to be considered  " well read .  "  despite its faults ,  valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten ,  just as we will never forget atticus from  " to kill a mockingbird .  "
from about the second page of this book ,  i was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it .  the characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another .  add to that the stereotypical characters  ( the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys ,  the women are all  " large-assed "  or fat with the exception of ella )  .   and the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb ,  not to mention kind of repulsive  ( i like a good sex scene as much as the next person ,  but tuck's descriptions are completely banal )  .oh wait ,  there's more .  the spanish is atrocious .  it's hard to believe that tuck had a translator for this book .  it's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks spanish .  half the names are grammatically incorrect .  many of the words are just plain wrong  (  " vita "  means life in italian ,  not spanish ,  for starters )  .  i felt embarrased for the author .  does she know that her book is full of errors ?the one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is :  shallow .  i sincerely hope that readers don't mistake this book for historical fiction .  the author clearly knows little about paraguay and its people and history ,  and clearly doesn't care ,  from her superficial treatment of it .
using this book and cd-rom depends upon being able to download the customized settings ,  so that the reader's photoshop ,  for example ,  behaves the same way as the author's photoshop .  however ,  my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the cd-rom .  furthermore ,  this author doesn't start at a  " dummies "  level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons ,  so i had trouble following along .  overall ,  this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn photoshop from a baseline of complete ignorance
&quot ; i have received your new book against the human race ,  and thank you for it .  never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid .  one longs ,  in reading your book ,  to walk on all fours .  but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years ,  i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it .  nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada ,  because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me ;  because war is going on in those regions ;  and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves . &quot ;  voltaire  ( 1755
all i can say is pass me some aspirin .  this is a dozy of a bad novel .  as it says on the dust jacket ,  a supreme court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased .  its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit .  at the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence .  not only does he deal with his family ,  but his brothers friend ,  a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for .and that's only the start of the plot .its really pretty bad ,  it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions .  the characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways .  baldacci is along with james patterson and dean koontz one of america's worst authors .  if you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this ,  try one of harlan coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character myron bolitar in it .  or for a more sophisticated read ,  look for denis lehane ,  he wrote the amazing mystic river ,  but his pi series located in boston is pretty good as well .
i was very disappointed in this book even though it was a miniature .   some of the pages were blank ,  having not even been printed .   i figure the book was a total loss of money spent
the chief problem with this book is that the writer incorporates the french perspective by using citations in french with no translations .   i took 2 years of high school french but i'm not that good !   this could be overlooked except that ,  for obvious reasons ,  i was very interested to hear the perspective of french writing on this lopsided defeat .   the experience was like someone telling a long joke and them mumbling the awaited punchline ,  or someone tearing out the last page of a riveting mystery novel .   i simply can't believe key citations weren't translated .otherwise the study of henry v was great ,  and i would like to hear more about him  ( except since he died young i probably heard it all already .  )   the treatment of the battle was superficial ,  but perhaps given the lack of material this could be understood ,  but more could be done
have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on ?   for me ,  that was this book .   if you like fantasy then you might like this ,  because that is the genre of this book .   it is about a jewish girl named hannah .   she goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door .   she opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream .   she now has a new name ,  chaya .   she now has to figure out what happened ,  and what she will do in this body .   it takes place in new rochelle .   it is old times .   it doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting .   she doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it .i didn't like this book at all .   i thought it was really hard to follow .   you have to pay attention throughout the whole book .   you can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name .   this was definitely made for older adults ,  or people with a higher reading level .   if you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself ,  try this book .   i don't recommend this book if you are younger ,  or just not that well of a reader .   this is for very and i mean very good and high level readers .   i would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book .   i don't think this book was a page turner .   i wanted to put it down ,  instead of not wanting to put it down .   it never sparked my interest .   her being jewish ,  and the book being a fantasy ,  i couldn't relate to anything that happened .   this book was hard to concentrate on .   if you look up for one second ,  you miss most of the story ,  so concentrate hard .   i couldn't relate to anyone .  i am not jewish .   if you are jewish ,  you might actually understand this book better than i could .   i didn't like the genre .   it was all fake and totally unrealistic .   if you like that sort of stuff ,  then read this book ,  but i don't like fantasy .   i didn't like how it was written .   it was too hard to concentrate on .   i had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name .   i never found any surprised in the story .   i could guess what would happen next .   it was predictable .   none of the chapters had cliffhangers .   if just was boring and that's it .   i thought it was extremely boring .   i didn't understand anything and i would rather do my homework ,  than read that book .   my mind wandered a lot .   i had to read sections over and over again .   i never believed the plot one bit .   with the story being fantasy ,  everything is farfetched .   i think older people would enjoy this book ,  because they would be the only ones who could understand it .
i have read all of the artimis fowl books and loved them until nowi was disapointed with this one ,  and not found artmis unusaly irritating ,  but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good .truth be told i was younger when i read the first three ,  but still i can reread them and enjoy them  ( as i did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris )  so if you want my advice then i suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace
i didn't find the book too bad but it has no ending .   did he leave out the last chapter ?   i have always liked his books so hopefully he's got this out of his system
why someone would chose these books is beyond me ,  especially when there are so many other good choices .  literature has an impact on people and the only impact i can imagine junie having on others is negative .my daughter's first grade teacher is reading the stupid smelly school bus to her class right now .  wanting to be an involved parent ,  i borrowed a copy from the friend and read it too .  junie is a brat .  she thinks like a brat and acts like a brat .our family says ,   " thanks ,  but no thanks !
this book may be as well called  " the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls "  .   the author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories .   however ,  if you are a self-help reader like me who is used to david allen's  " getting things done "  ,  you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can
while easy enough to read ,  if the exact same pages were enclosed in a harlequin romance cover ,  i wouldn't know the difference .i'm extremely surprised this is a  " best seller "  .  maybe i should take up writing because i can't possibly be worse than this .ok ,  it's a good enough story but wow ,  it's predictible and boring .  i read it completely in 2 days ,  and i'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while .  i wasn't intrigued ,  i wasn't on the edge of my seat ,  and didn't shed a tear
the religion of peace is at it again !   in response to the popes words ,  muslims all over the world respond with violence ,  destruction ,  rage ,  hatred ,  burning down buildings ,  burning papal effigies ,  issuing fatwas against the pope ,  and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back .   wow ,  such peace from a religion of  " peace "  .   if islam is a religion of peace ,  then all the guns in the world are pink flowers ,  and every nuclear bomb ,  a soft feathery pillow .   violence for words .   destruction for speech .   please !   this is a religion of war ,  and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age .   this old bag of a man gives muslims free passes and blames america .question :   when will the world start holding to account the actions of muslims ,  and stop blaming others ,  such as bush ,  america ,  the pope ,  or god knows who else ?  how many more innocent people will die at the hand of muslims before the western world finally ,  and for the first time ,  holds the muslims accountable for their own actions ,  rather than someone else ?well im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of islamofacism .   im tired of the leftist media beating up on israel and coming to the side of middle-eastern tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words .   and then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope !   can you believe it ?  !  !   yes ,  idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word .   its unreal !   a grown man got a gun ,  deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman's backside ,  and deliberately pulled the trigger ,  purposefully killing her in cold blood .  .  .  . and yet according to socialist america-hating leftists ,  he couldn't help it .   its not his fault .  .  . its the pope's fault guys !     respond to words with violence ,  and then blame the speaker ,  absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility .   as absurd as that sounds ,  i'm sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that .   and they are idiots  ( like noam )
this novel is set in the 40's ,  when elizabeth short  ( the black dahlia )  was found murdered ,  her body cut in two .  the characters revolve around the investigation of this incident ,  altnough her name is changed .  the chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers :  one ,  an amoral cop ,  the other ,  a catholic priest ,  monsignor ,  businessman ,  whatever you want to call him .   neither one is likable ,  the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible ,  and the catholic politics/building programs are boring .   however ,  the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow .if old cop stories appeal to you ,  you might like this ,  but i'm sure you could find better .   double indemnity ,  for instance ,  is superior
sometime ago i read my sunday paper and noted that  " three junes "  was listed as a popular book choice .   the title sounded interesting so i bought it .   that was 2 months ago and i am still trying to get through the paperback edition .   it is difficult to follow the timeline ,  to understand the characters and where they fit ,  and to get involved in the storyline .   i will finish the book because that's my style .   it has not been a book that i could not wait to get back to .
i have long had the desire to read a grisham book ,  because i have heard good things .   well ,  my chance came and i was sorely disappointed .   the audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and i decided to get them for the chamber .   the opening to the book kept me going ,  but by chapter three ,  i had already decided this ,   " if sam cayhall lives i'm going to be mad because i get furious about hate crimes ,  and if he dies ,  he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the  " hero "  to the story .  "   sadly ,  i pursued curious about the ending .   i'm very glad i got the cds instead of the book ,  because it only took six hours to get through it .   sure wish i had those six hours back and the money invested so i could try a diferent author .   mayber grisham's other books are better ,  but i won't be reading them
when our book club selected this novel ,  i was enthusiastic ~ the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story .   however ,  after the first chapter or so ,  i kept waiting for the big  " wow "  factor .  .  . and it never came .   i found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well-developed .   like other readers ,  i finished it out of obligation ,  but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it .
i gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas .  the best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book .  i have read :  carolyn ,  bill ,  and amy's books and i want to give this one a try .this book is truly for the apprentice tv lover but if you are looking for business advice this is not the book for you
not the most exciting book out there .   but if you like minor league baseball ,  this book's worth a quick read .
there is no measure how harmful and disastrous this  " sermon "  has been to all who have read or heard it .   the teaching of hell or everlasting damnation  ( eternal torment )  is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of christianity over 1800 years ago .   the first century church never believed in a  " hell "  .   the theory of hell was brought in by converts to christianity from  pagan religions of the world .    " hell "  was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and  " converting "  effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as  " orthodox "  centuries after the resurrection of christ .   our english translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact ,  when it is actually fiction .   mostly all english versions except the concordant literal new testament and young's literal propagate this fallacy .do your homework .   go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up .   if you scoff then here is your challenge .   do the research from a non-traditional ,  non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise god about .other highly recommended books are  " the inescapable love of god "  by thomas talbott  ( isbn :  1581128312 ,  not on amazon ,  you must google it )  ,   " the origin and history of the doctrine of endless punishment "  by thomas thayer ,   " the bible hell "  by dr .  john wesley hanson .   go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what  " hell "  is and where it came from .   you will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out .all those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on ,  to you i say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of god that it creates .   that is hell indeed ,  and that is the only hell that exists
this is a highly influential book .   roosevelt has had many enemies growing out of his presidency .   no one has had the same negative impact on roosevelt's name to equal wyman's attack .   but ,  although wyman ,  a  professional historian has well-documented his research ,  much of the  indictment of the roosevelt administration is based upon conjecture  incapable of proof .   the litmus test of his proposals was the bombing of  auschwitz .   he asserts that the failure to bomb was due to a lack of  caring .   thousands of jews could have been saved .   but there is no way to  prove this .   many jews could also have died because bombing was inaccurate  and jewish prisoners lived close to the crematoria .   too much in his  charges is based on too little evidence .   peter novick in his book ,  the  holocaust in american life ,  calls wyman's thesis a &quot ; comfortable  morality tale&quot ;  and &quot ; bad history . &quot ;   in addition to novick ,   henry l .  feingold ,  frank w .  brecher ,  and william rubinstein have written  critically about wyman
this is one of the worst books ever ,  don't buy it
this book is not worth wasting your money on .   the techniques that are represented look ok to the untrained eye ,  but if you examine them closely ,  you will notice many mistakes .   the techniques are sparse ,  one per angle .   they are also demonstrated with poor posture and attack .   to the novice ,   this book may appear to represent the art of cabales serrada escrima ,  but  it does not .   more than half of the book is unrelated to the system of  serrada .  this book does nothing to show the effectiveness of cabales  serrada escrima
well ,  if anything this was a decently written story ,  with good dialect and character detail .  however ,  this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending .  grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there .the story starts off with pi kinsey milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door .  she opens it to find janice kepler ,  mother of lorna kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death .  not only this ,  but she also explains to kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house .  they talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until janice tells kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after lorna's death .  this tape leads kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer .millhone dives even further and searches through the world of lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive ,  elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount .  kinsey also checks up on lorna's family members ,  and with the exception of janice ,  all seem to have a motive to murder her lorna .not being a fan of these types of novels ,  i decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere .  by the middle of the novel i wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story ,  but when i got to the end i had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended .  i stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like grafton did too .  the ending left me with a strange feeling and i didn't know if the book had actually ended .  all in all ,  it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan ,  try any other of grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one
the book is basically a dictionary of terms in the computer graphic field .   all most the whole book contain very simple ideas and concept i knew already .also lynn pocock doesn't even do computer graphic work professionally .   i have yet to see any computer animation works by the writer .save your money
after reading the first book * ( which was catastropha )  and reading the second which was really good ,  i thought that the series is taking off ,  i was mistaken ,  the third book is slow ,  and boring ,  you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that seriesnothing much is happening ,  and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas ,  the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find  ( and better written as well )  in dragon lance series ,  or other adventure books ,  also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books ,reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book ,  which some say is very boringi guess this is where the adventure end for me .  .
this book is great !  assuming you already have a ph .  d .  in political science .  otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting ,  or light reference .  the author shows bias towards the united states' form of  democracy ,  as is to be expected in such a book .  the simplistic nature makes  the reader annoyed more than informed .  the childish approach is suited for  school children ,  but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis
my 60s something father gave me this book .  i am a 45-year-old middle-class man with a 6-year-old son using my wife's account .  i don't understand for whom this book is written .  it is full of painfully obvious advice such as  " don't play with your food "  or  " do not throw golf clubs .  .  .  in anger .  "  anyone raised in america  ( presuming that is the author's intended audience )  who doesn't already understand these things and take them to heart isn't going to be interested in reading about them in a book ,  if they can even read .  chapter 15 deals with staring and differences where the author admonishes :   " do not repeat racist ,  sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence .  "  if you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this .  if you are ,  this book isn't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it .  i found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet .  if the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated ,  dream on !  i think the author has a professor henry higgins jones .  i am also concerned about my father's opinion of me ,  i mean  " do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store .  "  duh
very average book !   frei doesn't go down as one of my favorite sports writers .  loves to sensationlize rather then just tell a great story
i thought this book was going to be a great legal thriller ,  but little did i know that it would turn out to be the worst book i have ever read .  i expected a lot more out of scott turow ,  who wrote  " one l "  ,  which i loved ,  but this book was plan boring .  the begining started out slow and it never picked up from there !  the worst legal thriller ,  ever
as i've said before national hypnosis !  !  !  liberals want to dupe the masses into believing that modern conservatism and lberalism are different ideologies  ( they both come from hegel and machiavelli the philosophies that gave birth to communism and facism )  .
one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm .  no way !  .  those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences .  this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring .  the action doesn't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then ,  the cliched writing and deification of balf's subjects make this book very hard to get through .  unless you are a serious kayaking fan ,  i would not recommend this book
hank hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of israel is concerned .   he is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups ,  to include pretribulationists .   indeed ,  his  " scholarship "  is no scholarship at all ;  it is pure propaganda .  .  .  .   to see real scholarship ,  get tim cohen's materials  ( see below )  :tim lahaye ,  jerry jenkins ,  and others in the pre-trib circle ,  such as ed hindson ,  tommy ice ,  chuck missler ,  zola levitt ,  thomas mccall ,  john hagee ,  grant jeffrey ,  marlin maddox ,  perry stone ,  texe marrs ,  john walvoord  ( deceased )  ,  etc .  ,  continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago .   the notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture ,  it is foreign to the teachings of the early church ,  and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming .   these men are novices and not prophecy  " experts "  or  " scholars "  by any stretch of the imagination ;  they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians .   why continue to be deceived ?   tim cohen ,  in his excellent book ,   " the antichrist and a cup of tea ,  "  provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now .   not only that ,  the same author  ( tim cohen )  has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ :   " the real rapture "  .   if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture ,  then you need to hear tim cohen's  " the real rapture "   ( based on a volume in his forthcoming  " messiah ,  history ,  and the tribulation period "  series  ( see prophecy house's site for details on these items ,  which are also available via amazon )
this book states that it's better to die than survive a rape :" also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity .  once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained .  even in a forced contact such as rape or incest ,  the injured one is greatly outraged .  if she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed ,  she is of course in a more favorable position .  there is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation .  it is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle .  "   ( p . 196 )how much more twisted can it get ?
when i bought this book ,  i didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of friedman's collumns in the times .   i think friedman is a great author with lots of great insights ,  but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as i would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments .   since the sections are arranged chronologically ,  there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together .if you really like friedman ,  then it's worth a read ,  but if you are in it for just one ,  i'd read the lexus and the olive tree first .   it is by far his best
i had to read jared diamond's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim .  the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important .  however ,  there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns ,  germs  ( more than the other 2 )  ,  and steel .  of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns ,  germs and steel .  i enjoyed parts of the book considerably ,  but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book .  i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs ,   " collapse "  - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history .  it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now .  -rk
the book was specific to one particular model of blackberry .  they should have that in the title .  it was of no use to me .  after five minutes ,  i set it aside to gather dust .
i was lured into reading under the volcano after seeing its inclusion on the modern library's one hundred best of the 20th century and after reading a reviewer compare it to james joyce  ( i am an amateur joycean who tries to read ulysess ,  portrait of the artist ,  and dubliners at least annually )  .   lowry has nothing that likens him to joyce .   this book is leaden and tedious .   i forced myself to finish it because i hate to start a  book and not finish it .   but it was no labor of love .   it was simply a labor .
while i very much enjoyed miss wearstler's first book ,  i found domicilium decoratus to be borderline obnoxious .  rather than show great decorating ,  the book focused mainly on close up shots of objects in her house that took up the whole page . in addition ,  i feel that as the viewer of the book i do not need to see fifteen entire  pages of miss wearstler dressed in ball gowns pretending to be domestic
this was a less than stellar sequal to the women of the silk but it did finish the story of pei to some extent .   i found the historical aspect of the novel the most interesting and the story of the women the least believabl
i appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us .  however ,  i could see a hole in csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning ." in the course of my studies i tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves ,  and why .  my first studies involved a few hundred  " experts " --artists ,  athletes ,  musicians ,  chess masters ,  and surgeons ,  in other words ,  people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred .  "i'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and  " optimal experience "  .  particularly the reference to artists and musicians ,  who typically have severe struggles with life ,  and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years .  that is what i felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness .it goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life ,  while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed ,  did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness .
sadly ,  this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today .   between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects ,  it can take ages to puzzle out a page .   some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner  " we're here ,  "  which has picked up over-privileged harvey cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner ,  i could not grasp the point or moral of .   my husband has read all the patrick o'brian series ,  so i asked him to puzzle out a representative story ,  that of counahan the navigator ,  and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood ,  he said ,   " honey ,  i see what you mean .  "    one can get the general gist ,  but it's best to read through fast ,  then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense .for example ,  when educated harvey says ,   " why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories ?  "  his pal dan answers ,   " allus can ,  till we begin to dress daown .   efter thet ,  the heads and offals ,  'u'd scare the fish to fundy .   boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive ,  though ,  unless ye know as much as dad knows .   guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night .   harder on the back ,  this ,  than frum the dory ,  ain't it ?  "i got my b . a .  in english ,  and i would rather tackle joyce's  " ulysses "  than an unannotated version of this book .so why did i bother ?   a few days ago ,  a friend showed us the dvd of the 1937 movie ,  starring spencer tracy and lionel barrymore ,  on his big screen home theater ,  and it was thrilling and very moving .   the movie is quite different from the book ,  though ,  but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how kipling crafted the story ,  as it did for me .   but dear teachers ,  please ,  do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever !    ( let them read  " cannery row "  instead !  )
like most great diplomatic moments ,  successes and failures alike ,  decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the camp david debacle can appear .   even then ,  disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after .   given the wide interest in the israeli-arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations ,  new works exploring the crucial climax at camp david remain welcome .   some dismiss mr .  swisher's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team ,  but instead was responsible at camp david only for negotiations .   that seems to me unfair .   clayton swisher clearly did considerable  " leg work "  to prepare this text ;  sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect .mr .  swisher's book follows on the heels of dennis ross's interesting  " the missing peace "  and ,  given mr .  ross's direct involvement in the negotiations ;  no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well .   however ,  mr .  swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at mr .  ross's feet ,  even when he makes claims that others at camp david ,  many more central then mr .  swisher directly contradict his statements .   much for example is made in this work of mr .  ross's change of  " municipal jerusalem "  to  " greater jerusalem "  in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement .   unfortunately ,  ross's change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by robert malley ,  a member of the us team and now often a talking head representing the palestinian point of view ,  who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties .   malley has never denied this .   moreover ,  days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down .swisher's target ,  perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view ,  shifts the blame wherever he can to israel and the us negotiating team .   while such an effort might well be reasonable ,  mr .  swisher often twists facts ,  making excuses for palestinian gaffs while blowing minor facts out of all proportion .   for example ,  mr .  swisher brushes aside the days lost when mr .  arafat and the palestinian team insisted that jews had no historic link to jerusalem or the temple mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as mere posturing .   however ,  he never mentions that such ideas ,  undermining the jewish people very claim to the land ,  serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost impossible .   nor does swisher ever consider the palestinians failure to negotiate in good faith ,  treating every israeli offer simply as a new base line ,  rather than offering any proposals of their own .   again ,  even robert malley concedes that this disingenuous strategy by the palestinians likely doomed camp david from the start .swisher's dismissal of all israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as silly israel's interest and the palestinian's refusal of any compromise for the so-called  " right of return ,  "  or the claim that all palestinian who left the area of modern israel and all their descendants must have a right immigrate to israel ,  a right held by no other people .   as to the simple fact that this would lead to the destruction of the jewish state and that the palestinians are thus expecting israel to commit national suicide ,  on this problem mr .  swisher remains silent .lastly ,  one cannot help but marvel at mr .  swisher's odd coverage of the events after camp david .   that yasser arafat led a bloody war against israel rather than offering an alternative proposal for peace is dismissed .   mr .  swisher combs through events searching for ,  magnifying ,  and twisting any event that will make israel look bad ,  while at the same time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of suicide terrorists who have murdered hundreds of israeli civilians in cold blood .   mr .  swisher even parrots points of palestinian propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even palestinian leaders no longer mention them ,  such as the claim of massacres during israeli operations in jenin ,  which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing more than a fabrication .curiosity will cause readers to ask why mr .  swisher takes this extremely biased view .   fortunately ,  he lays out his rather simplistic point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following ,   " the primary reason for arab and muslim anger against america has been and remains unbridled support for israel's oppression of the palestinians .  "   again ,  one can only muse as to why mr .  swisher does not take osama bin laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his hatred manifests from the presence of american christian soldiers in the heart of islamic holy lands like saudi arabia and later iraq .   surely neither the bombings in madrid or more recently in london had anything to do with israel ,  but it seems for mr .  swisher's simplistic world view ,  it is at the door step of the jewish state where all blame is to be laid .
the paleo diet is based on an interesting premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment .  it seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat .  animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time ,  because their decisions are instinctual .  self-awareness creates a problem that doesn't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans .  sometimes we do things out of curiosity ,  or laziness ,  or false beliefs .  so ,  considering the erratic behavior of present-day humans ,  who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs ?  even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error ,  frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild .the fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact .  rather ,  eat more wild-sourced food .  just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food ,  unless the environment from which it comes is polluted- and that is a very real problem .meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays ,  not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era .  the paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world .  now ,  we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh ,  and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals .  beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion ,  as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy .  this is no longer true .  the average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal ,  fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme .  basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous .  you must choose your meat sources carefully .  meat made from free-range animals raised on pesticide-free in a caring manner can be very hard to find .i found loren's rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded ,  and in some cases irresponsible .  there is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation ,  and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture :  high fructose corn syrup ,  trans-fatty acids ,  artifical sweeteners ,  uncleaned foods raised non-organically with pesticides and herbicides ,  and improperly raised food animals .my main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages  ( about half )  of the book is dedicated to the spiel- convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time .  i think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose .  after a while you get the feeling loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you ,  and it really interferes with the flow of the book .further ,  a lot  ( but not all )  of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet .  the claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine ,  and peppered throughout the book .  but it's hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited .one last nitpick .  one great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices .  something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world .  it's a pity the recipes included do not explore those ,  but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead .  espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet ,  and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining .  i found the recipes far too traditional and western-centric .
dobson has it wrong .  children's susceptibility to god and the attributes of god has to do with rearing them with the love of god in their hearts from the beginning ,  praying and relying on god ,  and being taught to please god .  violence begets violence .  to spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional ,  physical and spiritual evolution of children .  ignorance begets ignorance ,  and if you're in charge of children ,  feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child
imagine ,  just as i was getting bored with this book ,  through an odd act of  contingence its binding literally fell apart in my hands .   a  loki-eshu-hermetic encounter ?   what a thankful rescue .   rambling and  indulgent ,  such repetition would be better kept to a long essay rather than  a full book .   a trickster's story ,  indeed
i read this book ,  it was okay but the story flashed back to much ,  and i couldn't folow all of it but i read all of it anyway .  i wouldn't recommend it .  too slow moving ,  and boring because of the flashbacks .  the movie was the same way
i am an avid reader ,  and i will finish a book no matter how difficult it is ,  or how boring it is ,  and i couldn't finish this one .  it was so dry - and i couldn't connect with any of the characters .  i was really disappointed
this book is filthy .   i had to take a shower after i read it .   why doesn't he get a job ?   why does he have to live in france ?  why doesn't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers ?   so many questions .   people just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say james michenier because it was banned .   it was banned because it's a bad book
this book does a good job of telling you what your ipaq can do but a very poor job of telling you how to do it .   i wanted more information about how to set up my ipaq to connect with the internet .   the book told me it could be done and how wonderful it was ,  but lacked specific information about which screen to go to and how to actually make it work .i later purchased ipaq for dummies .   this book told me what the ipaq could do and specifically how to do it .   it was great .   the dummies book also gave lots of information on programs that are very helpful to add to your ipaq .i was disappointed with ipaq pocket pc but very happy to get my hands on ipaq for dummies !
mark twain called the book of mormon  " chloroform in print "  and he wasn't kidding .   it is by far the most boring read i have encountered  ( i could barely get through it )  .   i am a woman of faith - faith in god and faith in christ and i don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish .   please ,  anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church .   ask some hard questions  ( you will likely get a rehearsed answer ,  but it's worth a shot )  .joseph smith was accused  ( and fined with a misdimeanor )  of being a  " glass looker "  - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the spanish .  he would use  " magic stones "  that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location .   so convenient that he later found  " gold plates "  and used what he called the  " urim and thum "   ( which ,  by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the high priests of israel in biblical times )  to translate these plates  ( he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat )  .there are so many myths that are told by members of the church  " most men were so distraught at the thought of polygamy "  ,  the age issue of joseph translating the book of mormon ,  joseph smith's actual role in polygamy  ( which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband .  .  .   11 of josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him ,  having never divorced the first husband - what's up with that ?  ?  ?  )  .  .  etc .  .  and the list goes on and on .  .  .i am not disputing that mormons take care of their own .  .  .  that they are often kind people who have good hearts ,  i think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great !  just please do some homework first and don't just rely on the  " power of prayer "  .   there is a reason that utah is the  [  .  .  .  ]  capital of the usa  ( i'm sure every one of those people  " prayed "  about that big business decision - it can often be mis-intrepreted )  .
while it is true that brandenburg is a tremendous photographer and the majority of photos are simply breathtaking .   i returned my copy because the datebook also contained disturbing photos of dead wildlife .   i'm very tender when it comes to wildlife ,  and while i know that death is a natural part of the life cycle ,  i am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures .   for anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos ,  then this is not the book for them .   otherwise ,  i would recommend it
i concur with another reviewer :  get luigi gambero's  " mary and the fathers of the church ,  "  and ,  i might add ,  his follow-up work ,   " mary in the middle ages .  "   read these two books alongside  " truly our sister .   .   .  ,  "  then decide whether 15 or 16 centuries of organic ,  historically contiguous development of the church's marian doctrine by some of the finest minds and hearts the church has ever produced--including bridget of sweden ,  or johnson's glib ,  21st century ,  feminist revisionism provides the better spiritual nourishment .the blessed virgin mary stirs us to properly love her divine son ,  bringing us into the intimate recesses of the trinitarian love itself !   anything shy of that simply misses the point and leaves one painfully short-changed .
this smugly-edited series has become a dreary example of careerist nepotism and features mainly short stories with linebreaks and jokey poems that are not funny .some choice awful lines :denise duhamel :   " don't give into your cravings ,  you need to stay lean / so you can lift up your skirt as you prance and twirl .  .  .  "kim addonizio :   " better dead then fed .  / he who laughs will not last .  / sticks and stones will break you ,  "thomas lux :   " that the eyes be gouged out / and replaced by hot coals / in the head ,  _the blockhead_ , / of each countrymen or woman who ,  / upon reaching their majority ,  / has yet to read moby dick .  .  .  "most of the poems herein ,  besides franz wright and paul violi among a scattered few ,  would have been better off as just titles than full poems .  the big name poets featured have generally written better poems ,  the younger poets all seem to have some connection to the new school .  it's incredibly disappointing :  the best american poetry 2006 could have been so much more .  instead ,  *it's* a joke
this book deals with some fairly rediculous topics .   i'm not into mysticism or talisman's or that stuff ,  so perhaps i am biased .it did provide a useful history of the 'masonic' symbol on the american one-dollar bill ,  which i enjoyed .but hieronimus puts forth far too much theory regarding supernatural powers for my taste
if you're thinking of reading this book ,  let me save you some time--don't .   i like a good literary read as much as the next guy  ( really )  ,  and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners ,  but this book ,  in perfectly plain english ,  sucked .   there is no plot ,  no beginning ,  middle or end ,  and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward .   it didn't help ,  but it didn't make a wit of difference either .   do your self a favor and skip it
i'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with .   however ,  my public library has a limited selection of audio books ,  so i take what i can get .   i am a voracious reader ,  and i listen to audios to get more  " reading "  in ,  as you can listen and do other things .   i much prefer the lillian jackson braun  " cat "  books ,  at least there is some humor ,  and i like the  " mystery "  part of these books better than deaver's .   sorry to all the deaver fan's out there .  .  . i have enjoyed a few of his books ,  but i get tired of the  " same ole-same ole "
it took me a year to finally complete this book .   and honestly ,  the only reason i completed it was because i had nothing else on my bookshelf to read .   this book dragged on and on to the tiny climax about 5 pages from the end .   what a waste of such a beautiful book cover .   do not waste a year of your life or a dime of your money
this book is more of the same rehashed ,  recycled ,  repurposed content from the authors .  much of this material is available in any basic marketing text .  in fact ,  this book reads strikingly similar to just about any training manual on the basics of branding .  if you've worked at any of the big agencies :  mccann ,  jwt ,  y&r ,  you learn the contents of this book on your first day in about a hour .  all the cases cited in this book are stale and extremely weak .  the  " editorial reviews "  listed above are shill quotes from clients who are cited as  " cases "  in the book .remember this before you buy :  the author ,  and the firm for whom he works ,  use this book as nothing more than a lead-generation tool--it's called  " thought leadership "  ,  a nebulous term used by company to propagate its own way of thinking .  save your money .  don't become a victim of prophet's propoganda .  buy something with substance like jean noel kapferer .
then you'll probably like this story .my wife and i read books together and i'd sworn off cornwell after hornet's nest  ( which on tv cornwell admitted was some warmed over college material - and it showed horribly )  .   the scarpetta character  ( in some books )  is unbelievably emotionally ultra-hyper  ( going from confident to terrified every time marino knocks on the door )  .in this book she was mercifully level headed almost all the time !   what a relief .   and there was a real story .   i'm not really a fan of her work over the last 10 years but there's almost enough lab details here to satisfy .   sure wish she  ( scarpetta )  would learn to delegate - imagine the top lab expert for her state and she has to go to every crime scene and move bodies herself !anyway don't start here with the scarpetta series - but if you already like the character ,  this one is a b+ .   compared to other crime novels in general ,  it's still a c- in my estimation
.  .  .  and the maps are worthless .two examples of the many glaring inaccuracies contained in this book :1 )  rick claims you can pick up a bus map in any tourist information kiosk .   the following is an actual transcript of our conversation with the tourist info lady :us :  buon giorno .   do you speak english ?info lady :  of course .us :  we'd like to go to vatican city .   may we have a bus map please ?info lady :  a bus map ?  for roma ?us :  um ,  yes .info lady :  no such thing exists .2 )  rick claims you can see everything you want to see in the vatican in one morning :  st .  peter's basilica ,  the vatican museums ,  the sistine chapel - everything .  um ,  rick ?  have you ever been there ?  did you notice the 40 , 000 other people there all trying to get in to the same things ?  did you notice the priceless and beautiful works of art on practically every surface ?   did it occur to you that people might ,  perhaps ,  want to stop and admire a large number of them ?  light a candle ?  say a prayer ?  some of us ,  also ,  have to behind a crowd of 35 elderly germans to look at michaelangelo's pieta ,  and everything else .methinks ol' rick either spends an average of 15 minutes apiece on the most astonishing and pleasurable spots in rome ,  or is comfortable elbowing foreign senior citizens in the ribs
the reviewer below who said  " more heat than light "  got it partly right .   this book is so badly written you have to wonder if the author's other works were written by the same person .  not only is it sophomoric ,  it is gibberish .   had its author been unknown ,  she would surely have had to pay for the book's publication .  incredibly bad ,  it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers
pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought ;  he mistakes child abuse for some form of  " real "  child rearing .   i just read his interview in the guardian uk .    although it has been years since i have read this book ,  it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when i think about it .   i have read philosophy from classic to contemporary ;  i have lived in japan and practiced zen archery and zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of western and eastern philosophy yet pirgsig ,  to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon .  this is proof that pirsig remains deranged .   moreover ,  in the guardian uk interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered ;  pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder .  pirsig is a perfect example of someone with narcisstic personality disorder .   pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother .if you are one of the poor souls who finds something  " deep "  in this very large pile of verbal manure then i think therapy would be money well spent
the very title for the book -  " i con "  - despite its cleverness ,  should reveal the lack of any objectivity ,  or class for that matter ,  from the authors ,  jeffrey s .  young & william l .  simon .i could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts ,  poor research ,  colored by a palpable disdain for  [ arguably the most interesting legend of our time ]  steve jobs .what is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards steve jobs ,  seems 'personal' ;  which ,  in a democratic sense ,  may be alright i guess ,   [ but only ]  until facts begin to wear thin ,  and the research seems doctored ,  leaving the rants sounding hollow ,  unsavory and shrill .and the facts aren't well-strung together either !from the very opening description in the book ,  which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a  " reformed "  steve jobs ,  to apple in 1997  ( as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred )  ,  to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations ,  and quite often blatant slanders about jobs ,  the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors ,  whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-steve sentiment among its readers !if you happen to be one of those people ,  who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering  [ especially steve jobs ]  ,  then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy
i was more than willing to give none dare call it treason a chance ,  as i found the scale of stormer's research impressive .  however ,  the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive communist takeover in america came to pass ,  coupled with his outspoken admiration for mccarthy and truly insane predictions like this :" once the takeover comes ,  you ,  like millions of others ,  who believe in god and man's responsibility for his own actions ,  can be slaughtered like diseased animals or worked to death in slave labor camps or brothels for the red army .  "  p .  20have forced me to conclude that stormer's thesis was overwhelmingly incorrect .  perhaps the most irritating part of the book was his suggestion that the american educative system was hopelessly pro-communist .  the fact that none dare call it treason was distributed in american high school classes rather undermines his argument .the sad thing is ,  because none dare call it treason is so exhaustively researched ,  it is far too dry to be amusing ,  even when read ironically .  and ironic amusement is the only positive product of propaganda .in closing ,  i would take communism over john a .  stormer's america any day
investment biker :  1-1/2 stars ,  just barely escapes the lowest possible rating .this is a book about what a tom wolfe-style master of the universe does on holiday .  it's nearly impossible to have an  " adventure "  when you are carrying 10 (  !  )  platinum credit cards .  he got cold and wet a few times ,  worried about finding gas ,  didn't always have hotel rooms up to his standards ,  and had delays at some borders ,  yawn .the adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to new york using one of his many visa cards .i rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the same time mr .  rogers was having his  " adventure .  "  i am stunned that he perceived so little in his long travels .   i don't know how someone could travel in foreign countries that extensively and end up completely unchanged by the experience .   however ,  this fits perfectly with his huge arrogance ,  which is truly the theme of the book .   he already knows it all and will tell you all about it .which makes one wonder :   why did he bother to leave ny city in the first place ?   i guess it was a good opportunity to pose with and boink the attractive and young  ( naive and pliable ?  -- certainly lubricious )  daughter of one of his clients .   and a good opportunity to pump himself up by feeling superior to all those  " brown faces "  he's driving through .   the arrogance ,  the arrogance !   typical privileged ,  right-wing know-it-all .   i'd like to see him try to survive in the peruvian highlands without all his money and fancy equipment .this is not a travel book :  mr .  rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a long economic rant .  you can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his final chapter ,   " afterword .  "  i will summarize his position :  governments are bad ;  smart ,  rich guys like me are good  ( remember october 1929 ?  )  .  many of his predictions are laughably wrong .  he advocated selling the us economy short in 1993 .   look at the us stock market performance from 1993 through 2000  .  .  .   gosh !   idiot !   some reviews are touting his prescience on markets .   hello ?   how about his predictions on the biggest economy in the world ?mr .  rogers' writing is very poor and it's loaded with cliche's .  he and tabitha are always zooming on  " powerful steeds "  into  " gorgeous scenery "  ,  or  " steep ,  craggy mountains "  into  " glitzy ,  glamorous hotspots "  or  " delightful ,  cozy hostels "  ,  or across  " hot ,  empty ,  flat deserts "  into  " dumps "  that are not up to american standards .  he'll  " describe "  one of the greatest mountain chains on earth ,  the andes ,  as  " the top of the world "   ( p .  315 )  for five short sentences and then move on to more important matters like further adventures with border guards and investing .   great writing ?   rubbish !   i think he used a computer program to come up with his  " descriptions "  of the places he went .mr .  rogers is woefully ignorant about the places he goes - and he doesn't learn anything along the way .  he views the world exclusively through the keyhole of economics .  most of the  " interesting facts "  he mentions about theses places are just wrong .  one indicative example :  he describes the moreno glacier in argentina as ,   " one of the few in the world still moving .  "   ( p .  294 )  i found myself laughing out loud many times at his  " facts "  and descriptions .if you want to understand the distribution of goods in the world ,  read  " guns ,  germs ,  and steel ,  "  by jared diamond .  if you want to read about a real motorcycle trip ,  read ted simon's  " jupiter's travels ,  "  or robert fulton's ,   " one-man caravan .  "for good travel books ,  try :    " seven years in tibet "   ( harrer )  ,   " news from tartary "   ( fleming )  ,   " arabian sands "   ( thesiger )  ,   " gypsy moth circles the world "   ( chichester )  ,   " sailing around the world "   ( slocum )  ,   " motoring with mohammed "   ( hanson )  ,   " full tilt "   ( murphy )  ,   " a short walk in the hindu kush "   ( newby )  ,  or  " eastern approaches "   ( maclean )   " my life with the eskimo "   ( stefansson )  ,   " endurance "   ( lansing )  .   i could go on and on .    " investment biker "  is poorly-written drivel compared to all these and so many more ." investment biker ,  "  a classic ?  that's ridiculous .from another review :    " greatest book on finance ,  business ,  travels ever "   that comment almost leaves me speechless .   obviously written by someone who has read very few travel books indeed
the first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good .   in fact ,  it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious .   according to the rumor  ( the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates )  she was ,  however ,  but we the audience don't know that .   however ,  the young woman is quick to think she has been raped .   why there is no attempt at a physical exam ,  is unexplained ,  especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin ,  however it turns out she isn't ,  so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes .   fortunately ,  we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies ,  either ,  so this doesn't turn into a soap opera .   however ,  we do have the dreamboat  " hero "  who dreams up the rumor about her being raped ,  and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout .  but that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable ,  being insufferably full of themselves .   the last half of the film ,  'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character ,  and it's his story we're following ,  whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film ,  and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters .  turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together ;  which means issues they have to work out ,  and everyone else  ( in a way ,  the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement )  is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth ,  though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance ;  not justice .   and vengeance when it's not the comic book variety ,  isn't fun for an audience ,  it's just distasteful .   in other words ,  the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves ,  and left the rest of us alone .   so from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment ?  - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever .   there is merely too much story ,  so it becomes ridiculous .   a basically good premise is ruined .   if you are a fan of any of the stars involved ,  it might be worth viewing ,  if only once ,  but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth .   perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading gossip ,  or in this case deliberate lies ,  is that what goes around comes around ,  and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach .   i almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway ,  but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once ,  just to be sure where this is headed
ashley judd's  ( normal life ,  the locusts )  husband ,  played by jim caviezel  ( the passion of the christ ,  frequency )  gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in el salvador a bunch of years ago .  so ,  judd hires the always superb morgan freeman  ( unleashed ,  million dollar baby )  to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment .  judd then has threats on her life after .  the opening sequence pulls you in ,  the thrills are a mixed bag  ( car crash scene for example was good )  and the outcome ,  well ,  i really saw coming anyway .  ashley judd's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband ( double jeopardy )  .  twisted and kiss the girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin .  also starring bruce davison  ( x-men ,  dahmer )  ,  amanda peet  ( the whole nine yards ,  the whole ten yards )  and tom bower  ( die hard 2
well you know the drill .  some people will like anything that is  " artsy "  or  " out of the ordinary "  or  " made by that great director "  .  its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless .the movie is about incest .  it is about sex and adolescence .  and ,  ironically ,  it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews .  the best part of this movie is eva green .  or ,  more precisely ,  eva green's body .  i didn't care about her acting  ( i thought it was mediocre )  .  i just sat there and drunk her body in ,  wishing that i was that lucky actor  ( whats his name again ?  )  .  the only reason to watch this movie is eva green .  if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation ,  then i am glad it happened .  the movie is visually rich .  in fact ,  its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see .  but i will take it .  he captures and celebrates eve green's stunning body - every square millimeter of it ( including her genitals - the movie is nc17 for a reason )  ,  to perfection .  other than that ,  there is nothing else in the movie .  the story is utterly insipid ,  the old movie clips ,  the  " discussion "  of morality or whatever  .  .  .  nothing interesting .  the music is another plus point .bottomline ,  watch it for eva green's body .  it deserves five stars .  but the movie deserves only two
this movie was so horrible i don't know where to start .  maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street .  or maybe he just casted his own family .  .  . at any rate they were untrained and stale .  secondly ,  i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles .  if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays ,  why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit .  .  . if you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience .  furthermore ,  i thought the bible said a little something against divorce ;  like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication .  this movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of god if you're in love .  in fact ,  christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice .  .  .  . by even the protagonist !  i laugh as i think of the scene where ce-ce peniston's character says seductively ,   " i'm looking for a man with his mind on jesus "  yet she's dressed like a hooker .  speaking of clothing ,  why did ce-ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene .  they go on a date and she's dressed one way ,  by the time they come home she has on something different ;  with no logical explanation .  and please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of rico suave .  maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream .  i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him .  in addition ,  the soundtrack ,  it-was-just-annoying .  at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music .  i just wanted the maddness to stop !  lastly ,  it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate  ( although some are )  however ,  having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just ,  well ,  almost juvenile .  .  . perhaps even a disrespect to women at large .  overall ,  this movie made me want to puke .  pastor larry  " flash "  jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity
bette midler and woody allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing .  instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as bette and woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school .  they also discover that they have been cheating on one another .  the movie gets boring rather fast as bette and woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters .  i would have expected better from these two
i guess when any era becomes old enough for the  " nostaglia craze "  to hit ,  we get to see what exagerations get stretched to the point of lying .  case in point the 1950's were not such an innocent age ,  and the 1970's were not that wild .studio 54 ,  and the disco era in general were about freedom ,  great music ,  great people watching ,  and in general having a hell of a goodtime .  for the brief period that it ruled the music charts ,  disco broke down barriers ,  and the stars of certain musical genres were able to crossover .  i often call 1979  " the year that music got close to the light "  .my big issue with this movie is that it failed to show that for many of us we took advantage of the liberation of disco's  ( like 54 )  ,  and enjoyed ourselves .  it was glamorous ,  it was over the top ,  and it was fun .  amazing as it seems ,  many of us did not inhail cocaine like air ,  and for some of us who did indulge ,  we did not become adicts ,  or for that matter guilt ladden .clubs like studio 54 were great palaces that broke down many barriers ,  and helped us escape the many issues facing the nation in the late 70's .too bad this movie did not convey it .
just rented this dvd and was quite surprised .   normally ,  i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan .   however ,  in this film ,  their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script ,  editing ,  and direction which made this film quite dull to watch .while the idea behind the movie is good ,  it could have been more entertaing ,  dramatic ,  or suspensful .   as another reviewer remarked ,  i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else .   but ,  i did suffer through to the end ,  where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging .  .
heavyweights was a quite a disappointment ,  considering the presence of ben stiller .the movie sheds light on a popular summer camp for fat children that unexpectedly finds itself under different management .   the new administration will make it clear very soon that some major changes are to take place .  .  .the plot and the acting are surprisingly  (  !  )  average ,  while the humor and the dialogues are below average .ben stiller's character ,  a cross between zoolander and dodgeball  ( both being amazing movies )  ,  was unexpectedly plain and bland .as for the rest of the cast ,  this film does not seem to be their thing .though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off .   a shame really .  .  .   no masterpiece here .
i hear this is a good movie ,  but can't play it as the dvd is visibly damaged .   so what about quality control ?   this disc should never have gotten out the door ,  but the odd thing is ,  i ordered 2 dvd's from amazon - different titles ,  both damaged .   are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us ?

can someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles ?   the recent hong kong legends release is crazy :  chinese audio ,  or english audio ,  but no english subtitles !i have the original chinese language/english subtitled  ( the subtitles are imbedded )  version of this movie on a universe vcd and ,  based on the merits of its available chinese audio/english subtitles alone ,  it is a better movie--by magnitudes--than the one ( s )  commercially available to the  ( hapless )  u . s .  market .the english dubbing on this dvd ,  even though well synchronized with the actors' lips ,  takes so much away from the film nevertheless ,  especially its  " chinese-ness ,  "  which is a major reason i enjoy this movie genre .   take ,  for example ,  the scene where our hero first returns to jing woo school after learning of his master's death and sees first senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master .   after handily defeating the challenger ,  first senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the english soundtrack completely  ( and deplorably )  misses .   also ,  at the very end of the u . s .  release film ,  chen says he is going back to his japanese girlfriend .   in the original ,  hong kong release ,  he actually goes off to fight the japanese with the resistance movement .   between these two examples ,  there are many such ,  gross audio mis-cues ;  enough ,  at least ,  to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film :  the best of jet li's filmography ,  and perhaps the best of the  " modern "  martial arts genre ,  period .the same criticism holds true for jet li's the tai chi master  ( released in the u . s .  as the english-dubbed twin warriors )  .   it's an english soundtrack superimposed over a chinese movie ,  often stripping the film of its unique cultural content/identity/nuance ,  forcing the film through an american  " knock-down-shoot-'em-up "  template and reducing the potential for mental  ( as opposed to strictly visceral )  enjoyment to a pitiful minimum .   we end up with a film typically devoid of humor ,  character development and silver screen  " intimacy ,  "  a film precariously out of balance with ,  and far flung from ,  its careful directorial intent .if you value the full content--visible and audible--of chinese martial arts films ,  but lack facility in the host language ,  then the next best thing is a well-subtitled ,  original language version .   and this release clearly is not that--by a long ,  long ,  long shot .
it's amazing how hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to secession mythology ,  from birth of a nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification .  this is a very dull ,  shapeless ,  stilted movie .  i wouldn't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds ,  but since it is above all a piece of propaganda ,  i'm compelled to condemn it as history .  what it presents is the  " war between the states "  version of the civil war ,  in which the gallant southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills and dales ,  their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the north .  there are only two black characters ,  both sentimentally loyal to their southernness and their masters ;  otherwise ,  slavery is beside the point .  the generalship of lee and jackson ,  of course ,  is idolized ,  while the northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools .  the battle scenes are perfectly predictable ;  guys charge on foot ,  other guys shoot ,  the fields are littered with bodies .  wouldn't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting ?  how real is it to show only one train ,  and that southern ,  in a war won more by transportation than by musketry ?  if you are a believer in the myth of the lost cause and the justice of secession ,  if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the war wasn't really about slavery ,  then i challenge you honor !  i defy you to read just one heavy ,  scholarly book ,  arguing about slavery by william lee miller ,  a professor at the university of virginia .  it retells the debates that occurred in the house of representatives ,  over slavery ,  in the 1830s ,  twenty-five years before the election of lincoln .  the uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the civil war had deeper roots than you thought ,  and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides ,  blue and grey
lately im getting bored with most of the movies that come out ,  ot it's me that im losing the charm for watching movies .  .  .  and it more into the first one .  .  .i bought this one ,  'cause i thought it was gonna be great .  good critics ,  good   reviews .i finally watched it .  and i thought it was some slasher film .  some kinda that .  .  .  and i was totally wrong .  .  .  some witch movie that i hated .  .  .i could rate it less ,  but well i'll give it a second chance tonight
when shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang .  but saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks .  now dont get me wrong ,  it was funny ,  i'll give it that ,  that's the only reason it got 2 stars ,  but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure in living color wise .  so i'd recomend this for the series collectors like me .  meaning i have season 1-4 and although i didnt like season 5 ,  i'd feel uncomplete without it
after 40 minutes of objective viewing ,  and shot after superfluous shot ,  i sat through another 30 minutes in pain .  i've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either peter jackson can only do epics wheather it calls for it or not ,  or lotr in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for jacksons from higher-ups .  kong is not an epic ,  it is a tragedy .  tell me to watch the whole thing ,  if you will ,  but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in ,  i don't need to .  on another note .  jurassic park had better cgi than this .  mr .  jackson ,  no more 'epic fly-by shots please .
well ,  my title says it all .  there is nothing special or amazing about this movie .  i don't like the three main actors ,  and the ending was just laughable .  sorry ,  but it was a stupid movie
thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low-budget .
the last time i saw the names  " adam goldberg "  and  " giovanni ribisi "  together ,  they were two american soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain private ryan .goldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long .   at times towards the end i was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to  " memento "  or something of that nature .   what this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels ,  that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution .   some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning .   despite a stellar cast that besides rabisi also features jason lee ,  christina ricci ,  vince vaughn ,  haylie duff and elvis costello ,  it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey .rabisi stars as gray evans ,  a movie star actor who is having marital trouble .   gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set ,  going through fan email ,  and getting bugged by people ,  that a fan is stalking him .   relentless in his obsession of this belief ,  he starts obsessing about others around him .   great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales .   we understand that gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time ,  of being the stalker ,  but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring .   the ideas are there ,  i just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all .   the sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing ,  and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat .if you like independent films ,  or want to try something different ,  by all means give it a try .   i don't see it as being something i would watch again ,  or have in my collection for killing time on a sunday afternoon with
unfocused ,  repetitive ,  and worst of all - boring !   what should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame .   ronnie earle ,  the district attorney at the center of the film ,  says ,    " this isn't about democrats and republicans ,  this is about cops and robbers .  "  if only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say .  instead ,  from the start ,  the big buy feels like a film you've walked into thirty minutes late .  following the theme stated by earle of cops and robbers ,  the big buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic ,  but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won't notice .  somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story ,  to bad it's not being told here .
this really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book ,  if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject .  i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out ,  and i accept that ,  but to completely change the ending is not excusable .  what was wrong with the way the book ended ?  like i said if you havent read the book you will like this movie although they do solve these very complex puzzles after a glance at them ( even though they hide a very very valuable secret that will change the world )  .  if you havent read the book or seen the movie do yourself a favor and pick up a copy ,  its a better story and its cheaper if bought in the paperback ,  if you dont have time to read it then get it on audio disk or tape
yes !i agree with the other reviewers !this is the one vandamm movie i love and when i found it in my one used shop i was so extatic i never looked to see screen format !  i never though that it would be full screen@ ! # ! * ! % !  !  !  !  !ye gods !it totally ruins that wonderful sceen in the kitchen of him doing the splits !hey ya i'm a red-blooded female .  .  . and i can go ouch at that scene too !  that stunt hurts to do and man .  .  .  .  . whistle .  .  .  .  . looks very nice !the cropping really really ruins the impressive impact of that scene and i've not see the picture since it first came outit was really a disappointment when i saw full screencome on universal !  !  !we want wide screen !full picture !  !  !  !this is a fantastic action picture and a crying shame to see it in full screen only !  !  !  !  !
ladder 49 was not the type of film i expected-- i was hoping for a good ,  fast-paced action flick ,  which i got for about the first 5 minutes .  the remainder of the 30 minutes that i watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter's first days at the station .someone looking for drama and a story about the growth of a firefighter would probably like this movie .  however ,  those looking for action should probably look elsewhere
the kit was not worth its price .  the spatial effect is poor .  i've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red-blue paper glasses .   no ,  i don't have visual problem ,  and i rigged up everything correctly .the dvds itself were not interesting .  my kids were not impressed much .  it were not made me happier with the pack .sorry this review seems against the others ,  but it is my truth .  i've stored it back into the box .i don't recommend this for you
whatever ills are in the world ,  it's all the fault of the corporations .  that's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie .  for example ,  instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work ,  they forget that these people's alternatives are even worse and that's why they took that job in the first place !   these jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and ,  if they chose that job freely ,  it must be their best option ,  no matter how crazy it seems to us .  as people's skills rise ,  as opportunities increase over time  ( by having more corporations and not less ,  to create more competition for these people's labor )  ,  and as the country becomes wealthier ,  these people's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact ,  the wages of the whole country on the average .   there are no shortcuts to his .   a famous story comes from nepal where anti-child labor laws ,  at the urging of the un ,  turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs ,  as sad as it may be ,  were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families .   it's a slow process ,  but all the industrialized nations went through that process .   government-mandated  " shortcuts "  usually produce results which are even worse .   however ,  the results speak for themselves :  in very short period of time ,  for example ,  hundrds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty in china ,  india and around the world thanks for the  " evil "  capalism & its corporations .   no other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in china and india alone .   also ,  cost of living is very low there ,  so these pennies really can go a long way ,  don't measure it to the cost of living in the west .   what is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people ?  i guess to let people starve to death ,  then the makers of this movie don't have have anyting to complain about !  ?   other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who's a psychopath .   a corpoartion is a legal entity yes ,  and may act like a separate  " being "  as far the law in concerned ,  but does a corporation have a nose ,  feet ,  stomach ?  can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis ?  of course ,  not ,  than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it ?  ?   several of the main  " spokepersons "  in the movie ,  chomsky ,  michael moore ,  rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have no basis in any kind of economics or reality .   to correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie ,  you'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are .   throughout the whole movie ,  you're basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with very little of the other side presented ,  despite the director's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 & 1/2 ,  it's more like 80%-20% )  .   just look at chomsky's comments about how the consumers are so stupid ,  they don't realize that all the things they buy they don't really need .  i mean we don't need fashionable clothes  ( hey ,  let's all dress as boring as chomsky !  )  ,  dvd players ,  or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun .   who is the judge of what you really need ?   chomsky ,  of course .  he is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don't .  you're too stupid to know what you want ,  according to him .  he says that you should do  " more important things "  ,  like .  .  . perhaps studying lingistics  ( which he teaches but which very few care about )  .   the movie does make some correct and good observations ,  especially regarding polution ,  however ,  i'd say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed .  it's also full of economic fallacies .  it's worth watching i guess ,  just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie .   despite all the ranting in the movie ,  it fails to mention the biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life .   for examples ,  how could a government of brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water !  how could the u . s .  government do so many things for private companies with public funds ?   just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies ,  forbid government corporate welfare of any kind ,  forbid subsidies to companies ,  cut the suffocating red tape and regulation  ( esp .  in developing countries but in the west too )  ,  cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10%  ( and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing ,  give people all around the world a better life ,  increase competition ,  etc .  )   if these and other governments  ( and not corporations' )  problems were eliminated ,  the vast majority of all the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away .   an interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile  ( spoken about with much admiration )  ,  people with no understanding about economics ,  how the world really works and how to really raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for .
this is not a good movie !   bad acting ,  story ,  and picture !   i was hoping this would be the first anime of the 8man after dvd i had but alass it was not .   pass on this one unless u have 2 have it
this director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art .  artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about .   speaking russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort .
of course the criterion collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer .  the problem is the film itself .preston sturges made some genuinely profound films such as the lady eve ,  unfaithfully yours ,  and hail the conquering hero that are rich and complex experiences .  but sullivan's travels is   simplistic ,  pretentious ,  and false .as the film's characters themselves point out ,  poverty is only intersting to the rich ,  whose view of it is distorted .  odd-faced character actors in dingy sets make a rich man's view of poverty and not at all related to the real thing .  sturges was one of the most highly-paid men in america ,  so his view of the subject matter is  ( like characters say in the film )  based on cliche .the climax with its chain-gang laughing at a cartoon ,  is pretty dopey and a fairly unconvincing argument for comedy .  sturges would do better to point to how comedy in his best films allows him to examine self-deception ,  angry love ,  role playing and a host of other themes--in other words how humor gets into the darkest and most ambigous areas of human life that  " serious "  drama cannot so easily reach .this film is exactly the kind of film that sullivan wants to make--which is why it is so overearnest and uninteresting .if you want to see the genious of preston sturges ,  watch any of his other films  ( even harold diddlebock )  in their entirety .  after the first 10 minutes a simplemindedness takes over sullivan's travels that make makes it a dispiriting film .
warning :  spoilers .  opening scene is quite shocking .   some graphic effects .   there is more male nudity and male genitalia than female .   there is only one quick .  .  . very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning ,  or  " end "  of the movie .   since the movie begins with the  " ending scene "  and ends with the  " opening scene "  .   the rape scene is violent ,  with graphic language .   obviously actual penetration is achieved  ( anal )  .  .  . but none shown .   not even a good boob shot .   you  " of course "  see the male genitalia  ( big deal )  !movie is revenge driven .  .  . and that seems to be about it .   doesn't have a great script .  .  . may be good to the french .  .  . but ,  not to us standards .   movie is in french with english subtitles .
since we know there is another version of  " burn "  out there , i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes . com and get an idea of its quality . you can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan , poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued . brando told larry king it was his favorite film ; not if he saw this package
when i first saw this cheezy flick at a summer midnight madness film festival twenty-some years ago , i honestly thought it was a joke . i mean , the young people in this 1938 b/w film almost make ward and june cleaver look cool . 1938 , is this right ? the three stooges were still new at that time . if parents truly wish for their off-spring to avoid blowing weed , they may not want to choose to show them this dvd . it's so hard to take seriously . thank goodness there aren't any 'extra features' here . i don't think i could've taken it . 'reefer .  .  . ' does have a sole purpose , to watch maybe every two years after dark when there isn't any thing good on tv
for what purpose these lies about the life of this man ?  are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie ?  if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest .  hurricane carter is not and was not that man .facts :in the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell .  they want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it .  fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times !in a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved .  fact ,  giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape .  the depitction is another lie .another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder .  fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights .  as carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people .  while in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic .  yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america .  shame .norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this .  denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash .  those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care ;  they just like the message .  looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet .  america bashing and race baiting is alive and well ,  earning oscars and making for big box office .  a shame .
this dvd exposes the ultimate warrior as 25% postitive and 75% negative .i do believe that jim hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis .   just another case of a wreslter who couldn't seperate himself from the character ,  and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges .   the only thing that bothers me is that jim hellwig wasn't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions .   he was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact .   jim hellwig declined ,  & used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit .this guy did make an impact in the wrestling world ,  but it was too shortlived .   fans can chalk it up as a cool memory ,  but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with flair ,  piper ,  hogan ,  and the most respected of all the undertaker
i was not happy with this purchase .   this video only taught 10 min .  of teaching followed by 30 min of a porn flick at the end .   the teaching was informative balanced with different women with various shapes and builds ,  i could have used more teaching and less of a porn show .   this was a waste of money !   there are a few more reviews like mine so take our advise .
i give this film one star for the acting ,  which is often very good .  however ,  the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness ,  and debase every aspect of lower income ,  urban people .  in all honesty ,  i've seen more joy in an african famine .  i sat through this film ,  against my better judgement .  still ,  if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty ,  then i recommend  " a streetcar named desire "  ,   " kids "  ,   " last exit to brooklyn "  ,  and  " traffic "  .
i got this movie on sale a couple years ago .   it looked pretty good ,  but you know how most of that goes .   i really lke movies like scream ,  i thought it would be like that ,  but nope .   this movie was a hundred percent perdictable .   i knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie .   from the first seen you can tell it's gonna suck .   *spoiler* the first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway ,  when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out .   the lights flicker  ( wow how original )  and a person .  .  .  in a really ,  really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax .   this is what happens throughout the entire movie .   don't waste your time or money .   if you really want to see it i would suggest renting it .  .  .  not worth more than 3 . 00 anytime
i just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter .   i was disappointed with the 4 dollars i spent on it for that .   it is more like a music video than a story .   the segments are of adults ,  no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much .   sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and i am so glad i didn't buy it .   i really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now i'm sorry that we did even that .   stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy .   i hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were .
this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade ,  with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic .   fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of why i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind ,  but it was a mess .
there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as eye for an eye .   it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised .   they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end ,  whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end .   it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort ,  but for this critic it is getting old .   eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film .   from the opening credits of this film ,  you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end .   the pauses could be guessed ,  the lines could have been written the night before ,  and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best .   it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic ,  the violins would always shrill around kiefer ,  and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere .   this is your typical revenge film with no excitement ,  no frills ,  nothing that would make it stand out from the rest .   the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films ,  which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end .where did eye for an eye go wrong ?   i don't think i need to count all the ways for you ,  but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters .   i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic .   what was sally field's job ?   i know that is a small detail ,  but it better highlights my complaint that our central family  ( the mccanns )  were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen .   i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death ,  yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed .   ed harris literally walked through his character ,  proving that field's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion .   the only character worth watching ,  and was developed briefly ,  was kiefer .   he was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end .   yet ,  we didn't even know that much about him either  ( which upset me )  .   schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well ,  the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably didn't even need to read the script ,  and the story played it safe from the beginning ,  but it wasn't what i wanted to see .   i expected film like this to come out during the 80s ,  not in 1996 .   it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris ,  sally field ,  phillip baker hall ,  keith david ,  and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan .   nothing stood out in this film ,  nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it ,  and nothing made me feel excited about these actors .   this was a literal  " nothing "  film .   it lent nothing to the cinematic world except  ( and i stress this a bit )  another peg in a very tired genre known as the  " revenge thriller "  .after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it ,  overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements ,  which made me think of a high school drama production .   it was amateur at best ,  but she said that is why directors use sally ,  because she is known for being overly dramatic .   this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly .   sally saw success with it once ,  but as she continues it only creates bad cinema .   there were times during sally's bigger speeches that i found myself laughing .   i couldn't help myself ,  but her focus on certain words and clich� reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike .   the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the outlaying father any further in films .   he was completely wasted in this film .   was there any emotion with him ?   i didn't see any .   then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue ,  but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes .   also ,  did mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clich� ?   urg ,  his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers .   again ,  the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil ,  but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile .   it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end .if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself .   field over dramatized the entire film ,  thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer .   did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil ?   that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel ,  but alas ,  ole safe schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path .   i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups ,  but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers .   this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored .   i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast ,  yet we chose to stay on the lighted path .   that ,  coupled with the poor acting ,  just created a film that didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world .overall ,  in case it wasn't obvious ,  this wasn't a good movie at all .   in fact ,  i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again .   i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again ,  but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the  " revenge thrill "  fell into that same pattern .   the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure ,  this film did not .   sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight ,  while everyone else was forgettable .   the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil .   watch this film for kiefer ,  but nothing else .   skip it !grade :  * out of ****
robert wiene's  " the cabinet of dr .  caligari "  is a celebrated work of german expressionism .   while there are several interesting facets to it ,  this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success .francis  ( friedrich feher )  relays a strange story .   a man named dr .  caligari  ( werner krauss )  once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival .   the exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named cesare  ( conrad veidt )  .   strange happenings then ensued after cesare predicted the death of one of francis's friends .   concerned for the safety of his beloved jane  ( lil dagover )  ,  francis took it upon himself to determine whether caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events .in a strange way ,  one can look upon  " the cabinet of dr .  caligari "  as a bizarre version of  " the wizard of oz "   ( 1939 )  .   the framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity .   yet ,  despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation ,   " the cabinet of dr .  caligari "  is stiff and dreary .   the characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in .   give  " the cabinet of dr .  caligari "  points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed ,  but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar .
when buying a product ,  you expect a little bang for your buck .  unlike its counterpart family classics ,  action classics leaves far short of its mark .   although these movies are old ,  you expect quality .  unfortunately ,  the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy .  you'd think that because they're on dvd ,  the quality would be better .  the movies shown are low budget  ( b movies ) with unknown actors and limited action .  need i continue  ?  ?inaction in this case would be best served .save your money for better things .  .  .  like a hot fudge sundae  !  !  !
unless you are an avid bird watcher and need resource material for north american bird sounds ,  this dvd is otherwise a waste of money .   spend the extra money and buy  " the life of birds "
here we go again .  another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots .  the differences between season 3 and this drivel are staggering .they must have swapped out writers or something .  how else do you explain the camera lingering on lana lang's many revealing showers for no reason ?  let me say this as clearly as i can :  showing skin on smallville doesn't work !  !good points :  michael rosenbaum is still the best lex luthor ever put on film .  sarah carter as alicia baker is back !  she's clark kent's interim girlfriend ,  like a psycho lori lemaris  ( who cares if she tried to slice n' dice lana last season and it makes no sense for clark to be within 50 miles of her ?  i don't )  .  there are two new supporting characters this time ,  lois and ,  erm .  .  . jason .  i weep for jensen ackles .  he's way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role .  the way he takes a dumbly-inserted character like lana's new boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something .  erica durance as lois :  easily the worst actress ,  and her lines don't help .  i don't really mind ,  because erica looks like lois ,  even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese grater-level annoyance .  i think lois would work better if she just stayed in metropolis and we saw her only through chloe .  but i guess it's cheaper to keep her on the regular set .  personally i think it's a conspiracy to give allison mack less screen time .  why doesn't she get a revealing shower ?  bah .****things that make my brain hurt : ****1 .  )   clark  ( somehow )  becomes a quarterback for the football team .  you get to see it for five episodes .  what drama .  ok ,  this is just stupid .  he's cheating ,  ok ?  ?  it's cheating .  he can't just switch off his powers when he wants to .  clark's football career also results in the episode  " recruit "  ,  which is hazardous to your health .2 .  )   turns out lana's part-witch .  i thought she was native american ?  nah ,  just french .  and a cringe-worthy villain .3 .  )   producer :   " hey ,  doesn't this show remind you of charmed ?  ?  writer :   " not really ,  but great idea !  !  lets dress lois ,  lana ,  and chloe is corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers !  "4 .  )   if the writers weren't going to keep jason around for more than one season ,  why put him in the credits ?  ?  durr .5 .  )   jane seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in tv history .  she does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck .  bye .6 .  )   'jynx' ,  'spell' ,  'recruit' ,  'sacred' ,  'spirit' and 'ageless' .  oh right ,  and 'forever' .  all lame !  they make me ashamed to watch the show !  some are so awful i don't think i've ever watched them more than once .  that's like half the dvd set .  bah .oooohh ,  i wonder if clark and lana are gonna get together this season !  just they like get together and break up every season !  i'm on pins and needles !the only things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes .  oh yeah ,  hey writers ,  stop ripping off other successful shows and movies !  morons
i was thrilled when i first read that mlb productions was finally issuing a dvd version of highlights of the baltimore orioles' three world series victories .   i already owned the vhs versions ,  one of which  ( the 1970 world series )  had a major flaw in the audio synchronization  ( watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film )  .   finally ,  i could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 world series .much to my dismay ,  the mlb logo is permanently ,  and obtrusively ,  displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs .   what's that all about ?   does mlb productions think i'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills ?   thank goodness i don't own a plasma tv or i'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years !sound and picture quality are okay otherwise .   but .  .  .  . that logo is really annoying
joel hershman's  " greenfingers "  ,  starring the now-famous  ( and utterly gorgeous )  clive owen and helen mirren ,  is a sweet ,  cutesy ,  and utterly empty british romantic comedy .   in this forgettable ,  generic chick-flick ,  inmates at a british minimum-security prison take up gardening .   initially ,  they are understandably reluctant to garden .   but ,  get this ,  gardening ends up changing their lives !   and ,  after his parole ,  owen's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden !   and mirren's character is so impressed with the innmates' gardening that she even has them garden for her !   wow ,  where do people get this stuff ?of course ,  this being a  " romantic comedy "  and all ,  there is a romance between owen and mirren's daughter that is so incredibly forced ,  awkward ,  and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other .   in addition ,  peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed  " uplifting moments "  .   and none of it works .for all its good intentions ,   " greenfingers "  is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates' rooms .  it's all perfectly decent ,  perfectly inoffensive ,  and perfectly dull
this dvd was horrible .  i didn't know what to expect .  .  .  but after the first 10 minutes i was thinking .  .  .  is this it ?  !  what's going on ?  where are they ?  what am i watching ?  after awhile i clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary .  .  .  nothing .  they don't even tell you where they are ?  !  it's basically a 45 minute music video .  and the music ,  although i like it ,  doesn't fit with the footage at all .  i really don't understand the point of this project .  i watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding .  total waste of time and money .  and i am a jack johnson fan
okay ,  it's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion .   it does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis .   on the other hand ,  the film lacks true suspense .   i was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn .   the baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum .   the pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn't stand up that well today .   the actors who took part in this didn't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel .   why there was a sequel is beyond me .   i recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but i was only five at the time .   at the most this is a rent not a buy .   i guess good for it's time but perhaps a re-make would pump some needed life into the story .
you ,  me and dupree is a formula film ,  a template designed for teenage guys who feel the need for potty mouth ,  noisy ,  crude guy things movies .   there have been a lot of these films of late  ( all spinoffs of the wedding crasher image )  and one wonders if there is a saturation point .relating the story is rather pointless as it is a one-line joke  (  ?  )  .   dupree  ( owen wilson playing owen wilson )  is the best man at his buddy matt dillon's wedding to kate hudson  ( the you and me )  and subsequently moves in with them ,  causing all manner of mayhem and bad taste and faux pas and grim situations  ( think toilet problems etc )  .   and that is it .   michael douglas was brought in to play a flat role as kate hudson's father who objects to her marriage blah blah blah .  ask directors anthony and joe russo for the rest .we know that hudson ,  dillon and douglas have much better roles to offer  ( wilson seems to have found his niche )  ,  and the only reason films like this keep getting made is because they make money  ( for some reason )  at the box office .   the film is silly ,  tacky ,  tired and should only be rented if the shelves in the video store are otherwise empty .  .  .    grady harp ,  november 06
i really enjoyed season 1 but from the look of this we're never going to see other complete seasons released .  why release the best of seasons 8 ,  9 ,  & 10 when you've never released the complete seasons ?   what about complete seasons 2 , 3 , 4 ,  etc .  cabana chat with rodney dangerfield ?  phil lamarr's impressions of michael jackson ,  prince ?  little hassan taylor's greatest hits ?  darlene mcbride ?  vancome halloween ?  the  " wash me "  video parody of alanis morissette ?   " lick my baby back behind "  video parody of britney spears ?  the  " love muffin "  video parody of mariah carey ?  the bush cheney rap video parody .  the ubs man goes to the video rental shop ,  etc .  ?  afropuffs cereal ?  the early madtv was a little savage at times but that's what made it funny .  i feel it's appropriate to issue the best after you've put out the complete seasons .  of course maybe there were legal problems .  some of the humor was pretty savage !  i guess if you can find it in syndication then make your own .
this movie is the most boring ,  uninteresting piece of garbage i have everwasted my money on .  the plot is stupid ,  the characters are dull and insipid ,  and the whole movie leaves you asking ,  as the credits run ,   " so what ?  "  don't waste your money !
i started liking this movie ,  i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out ,  if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal  " underground "  cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late .  .  . if you like the depressing ,  gritty ,  wild ,  fastpaced style of this movie ,  check out the original master robert crumb ,  toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of .  .  . this is crap in noncomformity ,  and dont say i  " didnt get it "  ,  i just think hes being hugely self-indulgent and this whole thing is an homage gone awry ,  lacking the wit ,  psychedelia ,  and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly .
the central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920's robin hood and his band of gangsters .  unfortunately ,  even the rat pack cannot save this movie .  the script is slow ,  dated , and dull .  barbara rush's scenes are especially confusing .  her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie .  nothing comes of her apparent interest in sinatra or martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut .  the main actors seemed to be bored ,  and with the exceptions of bing crosby and peter falk ,  walked through their performances .   ( maybe they were hung over most of the time ?  )save your money and borrow it from your local library .
are you kidding me !  ?   this movie is beyond all redemption .   sean conery is a disgrace to himself ,  running around in a red diaper with pirate boots on .   wtf !   what's with all the naked women in this thing ?   why do they have to be naked ?   they're hideous looking in the face and body .   my god ,  my eyes !   if this is the product of the  " love "  generation and what they found to be entertaining and mindfully stimulating ,  no wonder our society is crazy .   i just can't get over how profoundly corny and simple the plot and effects are ,  it's downright insulting to the human brain .   whoever wrote this and was crazy enough to finance it ,  should be killed and then studied so we don't have another idiot of this caliber spawned
while some movies require that you throw out your disbelief ,  i had a very hard time doing so with this movie .   this movie was just plain stupid .   they should have kept this film story in the states .   once everything moves over to tokyo ,  the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which i haven't seen in a long time .   i would have respected the film 1 , 000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to japan .so let's get this straight ,  japanese high school students act like american high school students ?   lucas black's character is simply told to go to a japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do ?   everybody speaks english  ?  his father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment ?i would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt ,  looked and sounded more japanese .   japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet .   the japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful ,  polite and dutiful .   real japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here .   actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed ,  they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true japanese culture .   japanese culture is not steeped in american hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many americans will see this film and actually think that japanese students are just like american students .   there would be nothing further from the truth .   japanese students do not act ,  look or sound like what was filmed here .   not by a long shot .given my dislike of how the japanese culture was handled in this film ,  it left me finding the plot irrelevant .   the plot was ok but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of japanese culture or kept the story in the states .
this has not aged well .  the scripts are silly ,  the acting is of the  " chewing up the scenery "  variety .  gale storm no longer seems cute ;  she comes across as annoyingly perky .  spend your money on something else
don't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity .  if you do ,  you are in for a fall .  both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining .  this one has no such pretensions .  it is merely boring .the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town's folk out of their claims .  they do this through intimidation and violence .  when a couple of friends get hold of a claim ,  they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys .  to do this ,  they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction .  they yell ,  they fight ,  they wrestle ,  they shoot and then they do it some more .  its not very exciting cinema .this production is made worse by the dvd .  i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair .  the dvd ,  however ,  is of such low quality that who could really tell ?  the edges are clipped off ,  the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it .  it was not worth the effort .spaghetti westerns can be fun .  this one ,  however ,  needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn .
i'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at amazon and beyond .  there really wasn't much here i liked .  the soundtrack was the usual  " pap "  you'd expect from a family friendly movie ,  though the sets were nice .  it seems this movie was just miscast .  mel just doesn't do comedy all that well ,  at least for a lead role .  jame garner ,  the reason i bought this seems more like a bystander .  and jodie is jodie and i never bought for a moment she was her character .although the cast is a powerhouse  ( on paper )  ,  sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball .  an example :  there was a sequence when bret asks his friends  ( who are standing behind him )  to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting ;  which as it turns out they are unable to do .  instead jodie and james ,  blow madly ,  just like the movie .this movie reminds me a hell of a lot like ''the three amigo's'' ;  on paper you would think it couldn't miss ,  but on film it's painful to watch
i think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy i don't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim ,  especially about how it's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character ?   but being in a liberal arts college i have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following .   the characters and the situations remind me of the short stories i would write in the sixth grade when i was around 12 years old ,  where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb ,  absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating ,  inane nonsense .   the whole movie feels like ones 12-year-old self trying to write about adult problems that they're distanced from yet infatuated by .   this movie appeals to the type of people who like to read catcher and the rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their chain-smoking ,  wannabe-depressed but more like  " i'm so sad 'cause i don't have a girlfriend "  indie-rocker lives into some sort of literary wellspring .   i think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing ,  it's unfortunate he can't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic  " subtle "  messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say .   hipster drivel - look for something else to watch
i cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we've seen in films like  " baby boy "  .  almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word .  he didn't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance .  i don't know what this film was about .  there are parts where there is a long silence with no talking .  the whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house .there are a few scenes where the characters are running around  without any obvious aim .  the film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying ,   " what was all that excitement about ?  "
there's lots of passion in wide sargasso sea the book ,  but it's mostly emotional .  it's an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master .  the film on the other hand is just your classic ,  bad 1990s film ,  beautiful to look at ,  with lots of skin ,  languid copulation ,  heaving bosoms ,  bodice-ripping nonsense ,  etc and next to no substance .  it has no artistic integrity whatsoever ,  as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the jean rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did .i was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character .  the much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe ,  and it also lacked much enthusiasm .  they were incomplete and contributed little ,  if anything ,  to the plot .  the viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between edward and antoinette .  therefore ,  they should have either gone all the way ,  tastefully  ( no pun intended )  ,  or have left those scenes out entirely .now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes ,  which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book .  but for those who haven't read the book ,  there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat .  from the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family  ( despite the narration )  .  why did the ex-slaves keep laughing ?   ( something vaguely explained in the movie ,  though apparently fully explained in the book )  .  why didn't the parrot fly away ?  what made the mother go nuts ?  at no point in the movie were mr .  rochester's  " issues "  ,  as it were ,  fully explained .  the man gets a letter exposing his wife as a creole and dumps her like a hot potato ,  after  ( as christophene explains )  he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place .  what a hypocrite .  again ,  maybe this is the ultimate point ,  that mr .  rochester is a snob and the archetypical victorian englishman and that antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the jamaicans .  but none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film .so ,  despite the beautiful cinematography ,  this movie is a hopeless muddle .  i'd highly recommend the novel by the way :  a book you don't forget in a hurry .  needless to say i think you should give this insulting  ( to the memory of jean rhys )  film a miss ,  especially if you've read the novel :  it'll just frustrate you ,  no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time .
first of all ,  1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks .   second of all ,  i missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain .   also ,  regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises ,  it is still moderately difficult
this is my number one most overrated movie of all time .   we saw it at a pretensious artsy theater ,  along with an assortment of ex-hippies and wooly haired intellectuals .   they all cheered ,  of course ,  when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water ,  then becomes the chief .   the truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable ,  given the politically correct theme .   the truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture .   the truth is that tradition is not inherently evil .   the truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys .   basically ,  if you hate men ,  this is the flick for you .   but it is not good .   it is not creative .   there are no surprises .   there is just nothing there .   as i edit this ,  it's no surprise to find so few people liked this review .   there are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so-and-so's out there
whatever possessed jessica lange to appear in this mess will never be known .   the payoff at the end is a huge disappointment .   jessica lange tries hard to bring the material up to her level but the script does her in .   gwyneth paltrow is unbelievably bad .   but i think this is not their fault .   the screenplay and direction could have been better .   this could have been a very good movie along the lines of  " misery "  or  " fatal attraction "  but it fails in every department .   as i said ,  the payoff at the end is a real disappointment .   this film is a waste of time and money .   stay away from it !
this dvd is edited from the original version .   this movie is hot ,  the cut dvd is not
.  . i recently purchased the first  " house "  movie ,  i remember watching it as a kid ,  it was apparently alot scarier during my adolesence ,  anyways the second one came with it for free ,  and i must say it was garbage ,  i did not have the patience to sit thru this crap ,  i now use this dvd disc as a cup coaster . peace
this review is based on the differences between the standard dvd disc and the superbit version only .   based on that ,  i recommend that you save your money and get the standard version .   you'll get more features ,  while barely losing any audio or video quality ,  which is the whole reason for buying a superbit disc in the first place .   i've watched this movie on my 40 "  lcd sony xbr bravia  ( 720 dpi )  ,  an oppo upscaling dvd player ,  and 5 . 1 sound system ,  and for this movie ,  i didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version .   so unless they're selling this superbit version for 10 bucks or less  ( which seems to be the trend since superbit discs may become moot now that hd dvd and blu-ray discs are starting to come out )  ,  i'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie ,  which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers
this is his absolute worst videos ,  not his best .   you are missing tons of classic moments such as :   when doves cry ,  let's go crazy ,  mountains ,  girls and boys ,  batdance ,  partyman ,  scandalous ,  automatic ,  why you wanna treat me so bad ?  ,  sexuality ,  i wish u heaven ,  glam slam ,  anotherloverholenyohead ,  america ,  and thieves in the temple .   this is a crime .   when is the real dvd coming out
wasted talent .   none of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying .   some funny stuff .   craig ferguson can do better .   charlotte church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte .   every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters
i don`t like it a whole lot , but it`s pretty good ! i liked the older elmo movies better than this one
i am a bbc devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic bbc storytelling and visual feasting .    however ,  i was only partially correct .   it is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly .  i left the film feeling robbed ,  disappointed ,  sad ,  and a bit unfulfilled .   i viewed it only once and then sold it on e-bay at a cut-rate price .do yourself a favor and save your time and money
this is the kind of morbid/vulger trash that warner brothers does now .   with them it's a show that is full of sex ,  graphic content ,  and a life style that is really damging to one's mental and physical health .   this show and it's studio are no better then disney and their desperate housewives show that treats women like call girls .   it's all represents a hollywood that is out of control and completely gone off the edge .   i condem them both
bearing in mind that the 50 movie pack line is what it is ,  no-frills packages of public-domain films ,  i have to say that sci fi classics is not up to the level of mystery classics and horror classics ,  which i also own .   i've watched everything in the mystery and horror sets ,  and ,  while the latter is padded with flicks that properly belong in the former ,  i didn't feel cheated by either .   moreover ,  some of the films included ,  such as detour ,  impact ,  bluebeard ,  and too late for tears ,  actually are classics of a sort ,  deserving of repeated viewings .only about 36 of the 50 films included in sci fi classics remotely qualify as science fiction or even as  " sci fi "  -- and the only  " classics "  among them are famous  ( or infamous )  anti-masterpieces on the order of robot monster ,  teenagers from outer space ,  mesa of lost women ,  and santa claus conquers the martians ;  the balance comprises sword-and-sandal strongman epics ,  e . g .  ,  hercules and the tyrant of babylon ,  and jungle epics ,  e . g .  ,  white pongo ,  queen of the amazons ,  and clyde beatty's lost jungle .   if you simply must have copies of low-budget programmers such as unknown world ,  horrors of spider island ,  and the incredible petrified world on hand for those occasions when the day the earth stood still doesn't ring your chimes ,  you'll like this package .   otherwise ,  beware
the first butterfly effect is one of my all-time favorite movies .  with that in mind ,  i eagerly started watching be2 .  within the first 5 minutes it became clear that i was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie .  but after finishing it ,  it was clear that i would have to flat-out lie to do that .there is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie :  erica durance naked .  but it's too softcore ,  short ,  and pointless to really be worth anything .the writing is terrible .  the story is lifted directly from the original ,  only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion .  it manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical ,  a feat unparelleled in modern film .  the protagonist comes off as an idiotic ,  self-concerned ,  petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with .  the acting is .  .  . barely passable ,  for the most part ,  but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express .the first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this ?  would this one be the last ?  in the sequel ,  this is gone ,  but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting .if you have any fond memories of the first one ,  avoid this turd
it's so silly how michael moore is criticized purely based on what trashy fox news watchers see on tv .   they claim that his works are fictious anti american jabble ,  when in reality he encourages people to pirate the movie & then goes on tour giving speeches full of well researched facts for free .   clearly ,  this man is doing it all for the money .if his words are so insincere ,  why has the president not sued him for slander ?and why can't anyone slamming the movie ever make any specific reference ?  it's always a general statement about michael moore being one explictive or another ,  and never about something he actually says .   could it be ,  maybe ,  that they don't even know why they hate him
almost unbelievably bad ,  except i saw the remake of 'shaft , ' which should have been a forewarning .   this is like a comic book for filmgoers .   no ,  not a graphic novel adapted to the screen .   more like a comic book for kids ,  that you'd be embarassed to own at any age .   doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack ,  a travesty to the nth degree .
i was very disappointed in this dvd .   it was a dvd for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds .   the dvd was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details .   the ability to view details of color and details of wing ,  tail bands ,  etc would have offered a much better learning tool .   it also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations
this movie was a weak effort by capra ,  who directed it ,  and the star ,  gary cooper .  it's a good story ,  just poorly directed  ( capra can't hit a home run every time )  .  i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on .  and no extra features on the dvd ,  at least none to speak of
these 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in chinese cinema and definetly for jet li and movie kung fu .however ,  i watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which doesn't have english subs  (  i don't mind ,  but every other dvd i have ever seen has this  )also ,  in the first ten minutes ,  there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations .  for some reason ,  cousin yi is now aunt 13 and chu's bird is now chu's beard .  this is crap .  do not buy this ,  buy the movies seperately ,  you can probably find them each for 9 bucks ,  and they would be more satisfying that way
gina is just like the protesters--she just doesn't  " get it !  "  the liberal way of doing anything is throw more of our tax money at it !  whereas africa's problems including poverty & aids will never be solved until they get the birth rate down !  as long as more babies are born than people dying ,  their population goes up--very bad .  the only way to eliminate poverty is less children !  !  send money for that but nothing else .
well ,  nice cinematography as set-designer work :  nicely interiors and well dressed actors .  maybe ,  visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once ,  but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year ,  as other reviewers trying to assure
i was a fan of house ( the first of the series )  and so purchased the combo dvd set of house and house 2 .   i watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while house is pretty good ,  house 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on .   it is really quite dumb ,  but some of the creatures ( i . e .   " catter-dog "  as i like to call him )  are kind of fun to see .   i would suggest skipping the second house unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be ; -
i love love love this movie ,  but you have to make sure you get the vhs version  ( where the vhs cover is the cast riding in the car .  )  lucky for me ,  this is the one i own .  by mistake ,  i purchased the  " wrong "  version for a friend and we sat down to watch it together .  the music in the dvd version is terrible compared to the original  ( don't even get me started on the c . d .  soundtrack .  )  whoever made the blunder of re-doing this for dvd re-release needs to be fired
there is not enough footage on the feud with macho man randy savage .  i prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story .  what did the macho man think about it ?  unfortunately we can never get to hear from ms elizabeth .  would these be included in a future macho man dvd set ?  i was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy ,  especially in front of a huge live audience including kids .  i was totally shocked when i first saw that on tv back in the 80's .  yes ,  that's hardcore .  deadly scary hardcore !  that should not happen in the first place .  the story involving steamboat is well covered .  it is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be .  it is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing .  there should be a line which should not be crossed .  how can a real heavyweight guitar be used by honky tonk to hit jake over the head ?  human error ?  hm .  .  .  nowadays tripe h is using a hammer to hit others on the head .  i guess a guitar is not a big deal by today's standard .  enough is enough .  we don't need accidents !  they may be an unevitable part of sports ,  but not part of  " entertainment .  "
completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth .  stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not ,  having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen .  we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play .  watching the first fifteen minutes of  " heads ,  heads ,  heads ,  heads ,  heads ,  heads ,  heads ,  heads ,  heads ,  "  is colossal torture ,  like status elipticus .  it's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen .  having hopes it might pick up ,  that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever .  a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums .  don't take my word for it ,  watch it yourself and see .
i can't give it any less than one star but what the heck ,  the girls were hot so there's the one star .  other than that i am literally dumber after watching this movie !  i swear to god !  i passed out after watching this film because i got so stupid i forgot to breathe !  they should stop beating around the bush and hire retards from the mental home to play the lead roles because lord knows they would have done a better job !  even if they just ran around the set yelling  " 1 , 2 , 3 ,  potato salad ,  march !  "  the dialogue would have been 1000 times better .  message to the producer :give it up loser !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !
delmer daves' mediocre direction of the sequel to the equally pathetic film  " the robe "  starring richard burton .   a totally contrived film that demonstrates no competence in either screenplay ,  direction ,  acting ,  or historical accuracy of any sort .   avoid at all costs unless you're expecting to see it as a comedy .compared to kubrik's incredible direction for 'spartacus' a few years later ,  the gladiatorial scenes in this film are second rate .  even the low budget film 'barabas' with anthony quinn had better direction than this worthless film .   the screenplay is contrived ,  the script is worthless ,  and the acting utterly shallow from everyone on this film :  at least 'the robe' had richard burton .   victor mature continues to act as if he just came out of a cocktail lounge after a few martinis too many .   jay robinson continues his idiotic and ridiculous performance of caligula as if the character were a retarded bufoon instead of the diabolical genius of cruelty and perversion  ( see hurt's performance in the bbc's 'i ,  claudius' to see how a good actor handles this character .  )   in short ,  reading the new testament or going to a church sermon is far more entertaining and historically faithful than watching this garbage film .   just the fact that victor 'manure' is in this film says it all .ignore this pathetic film and watch 'spartacus' ,  'barabas' ,  or even the fantasized 'gladiator' for some good gladiatorial films .   as for biblical films ,  'ben hur' ,  'the ten commandments' or 'quo vadis' are films that are worth watching much more than this putrid hollywood junk .
i normally praise disney's animated movies ,  but i've got to draw the line somewhere .  i can't believe the average review for this movie was 41/2 stars .  i found the characters in this movie annoying ,  even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff .  i urge you to buy treasure planet ,  any disney pixar film , tarzan before this one
this is a very slow movie and it seems more like a documental about war ,  geopolitics and weapons trade .  there is almost no dialogues
i love stargate ,  and give the movie 5 stars .  i own a vhs copy ,  and have watched it many times .with that said this  " ultimate edition "  is not ultimate at all .  there are no real special features .  the documentary is a cheesy one that explores if there is a real stargate ,  but there are no .  .  . no .  .  . behind the scenes/making of star gate insights at all .  this documentary has nothing to do with the cast/crew/design/production of the movie .  this does not ,  by any means ,  make this dvd ultimate .  this dvd edition isn't ultimate at all ,  but extremely mediocre .the only special feature on this disk is a producer/director audio commentary that can run during the movie .  that's it .  really .  no kidding
this is just like an updated b movie from the sixties and i enjoyed it .   it's real comic book stuff .   the effects are not bad ,  the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it's easy viewing .   i enjoyed this more than big budget films such as evolution or jurassic park 3 .   but i think the absence of big names will put people off ,  not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job .   and if big names don't matter to you then you could do a lot worse than watch this
this is one bad movies .  i am a devout horror fan ,  but i was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie .   the acting is worse than bad ,  it's a joke .   the plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous .   save your money .    even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive .    there is no humor ,  no likable characters ,  not even a decent quote or one liner .    by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion ,  you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back .    so save yourself disappointment and keep looking ,  this movie is the biggest bomb ,  i have stumnbled across in years .
perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of lincoln's various works ,  such as the sacred place ,  the messianic legacy ,  and holy blood ,  holy grail ,  or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books .  the dvd will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books .however ,  it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about the da vinci code .  the narrator ,  mr .  lincoln ,  takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the languedoc ,  home to the cathar heresy and the albigensian crusade ,  and points out some interesting details in his wandering .  yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture ,  and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture .  as well ,  he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals  ( many inspired ,  it would seem ,  by lincoln's books )  and repeatedly editorializes against their actions .  i finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---i cannot imagine what else mr .  lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour .
i will not watch the movie  " andersonville "  until they make a movie called  " elmira "  ( the camp in elmira ,  n . y .  ,  the worst of the union prison camps had 35% death rate )
even though i would agree that  " erin brockovich "  is an entertaining movie ,  julia roberts performance in it is no more oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in  " pretty woman .  "   i am second to no one in enjoying a good  " david and goliath "  story ,  but this movie has such shaky roots in reality ,  it is more of a tall tale ,  than the  " true "  story of a historic class action suit that ,  i would imagine ,  left more unhappy plaintiffs ,  than it did satisfied ones .   however ,  as the movie title implies ,  this is indeed erin brockovich's story ,  in the same way that the  " xena "  character is the main attraction in  " xena :  warrior princess "   ( though it should be noted that xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the erin brockovich character )  .erin brockovich is a vain ,  brassy ,  boorish ,  single mother of three young children ,  with no marketable work skills ,  a transparently opportunistic manner ,  who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character roberts played in  " pretty woman "   ( prior to richard gere's character taking her on the infamous rodeo drive shopping spree )  .   the movie's beginning finds erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident ;  her lawsuit is lost ,  primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony  ( swearing ,  cursing and shrieking from the witness stand )  while being questioned by opposing counsel .    unbelievably ,  erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's  ( played by albert finney )  firm ,  mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk .    later ,  while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill ,  pro bono ,  real estate sale ,  erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records ,  that ,  for reasons she  ( correctly )  does not understand ,  seem to be of particular interest to the buyer ,  the mega utility company ,  pacific gas and electric .   erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that pg&e had  ( for decades )  negligently contaminated the ground water  ( surrounding one of their power plants in/near hinkley ,  ca on the edge of the mojave desert )  with toxic ,  hexavalent chromium .   this discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits  ( at least in terms of the award )  ,  in which hundreds of hinkley residents sue pg&e  ( by and through the representation of erin's boss )  in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs .roberts gives a photogenic ,  if not especially gifted ,  performance in her role as erin .  the movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of roberts  ( literally gushing out skin-tight ,  low-cut ,  bustier-inspired  " work clothes "  that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet )  as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated hinkley residents .  while there is much to be said for erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit ,  she is not an especially likeable character ;  rather ,  she is rude ,  verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests .albert finney is considerably more appealing and believable as ed masry ,  the aged and  weary attorney who is erin's boss .   the bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing ;  unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work ,  the focus for these scenes seems to be more on roberts  ( strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy ,  five-inched-heeled mules )  than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters .   aaron eckhart plays the affable ,  gentle biker and next-door-neighbor ,  george ,  who becomes erin's boyfriend-by-convenience .   the  " convenience "  factor is totally one-sided and for erin's benefit exclusively ;  she  unabashedly uses george for free ,  live-in childcare ,  thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist masry as they put together the historic case .   erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar  " bonus "  check   ( from masry )  when the tort action case settles ;  contrastingly ,  george gets a  " thanks "  for his nanny services from erin and his walking papers .the plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life ,  who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant .   though the hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed ,  make no mistake-this movie is about erin brockovich  ( indeed ,  i do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present )  and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening ,  generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face ,  due to the toxicity in their water source .   erin brockovich is presented to the viewing audience  ( in typical hollywood fashion )  as a sort of heroine ;  but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people ,  walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich .   is the movie entertaining-absolutely .    inspiring- not even slightly .
i agree with others !  season by season box sets of beavis & butt-head are what we fans want !  with all music and b&b commentary and no damned edits of anything !until then ,  mike judge & company ,  i will not buy anything b&b related ,  relying instead on my own vhs recorded episodes ( limited in number of episodes as they are at least they're the complete original episodes ) that i've transfered to dvd .i want each and every episode uncut and in their original broadcast order .who's the brains behind the lame  " mike judge collection "  series anyway ?  !  ?  some dumbass idiot working at burger world ?  ?  ?just from a purely greedy standpoint you'd make way more greenbacks by doing it the right way for cryin' out loud !  not to mention retain the show's and your integrity .hell ,  even beavis and butt-head'd think this  " collection "  concept'd be lame and stupid !  !get with the groove mike & co .  and give us what we want already !  !
i saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl i was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too .  to this day , i pray i don't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average mexican-american again .  as a mexican-american who has worked hard to take the right road in life , i was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic .  do we really need to come out with a movie for all of america to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race ?  prison sex ?  babies drinking beer ?  young kids doing a drive by ?  mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa ?  please !  !  !  !  wake up mexicans-americans !  we need some positivity !  !  !  !  !  edward james olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message .  what message ?  that doing the things shown in this movie are bad ?  i think we knew that already !  what surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on amazon that this movie got .  this of course means that no matter how much sense i have made , it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful .  p . s .  .  .  . let us not forget that i am not the only one who thinks negative about this film .  several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual ( s )  out there who found the movie offensive .  edward james olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie .  adios amigos !  !  !
i saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies i have seen during the last two years .  stupid ,  stupid and stupid .  ryan reynolds becomes annoying .if you have brain ,  never watch this movi
pass on this one .  the original was ok ,  but if you want great music ,  great dancing ,  awesome sets ,  truly celtic--even with the huge ego of michael flatley ,  who is ,  by the way an extraordinary talent ,  buy his show  " feet of flames "  totally toe-tapping awesome .  this will be no disappointment like the so called  " best of riverdance "  it has no spanish dance ,  no spirituals ,  no hip-hop ,  no russian dance .  all well and good for many .  but feet of flames is totally irish & celtic ,  whichever you want to call it .   emma killingbeck  scots&irish to the cor
ok ,  i've only just seen this film for the first time ,  so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect ,  but this is not a particularly good film .i mean ,  it has its choice moments where it really comes together .  the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed .  any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status .  samuel jackson's in it .  and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character ,  the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity .but that's really my problem with this film .  serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting .  and they're all here :  the homey black grandparents ,  the nation of islam convert ,  the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road .  .  .  all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth .take the french film 'la haine' ,  for instance .  it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society ,  boyz n tha hood ,  etc .  ,  but its characters actually feel tormented ,  instead of just having lots of scenes written for them to show their torment .  rather than just running through a laundry list of problems ,  one-by-one ,  scene-by-scene ,  it really gets to the heart of something bigger ,  some grander alienation that urban youths feel ,  which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do .  plus ,  if you can believe it ,  the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better .so while i would definitely recommend seeing this film ,  keep the remote aimed and ready ,  finger on the fast-forward button .  maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching ,  whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising .  oh yeah ,  and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason .  oh ,  also ,  the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees .  in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight ,  that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking ,  but it really just cheapens this one
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth .  the facts are there in parts and pieces ,  but it was not really put together well .  some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic .  this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased ,  and i think it failed at it's overall agenda .  there is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do .  if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond ,  we are truly in trouble .  the truth is out there ,  and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together .  there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd ,  but this dvd is maybe worth a glance ,  but not a long hard look .
from a big jt ,  brit ,  and x-tina fan :   this dvd is soooo disappointing .   the dvd is comprised of whole episodes of mmc- and very little of the episodes has britney ,  justin ,  or christina featured .   there is only one song where brit and justin sing  ( a duet )  ,  and only one where christina sings .   other than that ,  all they basically show are lame  " hometown profiles "  which last about 60 seconds each .   you get better content from a  " behind the music "  or  " driven "  episode .    there's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely nothing to do with britney ,  justin ,  or christina .   lame ,  lame ,  lame ,  and disappointing .   i think the total on-screen time of real content is about 12 minutes .   save your money
love the movie ,  but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch .  the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up .  if you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off ,  wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
i own several real wheels movies and thought i would give this one a shot .   i found the picture quality to be less than i expected and the footage seemed out of date .   the narration was dull and boring ,  and the children's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying .   i would recommend any of the  real wheels series instead of this - they never fail to please my 3 1/2 year old truck lover
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known hollywood cliche in film making . i applaud the effort . the chicks in this film are happening babes fo sho . but there ain't much to the film but it has some fun to it
i bought this dvd hoping that it will be a good one but it turned out to be awful and trashy .  there is no story or plot to it ,  so i ended up throwing it away .  i really regret buying it .if you're into sex ,  then this film is for you but let me tell you this ,  it is boring like hell .
i enjoy the initial season of murder she wrote very much .   my wife and i are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to who dun it .   frequently ,  though ,  it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up .   often the audio gets out of synch with the video .   terrible !   we surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons ,  but now -- about 3/4 the way through ,  i think we'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided dvd's
this movie is basically about 12 yr .  old boys crying with each other .   when does that ever happen ?   the dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids .   what 12 yr .  old worries about  "  .  . never getting out of this small town .  "  ?i guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends ,  then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense .   i have a feeling oprah would like this movie .
this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you wouldn't miss anything and might even enjoy it .  unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i couldn't wait for it to end .   i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was .  at least a quarter of them walked out before the end .  it's that bad .  it's a shame ,  i love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
it is hard to believe that the same team that made gettysburg made this verbose waste of time .   this movie almost guarantees that the last full measure will never be filmed and that is a shame .it was a mistake to take stephen lang and put him in the role of jackson .   jackson was considered ,  even by his contemporaries ,  a military genius but crazy by half .   the film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty .   lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be shakespearean .   the prayer scene in the morning ?  puke !   it could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching ,  or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene .most of the  " women "  folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded ,  and i hate to say it but i was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever i was glad to be rid of her .   her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor .   i get it jackson was  " such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual "  give me a break ,  i hate being force feed like that .   a better director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly .then there is chamberlain quoting shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares .there is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film .   i would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been .   a narrative like gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige .if you must see it borrow it ,  rent it ,  but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart .gettysburg is much better .   i actually missed sheen and i hate that guy
having been a teenager once ,  i can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience .   however ,  in pump up the volume ,  the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens .   the teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior .   even our hero  ( well played by christian slater )  cannot communicate with people on a one to one level ;  he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them .   as a proponent of truth ,  he is a vapid antithesis of truth :  he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths ;  he doesn't use his real name or voice ;  and on a call with a potential suicide victim ,  he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation .   the suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure ,  but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise ?   the adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes .   sorry ,  folks ,  been there done that .  .  . living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right .   questioning authority without any viable alternatives ,  as none of these teens do ,  merely escalates the generational gap ,  and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth
i give this film one star for the acting ,  which is often very good .  however ,  the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness ,  and debase every aspect of lower income ,  urban people .  in all honesty ,  i've seen more joy in an african famine .  i sat through this film ,  against my better judgement .  still ,  if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty ,  then i recommend  " a streetcar named desire "  ,   " kids "  ,   " last exit to brooklyn "  ,  and  " traffic "  .
li is no heavy-weight pianist .  neither is bunin or even zimerman .  and don't foeget that chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all .  and judging from the steam and progess li has made ,  lang lang's position is certainly under threat .  and any viewer who is interested in li or how chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this-- here we have to thank martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the chopin competition .  now in his mid-twenties ,  and musically out of almost nowhere ,  li is already a full fledged musician .of course ,  viewers should not compare him with arrau's fine balance between the extreme high and rather low register ;  or his scales with richter's .   this is not fair ,  for arrau and richter are such great artists .  li is already so close to zimerman now .furthermore ,  what we hear may have more to do with the accoustics of the hall ,  something which has more to do with the engineers than the performer himself .  and i say so because i'm a bit concerned about the quality of the picture of this dvd .  it appears to me more like a vcd than dvd production  ( or somewhere in between )  :  it is slightly below average dg production and the camerawork is also average only .  this is obviously not fair to a blossoming career that li is now having .  one star is taken for want of a better production .
i first saw the movie poster and wasn't particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler .  but then i heard composer alan menken  ( who had worked on beauty & the beast and aladdin )  was attached and this made me rethink my position .  then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before .  still ,  i went into the movie theater ready to give  " home on the range "  a chance .  .  ..  .  . and fell asleep .  i found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak .  i admit the animation is fine  ( but not spectacular )  and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between .  apparently  " home on the range "  was meant to be released before  " brother bear "  but because of story issues it was delayed .  i don't think it should have been made in the first place .  it has also ruined the work laid out by  " brother bear "  for a new disney renaissance .  i think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired ,  because not only is it terrible ,  but it ended mainstream 2-d animation for disney ,  a massive loss to the entertainment industry .the dvd has an audio commentary  ( with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster )  .  there is also a behind the scenes featurette ,  games ,  art review and music video- more than this movie that never should have happened deserves .
this truly is a horrible movie .   7 seconds ,  huh ,  yeah 7 seconds to realize i made a mistake in renting it .   the acting is horrible ,  the plot is horrible ,  the filming is horrible .  .  .   everything is horrible !   i was hopeful because of snipes ,  which is why i rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters .   the guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie !   snipes couldn't even do the fight scenes and make them look real .   the ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love !   huh ,  they were a romantic interest ?   they hinted at it ,  but never showed this happening .do not rent or buy this movie .   stay away ,  or you will be sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie
don't bother wasting your time with this movie ,  instead read the book .   the book was one of the best i have ever read ,  the movie left me wanting .   i rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through .   so maybe i am being unfair since i did not watch the whole movie ,  but honestly i couldn't ,  it just didn't do the story justice
director :   gary fledercast :   michael douglas ,  sean bean ,  brittany murphy ,  skye mccole bartusiask ,  guy torry ,  jennifer esposito ,  shawn doyle ,  victor argo ,  conrad goode ,  paul schulze ,  lance reddick ,  famke janssen .running time :   113 minutesrated r for violence ,  including some gruesome images ,  and language .every fall ,  hollywood trots out their latest thrillers ,  attempting to cash in on the college crowd who wants to bring their dates to a dark theater and take advantage of the squeamishness of the content on the screen ;  there is a hidden connection in the biting of nails and the changing of the leaves ,  yet without fail every year there are enough thrillers to keep manicurists in business .  nothing sums up the quintessential fall thriller quite like  " don't say a word "  ,  a suspense romp as routine as they come .   diverting enough to fool you into a good time ,   " don't say a word "  makes one wish for a leap in time to the holiday oscar contenders already .   dr .  nathan conrad  ( michael douglas )  is a successful psychiatrist with a beautiful wife  ( famke janssen )  and a cherubic daughter .  on thanksgiving morning ,  a group of bad guys ,  lead by patrick koster  ( sean bean )  ,  break into nathan's apartment and kidnap his daughter .  what the men want is a jewel they lost 10 years earlier in a botched robbery that is being held in a secret place by elisabeth burrows  ( brittany murphy )  ,  a mentally unstable young girl rotting away in a hospital .  since nathan seems to be the only medical professional she trusts ,  patrick uses him as a pawn to recover the jewel .  nathan is soon at the mercy of the kidnappers ,  but as he gets deeper into elisabeth's mind ,  he realizes the young girl could be helped after all .it's perfect casting to place michael douglas in the lead role ,  as no one could play yuppie paranoia quite like he can .  douglas has perfected this type of performance into an art form with his work in  " fatal attraction "  and  " a perfect murder ;  douglas is a little more subdued than normal in this film ,  as his aging seems to be wearing away his ability to play the hot ,  rich stud who gets in over his head .  the film does contain many moments of pure distressed douglas  ( his forte )  ,  with his hair glistening ,  teeth clenched and his eyes scanning the room ,  etc .  douglas ,  at least in the first act of the film ,  makes an attempt to carry the picture with his expected bag of tricks .  soon enough ,  director gary fleder places too much narrative nonsense on douglas's shoulders ,  and the actor eventually just gives up and lets the genre's conventions take him to the safety of the end credits .   director gary fleder is no stranger to the fall thriller game ,  having directed both  " kiss the girls "  and the rollicking  " things to do in denver when you're dead .  "  not really an imaginative director ,  fleder nevertheless can be counted on to get the job done .  with  " don't say a word ,  "  fleder isn't working with a particularly good script ,  so he falls back on what has worked for him before .  this plan of attack from fleder leaves the picture stale and overtly familiar .  the film is not interested in adding new elements to the plot to keep things at least appearing fresh .  the end result making  " don't say a word "  more boring than exciting .the thriller ,  which is set in new york city ,  uses the city and apartment locations well ,  creating a nice sense of claustrophobia .  it is when the action suddenly leaves the confines of the city and moves to a cemetery in a nearby island that the picture loses quite a bit of tension and interest .  moving to an obviously-a-soundstage cemetery ruins the fun of seeing the character freak out in their narrow apartments and office spaces .  the film must end with a clichd showdown ,  which is the reason for the move to a different location ,  but fleder makes a big mistake taking the story away from the grip of the big bad city .   the one element that fleder does get right is the casting of actress brittany murphy .  a powderkeg of emotions ,  murphy is the perfect choice to play the deranged elisabeth .  murphy is a grand talent  ( where is her emmy for her voice work as luanne platter on  " king of the hill "  ?  )  ,  and the only actress in hollywood that truly achieves success as both a tormented patient and a cute ,  little princess  (  " just married "  ,   " uptown girls "  )  .  unpredictable and bristling with untapped passions ,  murphy makes a vivid impression in  " don't say a word .  "   you've seen this type of film before ,  and just because it's the time of year when apples taste the best doesn't make this barely alive thriller any more enjoyable .  for fans of the genre ,   " don't say a word "  is another solid installment in the michael douglas versus new york crime saga .  just don't expect any surprises
don't waste your time .  i usually give low budget horror a chance and i have an open mind ,  but this movie is utterly ridiculous .
maybe for some people ,  to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal ,  but in matt sullivan's case ,  it could be a total nightmare .after his girlfriend nicole leaves him ,  matt spends about six months devouring girls ,  until he starts to hallucinate .  advised by his brother ,  matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems ,  and proposes to go through lent without sex .for matt's friends ,  this odyssey is as absurd as impossible ,  and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last matt's abstinence .  he doesn't have it easy ,  as many temptations will make him suffer ,  and even smell the possibility of a new love .40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character .  in a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years ,  this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love .  oh .  what a shocking discovery !
well folks ,  looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here .   (  " crash "  comes close ,  but that film has a lot more detractors than this one ,  and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined ,  somehow ,  that it would  " change the world "  .  )   my beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film :   i don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse ,  nor do i find it overly depressing .   fact is ,  it isn't depressing at all cause i didn't care .   it's just boring and annoying ,  sometimes at different moments ,  sometimes simultaneously .   this not a good combination .all right ,  here's a plot summary :   jared leto ,  marlon wayans ,  jennifer connelly and ellen burstyn all do drugs ,  and this really messes up their lives .  i hate to give it all away like that ,  but there it is .   the fundamental flaw is this :  i don't like any of these people ,  so their pain doesn't mean anything ,  and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect .   maybe if aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked ,  but now there just isn't anything there .   as far as what's actually in the movie ,  we've got  jared leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly ,  who wants to be a fashion designer ,  or something .   beyond this we've got jared's mother ,  ellen burstyn ,  who is a weird old woman and marlon wayans as leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues .   i particularly love how there's no real attempt to make wayans into a person .   he's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it .   the doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three .   he at least displays a little life .   connelly and leto apparently just wandered here from a bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely .    ( well ,  connelly actually does coke ,  i think ,  but it fails to liven her up any .   also ,  i actually *like* the bergman films i've seen ,  so that's not really a fair comparison .  )   they love each other ,  apparently ,  but since i don't even like either of them i'm not much interested .   finally ,  burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end .   perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if i cared about her ,  but we've been over that .  .  .and i want you people to know that i'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies .   i can care about the characters ,  but none of these people did anything for me ,  so the movie's dead in the water .   for good counter examples watch  " trainspotting "  ,  which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and  " bubba ho-tep "  ,  a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it .   on the other hand ,  neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as  " requiem for a dream "  ,  so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego .   still ,  if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose ." requiem for a dream "  isn't helped any by darren aronofsky's repetitive ,  derivative over-direction .   the trouble is ,  this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is .   there's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics ,  but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground ,  as we see fast-motion a thousand times ,  quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk ,  and they are ,  again ,  impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in .   i imagine that the overdone ,  repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use ,  but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch .   the score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over .truth be told ,  i thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half ,  but then it really started to grate on me .   it became evident that no ,  aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no ,  these characters weren't going to get any more interesting .   i looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film ,  and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective .   it was kind of uplifting ,  really :   now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom i can go do something else .   now that's a good ending .grade :  d+ps this is 500 reviews .   i doubt if i will write 500 more ,  but who knows
ok ,  this movied is a favorite .  having said that ,  i am less than blown away by this new transfer .  still looks a bit dull to me .  it's a fun set though .  getting the box was a no-brainer .  am i the only one who's missing the poster offer ?  a sticker on the outside claims that the offer is to be found within .  well i don't see it .  .
first off ,  let me say that this is a great collection of really bad sci-fi movies .  the selection spans several sub-genres of the classic sci-fi age .  you've got gamera movies ,  hercules movies ,  outer space movies .  the whole gamut .unfortunately ,  the sound is very bad and the movies are not closed captioned .  as an individual with a hearing problem ,  the soundtrack was almost indecipherable due to the constant hum that permeates most of the transfers .  the video is also problematic ,  but no where near as bad as the sound
well ,  this dvd is pretty bad ,  like everyone else said .  it's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14 ,  with narration from each character in the background .  i believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren't getting high ratings on the anime series .  anyway ,  i didn't buy this dvd ,  because i have the japanese box set instead ,  which saved me a lot of $$ .  i watched each episode ,  and i must say the only part i liked was the opening and ending theme .  other than that ,  there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan .  but ,  don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window .  i really highly recommend renting this before you buy it ,  cause otherwise you are wasting your money
ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie ,  i was estatic .  i marked the movie release date on my calander ,  got my tickets in advance ,  and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater .the movie was a huge dissapointment .  while i wasn't expecting the movie to be just like the book ,  i certainly wasn't expecting that .  while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie ,  i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book .  the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth .i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie ,  it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears ,  despite the fact that i've read it over 100 times
sorry but this movie certainly showed a horrific side of the old west .   sure there were some noble men and victimized young chinese girls ,  but they were way outnumbered by the rotten men and women depicted in the movie .   i do not find very graphic violence ,  nudity ,  and rape on the top of my must watch list .   i skipped to the ending on the second disk
i turned it off after 20 minutes
each scene is one shot ,  and that shot goes on and on and on ,  sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action .   this film is pretension personified ,  but that's okay .   many people can't tell the difference between pretension and art .   the music too is full of squeaks and squawks .   in case you didn't know ,  that means that the music too is high art .there is no story .   boy and girl see each other ,  and without preliminaries hit the sack .   we see boy & girl here ,  there ,  in the sack ,  here ,  there ,  in the sack ,  etc .   occasionally we get a shot of some of the other characters .because of the lack of dynamics ,  the film is not effective ,  either as drama or as eroticism .   ironically ,   " the summer of '42 "  was much more erotic even without any nudity  ( which would have helped )  .the vaulted sex scenes are three in number ,  chest and shoulders ,  and they last about three minutes each .   the much-touted fellatio scene is actually surprisingly good ,  more convincing than the  " love "  scenes .there are also a few brief full-frontal scenes of the star ,  who has a gorgeous body  ( hence ,  the two star rating )  .bottom line :  the only reason to see this movie is the nudity and the sex .   but there are many better movies for that .   so ,  only if you need the pretentiousness in order to permit yourself to see a sex movie should you see this .
funniest movie i've ever watched . i think i busted a rib laughing .
you only need to read the book by whitley strieber to know how truly disappointing this movie is .
" chamber "  was always the worst entry in the harry potter series ,  but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse .  choppy editing ,  horrible humor personified by the untalented rupert grint ,  smug acting by the equally untalented emma watson ,  poor screenwriting by that hack steve kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack chris columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience .skip it if you can .
i'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia .  i had not seen this movie as a child ;  those that say it's faithful to the book must have read something other than lewis carroll's alice .  however ,  the kitsch value is considerable ;  cheezy music and costumes ,  pure 1985 .  that being said ,  the jabberwock was pretty cool in that  " godzilla-man-in-the-rubber-suit "  sort of way .  also ,  the set design was very handsome .  it's too bad that the lighting technology of the time couldn't have been more varied ;  everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional .  the film that comes closest to tenniel's original alice illustrations is the 1933 paramount b & w version ;  it's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on turner classics
i have been a beatles fan since 1964 ,  and i have distinct memories of the band's influence on my young life .   i saw hard day's night ,  help !  ,  yellow submarine ,  and let it be in the theater when they were first released .   this film has always been the holy grail of beatle fandom .now that i own it ,  i can honestly say i understand why it took so long to release it to the public .   that thirty years of isolation ,  locked up in a vault somewhere in london ,  only improved its standing in my imagination ,  not on actual film .   the bbc was right to bury this .   as a film ,  or television special ,  it's horrible .but as a fan ,  i had to have it .   now ,  that's all i can say about it ;  i own it .   when will let it be be released
the uncut version of the anime is much better than what is aired on tv .  though there are still some diferences between the japanese version and what is in the uncut version .  i wouldn't recomend the special edition unless you are a hard core naruto fan .  the bonus items that come with it are mainly geared toward younger viewers and not much towards adult viewrs
unless you enjoy movies that are not funny ,  not scary ,  and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns ,  do not watch this series of horrible flicks .   putrid !   not even  " so-bad-it's-funny "  .  absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind !   heed my warning !   sucks !  !
flat lighting ,  cheap sets and costumes ,  dull dialog ,  wooden acting ,  and a goofy plot ;  even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie .   zero stars should be an option .   for more inspired soft porn ,  check out the work of andrew blake  ( andrewblake . com )
.  .  . has a pretty thin plot .  ice/'cave' man isthawed out by  " rudy "   ( sean astin )  and  ( ass )pauly shore  [ who's  ( bogus ) 'west coast surferrap' has grown pretty lame by now ]  .  brendanfraser is likable in this yet another attemptat pro-evolutionist b . s .  .  .
boring and like most every other new horror movie .  lame mask , i think the awful movie cut used this mask also , who cares i suppose .  this goes with all the other pathetic new era horror movies ( scream , i know what you did , valentine , urban legend , cut etc .  .  )  so bottom line don't waste your time , stick with 80's slashers
this was not very good ,  in my opinion .  the ring scared the bejeezus outta me .  this was not scary .  two weeks afterwards ,  i still find my mind wandering about one thing .  .  . why the heck didn't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room ?  if i walk into my house and see a half-naked boy meowing and hissing at me ,  i'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin
the picture quality is not very good .   it's like watching the videos on an old vhs tape taped off of television .   i've never seen a dvd in my dvd player look so not digital .   the selection is okay ,  the dvd opens playing a small clip of the tears for fears song  " head over heels "  even though that video isn't on the set--but fear not ,  two tears for fears videos are here .   i bought this because i love the level 42 video for  " something about you ,  "  and i figured this was my one shot to get it on dvd .   buy this if you just must have it ,  the price is a bit much for such a short little collection ,  this should really be in the $12 . 99 or less range
in the annals of criterion this has to be one of their most bloated ,  pointless offerings .  this film is just ridiculously bad ,  not fun ,  just kind of depressing to see so much wasted effort on such a pathetic script .  if you really want to watch 1960s willis o'brien-inspired stop motion animation watch anything by harryhausen and call it good .  equinox works only as a curiosity or mystery scince theater 3000 fodder .if you want to see great low-budget southern california filmaking ,  watch  " halloween "
okay ,  the script is not the most imaginative i've ever seen ,  but i like the actors  ( especially ben's best man )  so i was friendly with this movie for the most part .   i didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot ,  such as .  .  . why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones ?  or at least ,  why don't they use them ?   oh no ,  much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to nc .   i didn't even mind the fact that the whole  " we're married and my husband's a doctor .  "  charade was so predictable .  oh gee ,  he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people .  d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and  " dr .  holmes "  might have to step up ?   and uh ,  they're pretending to be married and oh !  surprise there's the best man and maid of honor !  d'ya think they're gonna get busted ?what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending .   it was obviously supposed to be a surprise  ( and it was )  but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience .   i felt cheated .  i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben ,  and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah's little boy and all that .   i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget ,  i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other .   the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen .   right up to the last moment ,  we think he's breaking it off with bridget .  instead ,  what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all .huh ?   he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane !  !  !  after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back .   this man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life ,  and i'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after ?not only that ,  but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously ?   it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us  " don't do it !  "  and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage ,  aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway .   it's just marriage .  it's romantic !  you could get lucky and live happily ever after !it's been my experience ,  when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding ,  turn and run .  the last thing you should do is close your eyes ,  grab your balls and take the leap
this is a potentially very good film .  interesting idea  ( bearing some resemblance to  " angel heart "  )  .  sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer .  i don't think i've ever bought  ( dvd or video )  or seen  ( tv or cinema )  quite such an awful copy of a movie .  it is clearly stuck together from more than one original ,  with the logo  " delta "  appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner ,  but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version .  the term  " special edition "  seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released  !  !  !  !  !  tony curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue  ( clearly from some late night cheap tv series )  .don't buy it .maybe there's a better version  ( i read talk of a  " critereon "  disc )  ,  maybe not .  still ,  it really isn't worth  ( any )  money
this movie is utterly unremarkable -- actually ,  scratch that .   this movie is actually very remarkable -- because of how bad it is .   first of all ,  the protagonist is pathetic :  it's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful ,  weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems ;  all she does is cry and moan .   second ,  the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers i've seen in any movie .   third ,  there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered ,  which disrupt the movie's flow and continuity ;  for example ,  the protagonist gets hit head-on by an 18-wheeler truck ,  and her car is absolutely mangled ,  but she walks away without a scratch .   someone care to explain how that's possible ?i probably would have stopped watching this piss-poor excuse for a movie if i wasn't at a friend's house  ( and there's the fact that it's his movie )  :  i sat through it just to be polite .   when all is said and done ,  this movie just isn't worth your time .   i'm glad i'm not the one who actually paid my hard-earned dollars to buy this piece of dung
i really want to give this piece of garbage a zero .  actually ,  i only watched part of one episode ,  i don't know if it's from season one .  i am a columbo fan ,  and a detective writer .  i saw a sniper shoot a man on a platform .  the platform was almost located right up against a building the sniper was in !  a toilet with flowers in it .  he reacts to colds ?  i saw a classroom full of kids .  every one had a cold !  not very realistic .  kiddie video game pacing ,  with no proper build up .  they don't make stuff for intelligent people anymore !  if you are new to this series ,  watch some before you buy .  maybe some of it is ok .
i hope i can give a fair rating here ,  but as one member who loves to watch lds films of all types ,  this one is a big let-down .  i normally will sit through any movie to see if it gets good .  this one was just overkill that was not even funny .  i initially sqeezed a few laughs out in the beginning but then it looked like  " nursury "  comedy if you know what i mean .  i turned it off after the whole overdrawn toilet scene with the wedding-gown-infomercial-in-a-movie
if you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for  " a beautiful mind "  or even  " lord of the rings "  you've missed the boat .  this movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what's so great about it .  see this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh ,  to gross you out ,  to surprise you with its clever twists of plot ,  to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds ,  and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates' treasures .
i saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him  ( he was seeing it for a second time .  )  after the first ten minutes ,  i wanted to leave .  if you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb american youth from small ,  hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local wal-mart or becoming mince-meat in iraq ,  then this movie is for you !   however ,  if you like movies that actually challenge you to think ,  don't waste your time with this one
sit down under a tree ,  give it a big hug ,  fire up you bong and go to sleep .  that's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie .  it's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci-fi hippie flick .  i'm surprised that freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed .  keep your money say no to drugs !
we saw the movie in the theatre and loved it .  the dvd we just purchased was horrible .  they chopped out so much of the movie it made it un-watchable .  it is only good for a coaster under my drink now
i really enjoy both nathan lane & matthew brodderick .  i'm a marginal fan of will ferrell  ( in this movie ,  i thought he was *way* over the top )  .  and it seems ,  nothing in this movie/musical really gels .i knew nathan lane sings really well ,  and was actually pleasantly surprised at matthew brodericks singing voice .  not pitchy at all - good voice .  but the plot was lame & slow .  the songs didn't flow well .  and ,  i belived it was too much  " stage "  and not enough of a movie .and ,  i didn't really find it that  " dark "   ( even though that's how this movie was advertised )  .  mild satire maybe ,  but nothing near dark .  it's more accurately described as bland !frankly ,  nothing in it worked for me .  it was a big disappointment .  if you're *really* into musicals ,  then you might like it just for the singing - that's the only reason i stuck with it for the first 45 minutes .  maybe my grandparents would like it .  .  .  i don't know .  i'm somewhat confused by the positive reviews here .but i just had to shut it off - there was nothing advancing the plot or the characters ,  so i just didn't care how it ended .1 star for the plot ,  1 . 5 stars for the screenplay ,  2 stars for the singing
i am a big fan of martial arts films  --  having lived in taiwan .   however ,  this one was over-hyped in my opinion .   the love affairs in the dvd were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times .   i often enjoy the melodrama and over-acting of chinese films ,  but i gagged a few times on this one .   it was down-right goofy at times .   i really wanted this one to grab me ,  but it did not .
susan ward , coming out of daytime and primetime soaps on tv ,  gave movie acting a try with this rather lame picture from aol films .     director mary lambert tries and fails to give us a basic instinct story with zero script and while this was a studio pictures ,  it looks like warners gave them a fairly low budget to work with .   as the lack of film sets show .    if you like susan ward ,  then give this a movie a try ,  if you want to hope that she gets better film roles in the future ,  don " t find it here
surprisingly sleaze and chauvinismby female director heckerling !  sheduplicated it in chevy chase vehiclenational lampoon's european vacationtoo !  many child actors got their starthere ,  but the thing that cracked me up ,as i saw it when it came out  ( unfortu-nately )  was the dialog of my fav band ,cheap trick :  ticket scalper  "  .  .  . themagntism of robin zander and thecharisma of rick nielsen .  .  . and whatabout the tunes ,  'i want you to wantme ,  the dream police .  .  . nan-nan-nah ,'you're momma's alright ,  your daddy'salright ,  they just seem a little weird ,surrender ,  surrender .  .  .  "  ,  before he'sinterrupted .  if that isn't somebody'sidea of 'surrender' ,  they've stumbledonto this review by mistake
don't bother .   just don't bother .   it's sad to see
i really did give this a chance but i can't say i like the show .  it focuses more on the  " police "  aspect and less on the science ,  which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there .  i know david caruso has his fans but i just can't appreciate him in this vehicle .  .  .
i like air supply songs .  this dvd is a big disappointment .  sound quality could have been better
the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella - too bad those aren't basinger's legs though .  nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger .  i have never understood ackroyd's characters .  and keeping in form ,  he is once again as unfunny as mud .  basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film ,  but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film .  ok so she munches on batteries ,  and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime .  she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts .  jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script .  however ,  his contribution seems way overstated to me .  he doesn't have much to do .  funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people .  basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do .  think ,  jar-jar blinks .  i suppose it's ok as a backdrop for housecleaning .  but that's it .  flat and mechanical
i actually saw this movie when i was 7 and it freaked me out abit ,  but i mean the brother was basically a blob with a face and the story was as bad as the acting .  the ending was garbage and it had nothing to offer in todays world . dont even rent this ,  i dont even know why you are considering the film .i only give it a 2 star rating because t managed to scare a seven year old and i havent forgot how dumb the film was since .
what a disappointing purchase this was !   i have never purchased a dvd set that was this bad in quality without it being pirated .  actually ,  i've seen vhs copies with better audio/video quality .   if i had not purchased the set from amazon itself i would have thought ,  i did get a cheap bootleg .  the sound is a bit flat ,  which i could deal get over ,  but the picture quality is just horrendous !  all of the episodes are grainy ,  pixilated ,  and some even blur a bit .  there are whole episodes where the show is so dark you can hardly tell what is going on .  it's a waste of money to buy dvd's like this .  shame on fox for releasing them this bad !as for the show itself ,  well ,  it would be kind to say it was okay .  in truth ,  it is not that great .  i wonder how the show made it to season two at all .  the acting was bad ,  the dialog was atrocious ,  the stories were subpar ;  i could go on ,  but i think you get the idea .  usually ,  a shows first season is the best or at the least good enough to make you want to see the next run ,  but not this one .in short ,  do not buy this set even if you are a fan .  you can tape reruns on the fx channel in better quality !
after reading the novel by jane yolen with my 7th grade classes ,  i was eager to view the film version .   i had heard conflicting views of the film- it's great ,  it's horrible ,  etc .   after viewing it for myself ,  i must agree with those who gave it negative reviews .   however ,  despite its lack-luster performance ,  the film did serve a purpose in the classroom .true ,  the film leaves something to be desired .  they change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them .   editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story .   rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely .   major events in the rising action are left out ,  thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing .   overall ,  very few of my students liked the film adaptation of jane yolen's novel ,  which they found so riveting .on a brighter side ,  because of so many differences ,  viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through t-charts and venn diagrams .   it also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills .after reading the novel and viewing the film ,  most of my students agreed that the book was much better- something a reading teacher loves to hear !
boring ,  boring ,  boring .  what a  " let down "  !  it's dated and just not good .  it was torture sitting through this .want a good ss video ,  go with what's the name of that song or the 25th annivesary celebration .  they are great from beginning to end
to enjoy citizen kane ,  you have to be able to answer the question above .  i just hate almost everything about this film .  i think it's easy to create a hype how such a terrible film look great and deep .  many people will fall for it .  but it's very hard to make a truly great film !
seems like this video could be useful ,  but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it ,  yet alone trying to work out to it .  .  .  . some of the moves were cool ,  but all in all i will trade this in for something else
please do not waste your time or money on this much-hyped piece of trash .   not only is harvey walden unconvincing in his role as drill sargeant ,  he lacks passion as is evident by the body language and expressions of the exercisers in the video .   unlike other excercise gurus ,  he does not exercise with you ,  instead he stands on the sidelines and barks out commands .  the production quality is very low budget .   it looks like it was shot using a  camcorder .  the set is bland and melancholy ,  and there is no music !  all you hear is the loud marching of the feet of the exercisers ,  who display no enthusiasm at all .   and ,  i for one ,  can't blame them .   i only hope they got paid for what must have been an extremely painful project for them .  i was never more bored in my life .   walden's cuing is off ,  and furthermore ,  it is difficult to follow an excercise instructor who does not do the moves with you .   that's just crazy .   what was he thinking ?   i have no words to describe how awful this video is .  i wish i could give it 0 stars .   don't waste your money .   please !  !  !  !   the other reviewers must be new to exercise because i can't understand how they couldn't see that this video lacks what an experienced exerciser would expect .  if you want a high-powered ,  energizing ,  effective calorie burning workout you will not like this video at all .  you will be sorely disappointed for sure .   instead try kathy smith's peak fat burning or any one of her step workouts
if this movie was ever going to have a chance ,  it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long ,  or never attempted in the first place .  some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - possession just can't be dealt with that way .  what you have as a result is another story entirely .  there just wasn't time enough ,  i guess ,  to develop the characters ,  or even to include half of them .  the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george .  the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating ,  and we are left with painful stereotypes and ,  in the case of roland michell ,  a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming .  my best advice is that if you've read the book ,  skip the movie ,  but if you saw the movie ,  you should do yourself a favor and get the book
as much as i like paul newman ,  this movie is very disappointing once you've seen the far-superior film  " day one "  .   the portrayal of oppenheimer and groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people .   the movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the manhatten project .be sure to see  " day one "  if you are interested in this ,  and give this film a miss
ok ,  the original is a classic and is what .  .  . 90 .  .  . 100 minutes long ?  jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story .   the native were scary .  the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions ,  they actually made him into a character .  .  . something that can't be said for any of the human characters .the insect scenes are ridiculous !  !  the dinosaur stampede was idiotic .  anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie .  now jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with ?  !  ?peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently . remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics
i felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer .  after about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so i turned it off .
i have been a le carre fan until the end of the cold war .  i somehow still managed to follow him later for some time .  but now it is over ,  definitely .  i disliked this novel ,  and the movie is obnoxious .  rachel weisz is quite ridiculous in her part .  which idiot nominated her for her oscar is beyond the point .  zellweger got an oscar for an even more horrible performance recently ,  in the otherwise quite acceptable cold mountain .  and even the otherwise great blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in the aviator to get one .   ( why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies ?  )my conclusion :  this world is strange .  it has no idea what is good and what not .
this is not a collection of the superbowls ,  played from start to finish ,  as some of the reviewers would lead you to believe .   i got this for my father so he could watch the 49ers tromp all over the broncos over and over again  ( since they certainly haven't been up to much lately !  )  .   unfortunately ,  all we got was a collection of highlights ,  with so many  " up close and personal "  shots ,  that it was almost nauseating to watch on a bigger screen tv .   an expensive disappointment ,  surely
did anyone else watch the same movie that i did ?   or should i say try to watch the same movie that i did ?   i am a huge classic sci-fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one .   i was mislead .   i can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie .   in fact ,  i am sure that carpenter and o'bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past .   the unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring .   the 'effects' don't exist ,  and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing .   it's not funny - it is embarassing .   i could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage
having watched great movies in the bible series such as joseph ,  david ,  abraham ,  jacob ,  moses and samson and delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures ,  i was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film .  what a let down by this anachronism .  how low can one go !  this is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of god .if you do not believe in god ,  have never read the bible ,  particularly genesis but have heard of noah from hearsay ,  perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value ,  a mediocre one at that .if you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of noah's ark ,  don't aggravate yourself .  avoid this movie like a plague .
there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound ,  then they are .  the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable  " crash "  ,  but at least that was  ( somewhat )  assuaged by strong performances .  this -- arguably the worst  " mainstream "  motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing .  an excruciatingly long 2 hours ,  and as much as i  ( usually )  enjoy george clooney ,  i might never forgive him for this drek
dont get me wrong ,  i'm kinda young but i love 80's / 90's movies specially the horror ones .   i had great spectation for early geoge romero movies .  but both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad .  gorge romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry ,  but for today standars they are not ,  even they are not that good for most of the 80's 90's movies .the bad :1 .  acting is not beleavible .  it looks like the were  " acting "2 .  the dialog's are not how people actually talk .3 .  the soldiers at  " day of the dead "  are a shame ,  they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline .  they behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups4 .  more than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other .5 .  i think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans  ( listening music ,  shooting ,   " talking "   )6 .  the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment .  theres is not any frightening atmosfere  .the good :1 .  the gore scenes are really good ,  maybe too much bloody .  it shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated .so far the only great zombie movie i have seen ,  beleive it or not is resident evil 1 .resident evil 1 has it all .  resident evil 2 not .  resident evil 2 is one those  " just shoot and kick "  movies and i'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo .so if you want a gory movie ,  maybe you may like this movie ,  but the gore is just at the end of the movie .  you will be better pleased with  " cabin fever "  .if you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe resident evil 1 ,  poltergeist ,  the original japanese version of the ring and the grouch ,  scarecrows .  alien ,  aliens and even alien 3 not alien 4  ( it sucks )  .but the best review is your own so i recomend you rent them and judge them by your own and decide if the worth the price
i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago .  unfortunately i couldn't find anything about this film i remember enjoying .  it's a cross between the blob ,  the thing and a really crap detective movie .  moriarty's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80's kiddy movie .  this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it .  no suspense ,  few laughs ,  and way to hokey to watch twice .  if you love this movie you need to get out more .
this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies .  gee ,  another movie with a fast-talking ,  potty-mouthed ,  black guy  ( hello eddie murphy )  who ,  because it's perfectly fine in ultra-lib ,  pc hollyweird ,  calls charlie sheen  ( and everyone else who is not black )  a host of nasty ,  racially-oriented names .  the movie is a mess .  let's see .  the protagonist  ( tucker )  plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer ,  is chased around  by cops and the bad guys .  the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds .  sheen is supposed to be a co-star ,  but like most of his other movies ,  he sleepwalks through it .  clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker .  the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along .  first  " screenwriter "  :  "  hey bob ,  what will we have tucker do next ?  hey i know ,  let's have a car chase and have him call some people some names "  second  " screenwriter "   " hey ,  great idea fred ,  i sure don't have any ideas "  .   apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of murphy the trickster flicks .  basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name .  if that's your idea of humor ,  i pity you .
many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege . this is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film . i too loved this movie at a certain period of my life . the period between my birth and when i turned ten . that was when i read the book . the book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created . it has now been awhile since i first read it , but i still remember the excitement i felt with each new chapter . i finished it in a few short hours . since then , i have reread it several times , and each time it has been just as enjoyable . it is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy . my brother reads as little as possible ,  but even he loved it . the movie , on the other hand , has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing . it deters from the book in almost every way possible . it makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting . judy garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine , dorothy gale . in the book , dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever . in the film , she is whiny , cowardly , fretful , and slightly stupid . she is also portrayed as being around fifteen . making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance . besides wrecking the book , this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film . don't misunderstand me , i am a fan of musicals . however , this film made for an atrocious musical . practically every single song was annoying !  !  !  !  ! also , the  " somewhere over the rainbow "  number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book . this brings me to the biggest , most awful , distortion of them all !  !  ! in the book , dorothy really went to oz !  !  !  !  ! not only that , she returned to oz several times in other oz books . eventually , she even moved there to live !  !  ! in making the whole experience a dream , the entire story of oz was destroyed . having said that , this movie receives a 1 in my opinion . even so , i realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom . if they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book , then the 3-disc dvd is the edition to purchase . the features look good and the picture is restored . as for me , i will spend my money on better things .
if this movie were set in the us ,  i would've given it 1 star but the british accent ,  humor ,  and colloquialisms partially saved it .  .  . but not enough ,  sorry to say !why not ?   because despite a few mildly surprising and utterly contrived plot twists here and there ,  this film is still built on a particularly toxic myth :  the desperately lonely and insecure 30-something single woman who is made to be as endearingly pathetic as possible for the audience to root for her inevitable finding by a mr .  right .   here ,  the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby ,  clumsy ,  and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing .almost from the first 5 minutes ,  this movie just reeks of focus-group-inspired audience manipulation as it slogs through the same old trite cliches and recycled tv-sitcom bits .   was there even one half-original character in this whole movie ?   don't remember any .  .  . maybe because i'd like to forget this dreadful cringe-fest of a flick asap
i was optimistic for greg kinnear once .   he was very funny ragging on soap soup .   he usually plays the nice-guy second banana in film or a man dying of aids .   auto focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960's tv icon ,  hogan ,  in hogan's heroes .   the replication of the original cast is a bit eerie .   after all ,  these actors dress up as german prison guards .   a chill goes down my spine ,  but hogan's was a comedy ,  which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny ss guys .   anyhow ,  bob crane played hogan for six years and kinnear badly imitated .   yes ,  i'm sorry to say ,  kinnear is awful as crane ,  which puts a damper on the bio-flick .here's a disc jockey with semi-hip 60's patter on the air with an all american family ,  a loving wife and cute kids .   they live like ozzie and harriet in the la burbs ,  going to catholic church on sunday .   crane lands his big break ,  falling for the trappings of fame .   most people fall for the trappings of fame .   read the supermarket check out magazine racks .   so all of a sudden ,  crane's garage porn collection isn't enough .   women ,  very beautiful ,  hollywood loose-morals women find crane and his buddy william defoe irresistible .   the birth of the video camera comes into play .the trouble with the script or maybe it's the cardboard way kinnear acts ,  we watch ,  but in the end ,  we don't care .
i bought a copy of ntr for one reason and one reason only :  a single scene near the beginning ,  prominently featuring rosanna arquette .  this was the same reason i bought a copy of &quot ; the wrong man&quot ;  ,  starring john lithgow and - rosanna arquette .  discretion prevents my explaining further .  other than the scene already mentioned ,  i found the movie pretty worthless
what do we dowhen first started watching wrestling in my early teens ,  ric flair was a hero of mine ,  he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever .so when this dvd came out i got it immediately ,  hoping to relive my youth ,  but i realized something .  all the matches are the same ,  there long and dull ,  the same moves are done over and over ,  and the matches only pick up when flair opponent takes the advantage .  there is nothing wrong with long matches ,  if that are done well ,  like the iron man match between bret hart and shawn michaels ,  but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long ,  so it can show flairs endurance .i also noticed flair is so repetitive ,  all wrestler use trademark moves ,  but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life ,  for example ,  chop .  .  . woo .  .  . flair flop .  .  . figure four .  .  . cheat .  .  .  . win ,  that not a description of one flair match ,  that's every flair match .  when i started watching wrestling i only saw his wwf matches ,  so it all looked new to me ,  when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are .  other wrestler have put together dvd ,  which shows a variety of different matches such as eddie guerrero ,  chris benito ,  bret hart & shawn michaels ,  all top wrestler adopt to there opponents ,  flair expects his opponents to adopt to him ,  that's way all his matches are the same .the only thing worst then his dvd is his book ,  i lost all respect for flair after a read his book ,  it seem that he is just like hhh and shawn michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face ,  put does it behind their backs .  he bashes mick foley for being a stunt man ,  who only does gimmick matches ,  so what's hhh ,  a guy flair calls great ,  can anyone name a good hhh match that isn't a gimmick match  ( wm x-7 against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight )  .  he says foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player ,  who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles .  he critises bret hart for not putting over shawn michaels at survivors series 97 ,  when he was called upon to job to lex luger before he left who the wwf .  he refused and took the title with him to wwf ,  brining the wcw to its knees .after watching this dvd ,  reading his book ,  and seeing how his using backstage politics at the wwe now ,  to keep himself in the limelight ,  its fair to say the ric flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way i could have won 16 world title if i had my friends booking the show.
mission : impossible ,  the tv series ,  told the adventures of the impossible missions force -- an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins ,  foreign dictators ,  terrorists and others who threatened the security of the united states .  rather than engage in james bond-like shoot outs ,  the imf team worked together to covertly neutralize threats ,  leaving little or no trace of their involvement .  although the imf had a leader  ( steven hill as dan briggs and peter graves as jim phelps )  ,  there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective .  a truly groundbreaking show .along comes brain de palma's catastrophe of a remake ,  starring that couch-jumping scientologist tom cruise .  within half an hour of the film starting ,  the entire imf team ,  save for cruise ,  is killed off ,  jim phelps  ( jon voight )  is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original mission : impossible is shot to hell .  granted ,  ving rhames and jean reno are present as cruise's new team ,  but mission : impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another tom cruise vehicle where he preens and postures .  making a film called mission : impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original tv series .  it's obscene what tom cruise's ego has done to bruce geller's original concept .  this is just another action film with mr .  cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself .  see the original tv series and skip this piece of bastardized trash
this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth .  the facts are there in parts and pieces ,  but it was not really put together well .  some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic .  this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased ,  and i think it failed at it's overall agenda .  there is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do .  if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond ,  we are truly in trouble .  the truth is out there ,  and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together .  there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd ,  but this dvd is maybe worth a glance ,  but not a long hard look .
antonio banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you can't believe he ever got wealthy when he's running around giving money freely to a woman  ( angelina jolie )  who lied to him from the moment they met .   she didn't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl ,  so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry .   well ,  we never get to see the pretty girl ,  because jolie must have killed her too .   the only reason this woman is  " hot "  is because she'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody  ( if you've seen gia ,  you'll know what i mean )  .   neither she or banderas  ( who isn't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent )  have any chemistry ,  and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her .   my guess ?   the age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed ,  and all the sex in this movie gets old fast .   it's so stupid ,  because nobody has interludes like that unless they're shooting a blue movie .   the only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot .you can see right through this silly waste of two hours you'll never get back :   this adaptation from waltz into darkness was remade especially for the purpose of exploiting two celebrities with highly sensual images and nothing more .   this movie is as bad as showgirls and one star less than beyond the valley of the dolls ,  because at least beyond is badly funny in an entertaining way .   not only is their relationship devoid of any true sense of love ,  but you also get this overwhelming desire to see creepy ,  unconvincing billy  ( played horribly by thomas jane )  get the girl .   billy ?   what a stupid name for a bad guy ,  but i guess it wouldn't make a difference even if his name was ralph or percival .early on in the movie ,  the so-called beauty julia/bonnie/i forget what else--wants to see a really bad theater group ,  and a friend of theirs comments on what a cheap mellowdrama is being presented .   my thoughts about original sin exactly .   the plot is stupid ,  and the dialogue is so bad it's over the top .   in the end ,  the movie makes absolutely no sense ,  and you wish you would get a payoff ,  but you don't .   the rat poison doesn't do its job ,  and neither does the executioner .   all i really am sure of is that ,  with all the rape scenes that jolie's horrible character seems to enjoy and her portrayal of a woman who's asking for it constantly ,  that women should find this movie grossly offensive and degrading to our gender ,  and i'm not even a feminist !   as for studmuffin banderas ?   he really has no business in front of a camera because his acting scope is on par with the little boy who was in problem child with john ritter .   however ,  he is a good director  ( crazy in alabama )  .   heed my advice and avoid original sin ;  the two hours you waste on it will be unforgivable .
like other reviewers ,  i found meetthe parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at hollywood so i figured  " why not ?  "well here's why not .  it presents the main character's parents as crude ,  clueless buffoons ,  and having no social judgement whatsoever ,  but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip .  and for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on fantasy island .  i'm surprised they didn't include a sex with a midget scene .  nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former cia agent ,  who was set up as an object of ridicule .  oh ,  and they had to be jewish too .  streisand and hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way .   {  " our people don't shoot ducks ,  dear "  )do former cia agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built rv that would cost at least $250 k ?  the toilet humor and profanity wouldn't have made it into  " dumb and dumber "nothing reedeming or funny here .  fuhgeddaboutit
all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci-fi story with beautiful babes all over the place .   well ,  there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies ,  never materialized .   has the art of  " posing "  been lost by modern girls ?   maybe all the good directors have retired or died !   what a pity .  .  . why ,  i couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end .in spite of my being a certifiable  " dirty old man "  .   [  : - )
the only other ff material i've see is the movie and i didn't play any of the games yet so i'm not basing this review on that .  after watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked .the animation was bland and ugly looking .  the c . g animation which was produced by gonzo was poor and didn't blend in at all .    ( if you want good works by gonzo check out full metal panic ,  vandread ,  hellsing ,  gatekeepers and a few others )  .the plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12 .  2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world .  there they meet a strange man ( strong silent type )  .  each episode goes something like this .  the kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place .  the bad guy ( kid ?  ?  )  sends his minions to where they 3 are .  the man in black shows up ( approx 7 min left in ep )  and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun ( attached to arm ) turns on and he says  " it has moved ?  ?  "  yells  " soil is my power "   ( cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots  )  a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy ,  then he goes away .  the kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over .that happens every single episode and there is very little plot development .  come on at least pokemon has more of a plot .this show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what i understand is not a big  " final fantasy "  demographic .strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it .
this movie didn't do anything for me .  .  . didn't care for the characters or the plot .   the ending was disapointing also .
this is poorly casted and scripted movie ,  has only one thing going for it ,  no annoying chevy chase around to make unfunny jokes ,  he did not have too ,  the cast here do that in abundance
i didn't like this video for several reasons .   the rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands .   i was looking for an aerobic video .   i have gilad - bodies in motion which is great but was getting bored with it since i had it for four years .  let me just say i'm sticking with gilad because denise does nothing for me .   you don't even feel like you had a workout with her .   she's boring .   i would recommend gilad for aerobics and tamilee webb for toning .   tamilee is awesome .    i have many of her videos and i'm a true fan of hers
well ,  i guess i should've read more reviews of this dvd .  it is strictly for beginners .  i don't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up  ( if i do breath of fire it helps )  .  when i want an easy day i'll pop this in and do both sessions .  very simple .  but i'm sure it's good for a beginner--a beginning beginner .  sara ivanhoe is soothing though ,  and encouraging .  but seriously ,  this is a very easy workout
our daughter has weak muscles and i wanted some workout videos we could do as a family to supplement her physical therapy .  i saw all the good reviews and thought this would work for us especially since our girls love bears .   not !   it did not keep their attention and as adults the movie was a tad annoying to us .
this is  [  .  .  .  ]  .  i suppose anybody who'd hire adam sandler and/or tea leone lacks the ability to create anything that we who are descended from cro magnon man could watch .  i lasted 20 minutes .  the  " jokes "  are older than me ,  and they weren't funny when they were born .there is a world that exists nowhere except in american tv and film .  it's an ugly place where nobody acts human ,  preferring to cling to stale stereotypes .  a place where writers without talent set their stories .  a place they grew up watching on american tv and in films ,  thus perpetuating the vicious cycle .  this film is set in that world .  no human being has ever been to this place ,  because it only exists in the minds of hacks .from the writer and director who brought us broadcast news ,  which i reviewed recently .  it ,  too ,  was in the pretend world ,  but that was okay because it was a film about a tv show and it had a bit of wit and perception .  this has none of either .it's a damn shame this is the only way cloris leachman can get work .
not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes ,  it's tantamount to watching old batman episodes .  as soon as something develops ,  in comes the cheesy music .  .  .the added scenes were poorly produced which is why they didn't make the original cut .  .  . the interviews seemed contrived .i'm not impressed .the older version supersedes the new
well if this movie had a story then i must have missed it because there is none no matter how you look at it .  they don't even fully play the 9 songs and the sex scenes are pornographic that's true but it would have made sense if they were within some kind of context and no there is nothing shocking  ( as one of the reviewer declared )  about 2 people having sex .i don't recommend it
my daughters are not barbie doll fans .  .  . but they do like the movies .  so do i .all but this one .  the pegasus were beautiful .  .  . but it stopped there .we thought barbie was too snotty and disrepectful in her manner of speaking .  bring back the nice barbie !her 'boyfriend' was just as snotty .we didn't like the evil wenlock .  .  . and the way he preys on teenage daughters forcing them into marriage .in one scene wenlock throws a tray of food into one of his wives face .  that was shocking and sad .our copy of this dvd went into the trash
maybe because i didn't like porco .  everything was sub-par for me .  animation is definitely not as good as his later movies .  not enough weirdness ,  tried too much for the plot .  everything was just too ho-hum .  as if he tried to carry the whole movie on porco's shoulders .  but once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there .
first off ,  i am a huge pixar fan .  in november in '95 i took my company to see toy story and within 6 months of that showing i got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film .  i've seen every pixar film at least 5o times .  nuff said .anyway ,  i liked the film cars .  .  but not as much as other pixar flicks .  .  its still good .  .however ,  the dvd is underwhelming :  a )  no commentary b )  horrible deleted scenes c )  not much in extras .  the route 66 mini-documentary is ok though .  .this dvd is about as bad as the first release of a bug's life .  .  another skimpy release on dvd .  .finally ,  they didn't include a tribute to joe ranft .  .  that's a huge crime in itself .
i bought this dvd becuase i really wanted to learn the dance moves in  " you got served "  and was extremely disappointed .   the only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those ,  i don't know .   the freestlye section at the end is fun to watch ,  but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video
cheesy instructorthe instructor's voice covers the music in the background which turns you off going on with the exercize ,  the music itself is monotonous and the beat is not inline with the moves .  the instructor is too fast to follow .  . to cut it short i do not recommend this for anyone  .  . totally not professional
having enjoyed lost in translation ,  i thought i might like this one ,  which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why i can't fathom .  the entire plot is self-serving ,  shallow ,  and unrealistic .  i guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values ,  and while i don't condone those ,  the film lacks clear characters or any motivation .  a lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it ,  and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded !  ?since the writer-director gerw up in hollywood ,  she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you .  so the entire premise is false .romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act .  it's not caring ,  not real ,  and not responsible .but i guess that wouldn't bother the rich ,  overfunded daughter of a hollywood genius out to make a name for herself .
next to a night at the roxbury  ( another will ferrell zero )  this is the worst movie i've ever seen .  so maudlin and it dragged on and on and on .  it could actually make the viewer pray for death to end the torture so i guess it has some authenticity .  brad pitt's particularly bad - one facial expression  ( blank )  and a painful monotone delivery .  i think he got some award aptly represented by a carved wooden statue of keanu reeves .  mr .  brangelina jolie looks awful next to a brilliant thespian like anthony hopkins .  bottom line :  this movie stinks and so  ( ironically )  does pitt
do not confuse this with the real thing .  i found teh vhs of this for $1 at a store near me .  i was interested so i got it .  i watch iron chef on the food network evey night ,  and this dosent even begin to hold a candle to it !  the one commentator is a failed comedian ,  and the other is a culinary half wit ! i never heard more ussless facts in a 90min span b4 in my life .  the chefs in the first baattle were ,  for lack of a better term dissrespectful ,  i mean come on how are you gonna have a cell phone on you and answer it during a cooking battle ?  !  ?  they kept cutting away from the cooking to show interview clips with the chefs .  the cooks were pretty good ,  they had a decent talent but we didnt get to see as much of it here as you do on the real show .  there flour reporter keeps bugging them thru out the whole thing ,  asking questionspassed down from the dumb announcer . they kept tryign to play shatner off as a culinary genius but come on we all know that he is nothing but a medeocore actor .  .  .  . out side of star trek or wat ever he was on .  the only you see shatner is when he is talking about clearly prewritten statements that sound kinda incoherant lol .  all in all i give this 2 stars ,  and that purely gose ot the merit of the chefs ,  not to the shows them selfs .  unless your a shatner fanatic ,  or sone won thats just kinnda like  " its cooking ,  i'll watch it "  but be warned .  its not as good as it could be .  glad i only spen $1 on it bc its truely not worth more
kelly preston and tcheky karyo are a new york city couple who come together after preston leaves matthew broderick and karyo uses meg ryan in order to get a visa .  now broderick and ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex's .  the problem is ,  the offenses they've endured  ( being dumped and being used )  don't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people ,  especially karyo .  which is probably why first-time director griffin dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles .  after all ,  how can we not root for ferris bueller and harry's sally ?  unfortunately ,  it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive ,  the pace of the film is so uneven ,  and the script isn't particularly funny .there's a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy .  despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches ,  this film does not walk that line very well
the plot to this movie or so called sequal is horrible .   i rented this movie expecting something good and i end up falling asleep .   i actually had to watch it several times just to find out what really happened .   don't even buy it ,  it is a waist of your money
this has got to be the worst film i've ever seen .  its not sad .  its not funny ,  jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage .  i don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie ,  because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him .  the actor is the worst of all .  i cant tell if he's sad in some seens ,  or angry or jest retarded .  i've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks ,  i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present .  it probably worked better back in 96' .  but this movie is so so so bad .  its embarrassing .  do not rent it or buy it or view it on television .note's :  this film had  some great talenta song from olivia newton jon ,  and  ( one of my most personal favorites )  mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho .  she's to good but .  .  . why this film ,  she  ( and mila  )  are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this .
the first set was very entertaining--a spy/crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by moore and curtis--set ii is another kettle of fish altogether .   the second set is strictly played for laughs--there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin .   frankly ,  i hoped for more .for those who wish to obtain a true collector's set of this highly entertaining series ,  would do better to purchase the network dvd megaset special edition of the persuaders ,  now available thru amazonuk with some delighful extras including bumpers ,  promotional materials ,  episode commentaries ,  tv spot interviews ,  title sequences ,  and hour-long interviews with director ,  robert baker ,  tony curtis ,  and roger moore .   tony curtis' unabashed comments regarding the production team ,   guest-star joan collins's antics on the set ,  and his marijuana bust en route to london for the taping of the first episode ,  are absolutely priceless in this network dvd set .surprisingly ,  the acute observer will notice that some of the episodes in the second box of the a&e set are written by none other than terry nation--who would go on to pen a bigger and more serious series survivors in the uk four years later-when will that be available in the us ?
okay ,  the script is not the most imaginative i've ever seen ,  but i like the actors  ( especially ben's best man )  so i was friendly with this movie for the most part .   i didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot ,  such as .  .  . why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones ?  or at least ,  why don't they use them ?   oh no ,  much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to nc .   i didn't even mind the fact that the whole  " we're married and my husband's a doctor .  "  charade was so predictable .  oh gee ,  he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people .  d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and  " dr .  holmes "  might have to step up ?   and uh ,  they're pretending to be married and oh !  surprise there's the best man and maid of honor !  d'ya think they're gonna get busted ?what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending .   it was obviously supposed to be a surprise  ( and it was )  but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience .   i felt cheated .  i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben ,  and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah's little boy and all that .   i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget ,  i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other .   the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen .   right up to the last moment ,  we think he's breaking it off with bridget .  instead ,  what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all .huh ?   he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane !  !  !  after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back .   this man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life ,  and i'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after ?not only that ,  but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously ?   it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us  " don't do it !  "  and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage ,  aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway .   it's just marriage .  it's romantic !  you could get lucky and live happily ever after !it's been my experience ,  when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding ,  turn and run .  the last thing you should do is close your eyes ,  grab your balls and take the leap
others have already described the movie ;  so i shall not repeat what has already said .dumont makes a movie ,  somewhat reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s  " road "  movies ,  in which a couple ,  gets in a car and drives off ,  to nowhere in particular .  i hated those movies ,  but at least ,  in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it .  here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality ,  have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen ,  and seem only to be there to move the plot ,  if there is one ,  along .katia ,  the girl ,  who seems quite psycotic if you ask me ,  keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever ;  for instance ,  she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car ,  then gets p#$sed at her boyfriend ,  when he hits one of them .  by the time the movie approaches its dismal end ,  i did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up .the dvd includes a  " director's note of intent "   ( always a bad sign )  a mix of felliniesque dialog ,  blended with sun tzu ;  not a good combination .  at the end of the  " note of intent "  the director finishes with  " envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct "well ,  instinct will not get you a viewable movie ;  i don't think you could make a worse movie ,  if you were trying to achieve it .  it is not the violence or sex ,  other movies have that but still have some redeeming values ,  photography ,  artistic creation .  there is no redeeming value in this .  just a waste of the dvd plastic .
thirteen ghosts is about a machine .  this machine was designed by a man who was at the time possessed my satan .  yes ,  satan .  if the plot doesn't seem stupid enough ,  it needs ghosts to power it .  ghostbusters anyone ?  at the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a michael j fox movie .   as time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts .  if done right ,  it opens the 'eye to hell' .save yourself a few bucks and don't rent this .   it's awfu
i really hate how all these exercise videos are repackaged and called something different .   it's damn confusing .at any rate ,  just be aware that if you buy  " sleek physique "    ( also called  " slim physique "  in different packaging !  )  from karen voight you are getting to same stuff  from this dvd .shame
the show is not so funny it repeats itself and it has too much music ,  dancing and intros for my favour .  watch instead mad t . v .  or the chapelle show
i was given the  " special fan remix "  edition of this film last christmas ,  and i must say ,  the so-called bonus features only detract from the wonderful original .   so stick with the original
i'm not going to write too much .  if you need to hear more just check other reviews down here .from all the 3 episodes only the first one ,  by kar-wai ,  is worth your time ." the hand "  is well done and typical kar-wai .  beautifully shot by his usual contributor christopher doyle ,  it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch .  gong li ,  always very elegant ,  give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story .  well crafted but very predictable .  the director lately seems to be referencing himself ,  which is halfway form self parody ." equilibrium "  is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy .  other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots ,  is a simple and boring exchange between downey jr .  playing an adman and his analyst played by arkin .but the worst by far is the antonioni's episode .  is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment .  the ,  once ,  great director should have just retired by now  ( he was 91 in 2004 )  and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces
not a good copy of this great movie .  i'd wait and buy the &quot ; restored authorized edition . &quot ;  even though i bought this version ,  i've ordered the other .  that's how much i like metropolis is general
here we have what has to be one of the most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made !  i couldn't believe what i was watching !  moreover , i am aghast that this film garnered some acclaim and that some reviewers on these pages even saw fit to award this dreck with an unbelievable four and five star rating .  what is going on ?  is it me or them that has totally lost the plot of what movies are supposed to be all about ?  am i naive to think that movies should first and foremost entertain ?  where oh where was the entertainment in this lame effort of a film with its unsteady shaky comera work , hamfisted confusing screenplay lacking energy and inventiveness and the cloying performance of modern cinema's most tedious and overratedsleep inducing actor ralph fiennes ?how i long for the good old days when we had great movies with great actors from great writers and great directors and which achieved what they set out to do - entertain . sadly with the emergence of such a travesty as  " the constant gardener "  it appears that we unfortunate  " real "  film lovers are in for a dismal viewing future .
i have to agree with most of the other reviews .  this movie not great art but to me it is great comedy and strangely compelling .  i have found myself watching it over and over again .  i would rate the film as five-stars .  unfortunately ,  i can not buy the dvd because the cheapskates at warner have only released this in butchered full-screen format .  as such ,  i can only rate this dvd as two-stars and certainly no stars for warner
the novel of wide sargasso sea was  decent book .  a re-writing of jane eyre's bertha .  but the film is really hard to tolerate .  it starts out ok .  although it seems to start deviating from the book early on .  past the point where antoinette marries rochester the film turns in to nothing but soft porn and the acting gets worse too .
i was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my dvd player and sat down to watch .   it didn't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film .   the story was interesting and had it been done in a better way ,  the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as trick and latter days where the acting and production quality were very good ,  i found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments .   it is not a movie i would readily recommend
simply put :  the movie is boring .   clich� upon clich� is confirmed and story lines never come together .  it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary .  the main plot is very thin  ( a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince ,  gets caught and then warns the prince  ( why ?  )  )  and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting .  so ,  a kid dies ,  which results in the  " natural "  response of the father :  freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death .  the lawyer has a drunk  " friend "  and keeps him around ,  why ,  no one knows .  some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship .all in all ,  this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while .  i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged .  i neither laughed nor cried ,  i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause .  it meant nothing to me ,  which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie .save your money ,  save your time ,  choose another movie .
many of these shorts on this dvd  ( as well as the other dvd's in this series )  have been on the treasures allready so i recomend passing on these dvd's besides all the dirt and the bad restoration you'll see on the cartoons
director :   turi meyercast :   tony todd ,  donna d'errico ,  alexia robinson ,  jsu garcia ,  mark adair-rios ,  lupe ontiveros ,  elizabeth guber ,  rena riffel ,  ernie hudson jr .running time :   93 minutesrated r for bloody violence and gore ,  sexuality and language .the third in the series derived from a concept by clive barker ,   " day of the dead "   ( they can't even come up with their own subtitle )  staggers down the well-trodden path already navigated by the  " halloween "  and  " nightmare on elm street "  movies :  that is ,  taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet .  the original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore ,  while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine .  this one is just a load of rubbish .   donna d'errico ,  from baywatch  ( what a spectacle of credibility )  ,  stars as caroline mckeever ,  the great great granddaughter of the feared candyman  ( tony todd once again )  ,  once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror .   caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest .  as the candyman hacks his way through various bad actors ,  caroline teams up with new pal david  ( nick corri )  to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the candyman while he was still alive ,  which may hold the key to stopping him .there's not a single thing here that isn't scavenged from the first  " candyman "  film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days .  the screenplay is so lazy it can't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot ,  the photography is bright and glossy ,  which is at odds with what's supposed to be a dark story ,  while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all .  anyone could have directed this movie ,  so little effort has been put in to make it scary ,  while the ending is an outrageous cop out .  no thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having d'errico running around in a variety of tight vests .   the rest of the performances are poor too ,  although none are quite as bad as d'errico's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically .   surely more can be done with characters like the candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone's stomach .   the fact that the makers of this movie think candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can't be bothered even to try something a bit different .   clive barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be ,  but he's right about one thing :  the sequels to his movies are garbage
i never saw this movie until i was 16 .  the girl i was dating at the time loved this movie .  the rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way .  but they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies .  i did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments ,  well so did fraggle rock !  fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason !  everyone burn your copies now
five gen-x yuppies  ( yup ,  they're old enough to be that now )  reunite for the funeral of one of their friends .  what ensues is a parody of the big chill ,  complete with bad 80s music .  then mysterious bugs that disintegrate in bright light start infesting them one by one ,  turning them into murderous zombies .  so far ,  so eccentric ,  and the satire is sometimes very funny .  the fx are so bargain-basement ,  however ,  and the plotting so loose ,  that the film loses direction and winds uup just going through the motions in the last half-hour after a rather promising set-up .  zach galligan must have been really hungry for work when he chose to do this movie .the menu is basic ,  and the only extras are trailers for infested ,  anaconda ,  and the creature features series .i like the wit .  now if only a bit more attention had been paid to the horror plot ,  and we might have something here
honestly ,  nothing about this show grabs me .  i'm surprised this show gets such high nielsen ratings every week .  the writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time .  but the biggest flaw is the acting .  it is really laughable .  me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be .  horatio caine talks in a slow drawl all the time ,  saying the stupidest and most obvious things .  calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating .  none of the c . s . i team displays any emotion whatsoever ,  oh .  .  . except horatio when he over does it .the stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable .  if there's a v . i . p suspect with a  " history "  with horatio ,  yup .  .  . you guessed it ,  he's involved  ( either directly or indirectly )  .  and also ,  if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show .  .  . yea ,  it's not him .  and calleigh gets  " evidence "  such as dna from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality .  i mean ,  once or twice is alright .  .  . but i've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time .  every criminal here is an idiot ,  they are sure to leave all kinds of huge  " clues "  leading to them or their alliances .  and every crime gets solved all the time .  oh ,  and is it just me or does the c . s . i team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips ,  no need for books or researching ,  they already have it that big brain of theirs .  think that's unlikely ?  exactly my point .in short ,  i wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show .  in fact ,  even if someone gives me this dvd set as a gift ,  i would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else .  watch this show if you're really bored ,  with nothing else to do and no better use of your time .  if you want real crime scene investigation ,  watch the original c . s . i ,  las vegas .  that's the best c . s . i .  .  .  . period
every store should have a dvd shredder for movies that suck .  rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away .  adding darryl hannah and denise richards to an already horrible story line just to sell dvds is a disgrace .  trying to do 80's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more .  maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one .  save your time ,  money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video .
michael moriarity is my hero !  he is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion .  he has done such great b-movies as this ,  q ,  and it's alive 3 :  island of the alive .  how awesome is he ?  ?  anyways ,  i think that this movie was hilarious !  i think a lot of people take this movie too seriously ,  thinking that it is going to be your typical movie .  but you shouldn't because not only is this a b-movie ,  but it is supposed to be funny .  my favorite part is when  " the stuff "  started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it .  who would do that ?  ?  i just started laughing by butt off when that happened .  so if you watch this movie ,  just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth ,  don't be too critical on it .what i learned from the stuff :  dairy products are evil !  especially if they come from with in the earth !if you like the stuff ,  i recommend :  watching other b-movies ,  such as island of the alive 3 ,  zombi 3 and 4 ,  etc
wow - hard to put into words how bad this was .  .  .  .  .  .  we kept waiting for the funny - it never came - we didn't even watch the end .  .  .  .  when they started turning julia roberts  ( tess )  into the  " real "  julia roberts - well - we were done .  .  .  .  .  .  .  note funny - no .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
filming the story of gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio ,  from warner brothers to bbc .  the virgin queen still retains her power to enthrall ,  intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne .  she was perhaps england's last true absolute monarch ,  and certainly one of its greatest ,  if not most famous .since the advent of film ,  she has been one of the most coveted roles to play .  indeed ,  few monarchs have been so closely chronicled ,  save perhaps her own father ,  henry viii ,  and victoria .she has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses :  sarah bernhardt ,  bette davis ,  judi dench ,  judith anderson ,  miranda richardson ,  flora robson ,  cate blanchett ,  helen mirren ,  even quentin crisp ,  and most famously ,  and importantly ,  glenda jackson .and it must be said without doubt that glenda jackson's  " elizabeth r "  is the defining portrait-- the most accomplished ,  historically accurate ,  and masterfully acted .  glenda jackson is elizabeth i reincarnate ;  there is simply none better ,  and likely never will be .so now we have anne-marie duff in the red wig for 230 masterpiece theatre minutes .  perhaps for the sake of revisionists ,  we are offered a far less imperious monarch ,  one who is both reactive  ( the real one was )  and passive  ( the real one was not )  .  duff is an odd choice .  no beauty like cate blanchett ,  but elizabeth was known for vanity ,  not beauty .  duff's elizabeth ,  with quivering lip and watercolor behavior ,  seems filmed underwater ,  and make for an undesirable monarch-- certainly not the gloriana of myth or fact .  where is her famous wit ,  her coy manipulations ,  her strong moral fiber ,  her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers ?  left with glenda jackson ,  i suppose .  this elizabeth is a simpering ,  love-struck maiden or a crass ,  60-something hag  ( and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance )  .  hag works ;  crass manages ;  simpering loses the whole impact .a suavely elegant ,  very attractive and distinctly healthy queen mary i opens elizabeth's story  ( no catharine parr ,  no thomas seymour ,  no childhood )  but is quickly dispatched .  just as well ,  for she's thoroughly ill-cast--mary was none of those things .   ( far better was the wonderful kathy burke in the blanchett version ,  though she was a bit of a protestant caricature )  .  daphne slater in the jackson series was far more appealing ,  and perfectly written .elizabeth's transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life .  no part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years-- the abuse by seymour ,  imprisonment ,  exile ,  and finally her accession .  unfortunately ,  much of this key period is sped through .  the fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast elizabeth mooning incessantly over robert dudley ,  later earl of leicester ,  here played by a childish ,  petulant tom hardy .  there is no chemistry here ;  he is pretty ,  but vacant .  glenda jackson's dudley ,  robert hardy  ( no relation that i know of )  ,  is a bit of a fop ,  but he knows his place in court and elizabeth's heart .  their chemistry is clear .  this version of dudley is a bit ridiculous-- how he would claim the queen's heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance .  so is most of the casting  ( what's with the acrobat ?  )an egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by dudley's long-suffering wife amy robsart ,  whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery .  more time should have been spent on the wooing of elizabeth by the french duc d'alencon ,  who very nearly came to be her husband  ( again ,  the 1971 glenda jackson version handles this segment masterfully )  .all too soon and without sufficient explanation ,  we become immersed in the historically key ,  decades-long battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous mary ,  queen of scots-- elizabeth's 2nd cousin ,  granddaughter of henry viii's older sister margaret ,  whose claim to the english throne made her a rallying point of catholics ,  and a very real threat to elizabeth  ( it was mary's son james who succeeded elizabeth in 1603 ,  founding the ill-fated house of stuart )  .far more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of mary ,  queen of scots ,  which was elizabeth's darkest hour-- forever bloodying her saintly propaganda .  likewise ,  more attention should have been given to walshingham ,  elizabeth's master of subversion ,  although william cecil ,  lord burghley ,  is given fair due .the decisive armada happens much too quickly ,  lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of elizabeth and robert devereaux ,  earl of essex ,  portrayed by hans matheson ,  who is cast and directed as a bad-tempered ,  bipolar  " mama's boy "   ( a very strange oedipal twist here )  whose hair ,  look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585 .  the entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship ,  here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling .  the casting is awful ,  the acting mediocre ,  the personality baffling .  this essex is a wreck-- blame the revisionist director .two significant annoyances :  elizabeth's  ( duff's )  accent isn't simply london middle-class ,  which would be fine ,  but stands in stark contrast to everyone else's appropriate english diction and clarity .  she comes off as a guttersnipe .  and worse of all-- distracting to the utmost-- is the incessant soundtrack that dominates--and not pleasantly-- the action and plot of the movie .  the sheer volume of it is horrendous ,  to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with essex's electric guitar .my suggestion here is to rent this one ,  watch it as long as you can ,  and then return to davis ,  blanchett ,  jackson ,  or even dench .  overall ,  a disappointment .  were it not for 95% historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes-- plus the decent acting  ( most of the problems are the director's fault ,  don't blame the actors )  ,  it would have earned one star .  but this queen is no legend ,  and this cast is horrendous .  an inglorious gloriana .
this dvd covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds !   it does not give enough body to the addition explanation and is hard to follow .   it was a pure waste of money
read the amazon editorial review ,  they are tiptoeing around saying this movie doesn't really work .modern language ,  ideas ,  and sensibilities make the whole thing feel like a contrived stage play .   and it seems to be mostly on stage sets  .  .  .  there isn't much of venice in here ,  so don't rent it for that reason .    ( notice i said rent  .  .  .  )the script is weak .   the setup for the lead character's transition to life as a courtesan is abbreviated and unconvincing .   there are too many horrible moments for this to be romantic .   the story has so much more potential .the only reason to see this movie is to check out catherine mccormack .   rufus sewell is always good as well .otherwise the casting is absurd .   fred ward and oliver platt stand out as being miscast .   jacqueline bisset fails to persuade here
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  the characters are unlikeable except for charity's two friends .  the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull .  i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar .  the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr .  was in it .  he's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid .  this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie .  i have no desire to see her other movies then
this is a made for tv movie and not the original film .  do not waste your money on this re-make .  buy the original that was released in 1967 and starred robert blake
this show is my all time favorite ,  however universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser ,  and a wrong season premier intro !dvd is meant to bring out the best in media ,  not the worst ,  how could they lose sound effects ?  unbelievable !  just doesn't seem possible .  .  .  season 4 is no better .  .  .universal please read this and re-release season 3 and 4 already ,  the fans are extremely pissed off !
our family has an embarassingly large collection of elmo and sesame street dvds ,  so i speak from experience .  .  .  i found this production to be way below par .  my 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe  : 10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do play-doh instead .  the plot if poorly contrived ,  the production value is low ,  the acting for the most part is awful ,  and it's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age ,  my son has no interest in .  he did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer .  but i'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip .  better bets :  a celebration of me ,  grover or sesame street :  the street we live on
i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot .  it was terrible .  first because of the camera shake ,  i don't know about you but i can't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking .  needless to say i didn't make it through the whole film ,  but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch
teenagers plan a mock crime for kicks on the same day criminals knock off a bank for real and their paths cross .   i can understand implying that two ex-cons have or had a homosexual relationship but to lace an entire movie  with cheap double-entendre and to stoop so low as to give a lead male  character a female first name is a trifle ridiculous  ( ok ,  director we 'get  it' all men are secretly gay !  you made your point ,  move on !  )  i can't even  imagine that a person of same gender orientation could possibly find this  film the least bit interesting much less stimulating .   ( for an intelligent  crime caper with a same-sex subplot see &quot ; bound&quot ;  )   since this  movie is supposed to take place in wisconsin they give the locals a  southern accent .   an absolute bore
i received this dvd from my brother who is possibly a bigger kevin smith fan than i am .  i thought the fact that he was  giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until i watched the dvd myself .the degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and jay and silent bob's toned-down appearances don't help much .  i really liked the original degrassi series so i was disappointed by this dvd .there are some funny moments in the  " extras "  section of the dvd but i would still only recommend this as a  " rent "  or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan .
whatever else the gltb community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk ,  the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy ,  and that is a boldfaced lie .   featuring world famous funny man dom deluise ,  the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians .  .  . and  " sparks fly .  "   as it is ,  the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe .from the movie's self-proclaimed description ,  and with deluise in a major role ,  the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless :   does deluise know that the actresses are lesbians ?   do the production's other members ?  does that derail the production ?   what mayhem ensues ?in point of fact ,  however ,  the single attempt at  " comedy "  comes from deluise's portrayal of the director as a prissy ,  fastidious old queen ,  pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats .the bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue ,  as the  " actresses "  explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers .   unfortunately ,  there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore .   the few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under deluise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic .   there is an inescapable feeling that the camera ,  the viewer ,  and deluise ,  are intruders .about the only thing that can be said about this film is that director lee friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles ,  thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort ;  the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street .   other reviewers have commented on the bad ,  infomercial level acting of the two lead characters .   whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads ,  robin greenspan and lacie harmon ,  are actually lesbians simply playing themselves .   if so ,  then this is bad acting .   if the women are straight ,  however ,  one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances .   sadly ,  there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film .
highly acclaimed .  that ,  i knew .  i watched the first 30 minutes ,  which is 1/4 of the movie ,  before i decided to hang it up .  new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop .  this upsets the local church ,  even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate .  okay .  can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot ?  nope .  this one's boring .
this movie does not make sense .  and it's not weird in the style of david lynch ,  it's just complete crap .  i thought willie wonka and the chocolate factory was the worst/stupidest fil ever until i saw this .  do not buy this .  it is not a family movie ,  and it is not funny or entertaining
starring tony perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer .  what can you say ?  the red sox have jimmy pirsall ,  tony perkins and  " fear strikes out "  .  the yankees have lou gehrig ,  gary cooper and  " pride of the yankees "  .
the badi can't say i dislike this item ,  but i did not like it either .  even though i'm still a novice golfer  ( score between 95-105 )  and been playing for about 18 months ,  i've read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other dvds  .  .  .  ( yes i'm an instruction junky )  and i can say that this instrutor  ( simon holmes )  misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing ,  and even though i like how the dvd has a well structured lesson category listing ,  he does not explain deeply enough on many things .the filming production seems to have a good intention for this dvd ,  but it lacks camera closeups/slowmotions on the ball ,  clubhead ,  ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want's to explain .  i mean with today's technology on dvd production ,  this seems to be a cheap one .the goodhe has very good tips on many subjects that i think they're transparent for a very beginner .if this is not your first instructional dvd ,  and just want to gather a new bunch of tips ,  then buy it .  otherwise a better selection that i can reccomend for a complete golf school dvd ,  is the wally armstrong's ultimate golfing experience .  the set is very cheap because it's a compilation of old '80s and 90'videos from that instructor ,  and from the 5 dvd's in the box ,  you can thrash 2 if you like ,  but for $17 bucks .  .  . hey !  !  is worth it !i hope this helps and saves you some money
it is obvious the makers of this film were trying to create some kind of action-comedy hybrid ,  however it just doesn't work .  the action scenes seem tacked-on and the gags just don't work .
i saw this movie yesterday thinking it'd be exciting .  i sure am glad that i survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie .  there's no story line ,  the acting is pathetic ,  whoever gave vin diesel the idea that he can act .  like an earlier reviewer observes it's about who's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review
i saw this movie for the first time ,  and i found out that it is very very violent .  and i laughed at some good parts ,  but the scene where amy hits the wildlife keeper on the head with a frying pan for trying to cut the baby geese's wing is not what you want your kids to see .i think that this movie should be taken off the market ,  but this type of film has no place in the lives of young children .
these are old disney shows from 2 series .   i saw then on the late-night  " vault disney "  series .   they were well done and interesting .   the only problem is that this dvd is only a few  ( 6 total )  of the 18 shows .   so although i would rate the shows as a 4 or 5 ,  this release gets 1 star for being incomplete .save your money for if and when the whole series comes out
i am sorry to report that this movie is dead on arrival ,  and i have to agree with anybody that says this movie is  [  .  .  .  ]  .  the whole cast is wasted in this movie ,  and most of which i have seen in movies that i liked better .  like pretty much the leads in this movies ,  i have seen thier movies and liked htem better in ,  but this one ,  they might as well .  if your a tim allen fan ,  please do yourself a favor ,  and get either the santa clause movies ,  or the toy story movies ,  and avoid this movie at all costs .  here are 99 minuts of my life ,  that i won't see again ,  and i am trying to make sure that you don't waste your time on this dud .  who wants to see an actor pretned to be a dog ,  in some scenes in the movie ,  ore pretty much the whole thing .  i haven't seen monster house or cars ,  but i hope that these will be 2 better movies ,  or maybe a season dvd of home improvement will be pretty then this .  dave douglas  ( tim allen )  is a lawyer ,  that dislikes dogs ,  and even has a case against animal activist justin forrester  ( joshua leonard )  .  and he is up for accused of trying to torch the california headquarters of sinister pharmaceutical conglomerate grant & strictland .  and he doesn't much of a family life ,  since he is never home ,  and how many times have we seen something like this in a movie ?  his wife is rebecca douglas  ( kristin davis )  and they have 2 children josh  ( spencer breslin )  and carly  ( zena grey )  .  and he has an appoontment to josh's pta meetings ,  and even through he is reminded at work ,  he forgets .  carly is not only a is both forrester's student and a budding animal advocate herself ,  and her brother is trying out for football like his dad ,  even through he secretly hates it ,  and didn't sign up for the fall musical .  and then there is a mad scientist  ( robert downey jr .  )  ,  trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a tibetan monastery .  and carly even kidnaps it from grant & strictland ,  and brings him home ,  nad even trouble starts when the dog bites douglas ,  that gets him starting acting like a dog too ,  and even looking exactly like him at times .  the movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old ,  which would be impossible ,  since neither dogs or people live that long ,  all i can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes ,  and this is one to avoid at all costs .
into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites .   having seen the pbs presentation of this ,  i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited .   rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction ,  this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups .   this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play ;  the staging .   by forcing the viewer's perspective ,  this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath .i am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision
i saw this at the library and brought it home ,  thinking it might be interesting to watch .  i very rarely watch films made after the 1950's ,  but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable .  it ended up being only mildly enjoyable ,  and a bit boring .  i felt that within all the time it ran ,  we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters ;  seemed to remain in shallow waters all along .  the film was sort of good .  .  . pretty photography , and for the most part it seemed like the costumes ,  hair ,  way of speaking ,  etc .  were accurate for the time period  ( so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when )  but something just wasn't quite right ,  and it is hard to know exactly what it was .  i was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate .  i think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity .  i am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed .  so i would not recommend this film for families with young  children ,  because of the nudity .
the biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions .   witch hunter robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime .   i didn't like it ;  i found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so-that's-it ? ' ending i hated .the animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky .   good visuals don't make up for bad story though .   this serious drama geared is towards adults ,  and not children .   if you like dramatic build-up that delivers ,  humor ,  or romantic comedy give this a pass
" the ring two "  is a horror film that gets so bogged down in the minutiae of its storytelling that it simply forgets to be scary .   naomi watts and david dreckman return as the mother and son who have recently fled to a remote section of oregon in an attempt to escape the murderous clutches of samara ,  the ghost of a young girl whom they encountered in the previous film .   however ,  like any specter worth her salt ,  samara has managed to track the pair down and quickly begins her scheme of possessing the boy as a way of returning to the land of the living .this is an extraordinarily under-whelming thriller that is little more than a series of extremely mild shocks  ( if you even want to call them that )  interrupted by long stretches of hopelessly dull exposition .   the story itself makes very little sense ,  and the climax is so blas� and half-hearted that i couldn't be sure the movie had actually ended until the credits started rolling by .    " the ring two "  has a few impressive special effects up its sleeve ,  but not nearly enough to relieve the tedium that afflicts so much of the movie .in a mere two installments ,  this series seems already to have run its course .   if this  " ring "  comes a-callin` ,  don`t answer
i love adam sandler .   well ,  i used to love him ,  before he made eight crazy nights .   not only was this cartoon not funny ,  it was downright trash .   i would not recommend this  " feature "  to anyone .    " eight crazy nights "  was short on story ,  long on time ,  and wearing on patience .   i kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself ;  i needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that i will never get back .   needless to say ,  i stuck it out until the credits ,  and now i have to live with the facts that i :  1 .  )  watched the movie ;  and 2 .  )  i'll never get that time back .   so now i sit here ,  typing away a review i doubt anyone will read ,  wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie !   humbug !   watch  " ishtar ,  "  you'll get more out of it .   oh ,  and i only awarded one star because amazon insists you give everything at least one star .   i did this under protest .
when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director . to bad this one isn't a very good story .this mess came out at the heigth of the  " slasher "  movie frenzy .  but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also .  the theme of 4 kids who , now hold on here , think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival .  before you can say  " please kill me "  the  " thing "  is picking them off one by one .  with only 4 teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen ,  but no ,  they just go for the tease scares and even at 90 mins .  this bore last to long
there's a saying :   " no one sets out to make a bad movie .  "   brothers grimm  ( miramax )  might prove otherwise .   near the beginning of his commentary ,  the usually brilliant terry gilliam actually says ,   " i didn't like the script ,  but i was out of work .  "   not a good sign but an honest admission from the former python .although wonderfully visualized ,  the czech locations can't make-up for the muddled mess of a screenplay culled from perhaps the richest mother lode of raw story material available anywhere :  the collected fairy tales of wilhem and jacob grimm .in spite of stars heath ledger and matt damon as con artist exorcists who encounter real evil ,  a great poster and an ok trailer ,  audiences rightfully stayed away via quick word of mouth  (  " incomprehensible "   " unwatchable "  )  .  worthy extras of interest mainly to budding filmmakers are gilliam's commentary and the featurette :   " the visual magic of the brothers grimm .
why is this movie a classic ?  the plot line was nonexistent ,  and the characters were completely unlikeable . the implication that annie hall was a lesbian didn't make any sense !  woody allen's character was completely freeky and there was not a single purpose for him being there .  come to think of it ,  there was no purpose for this movie !  !  !  !  !  !  so save yourself and never watch this film
the film has its amusing and even touching points ,  but not very many .  the big problem with rh is that neither ford or benning are sympathetic characters .  henry is just the kind of self-important ,  ego-bloated ,  smug ,  arrogant ,  cold-blooded corporate ass that's helped step on working people for real ,  so it's really hard to feel anything for him ,  shot or not .  he's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him ,  and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is ,  if you think about it ,  appalling .  and his wife is ,  in a way ,  even worse ;  she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides .  she goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up ,  and doesn't become  " normal "  ntil much later .  only their daughter has any heart at all .  maybe a better ending would've been henry's not making it ,  bening going nuts from losing her stuff ,  and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should've been from day one .  barely watchable .
if you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews ,  you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good  ( not great )  acting .   jessica lange basically does an impression of marilyn monroe with a southern accent .   well not all of the time ,  since her accent seems to come and go .   the amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has .   skip it unless you really ,  really ,  really love jessica lange .by the way ,  if this movie is set in the early sixties ,  why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall ?   this is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend !  puh-lease
what were they thinking ?  !   there are actually scenes deleted from the original theatrical release !  !   the extended edition is an  " abomination "  if there ever were one .furthermore ,  i discourage anyone who has not seen the original from purchasing this product .   seek out the original release because i believe the  " original "  release included in this set is not of the same quality .david lynch was right in not becoming involved in this edition
i preface all of my dvd reviews with the following note :  there are more than enough film reviews on amazon . com and ,  quite frankly ,  it's a bit ridiculous .  a person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the dvd .  if you want to review or discuss a film ,  go to imdb .  if you're reviewing the dvd ,  speak to the qualities  ( or lack thereof )  of the audio and video ;  mention your opinions of the plot ,  acting ,  etc .  but please don't write an essay !now ,  on to my review of the ghost and the darkness on dvd .i remember wanting to see this movie when i was younger  ( when it was first released )  ,  but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that i bought the dvd in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history .  in terms of hollywood ,  it's fairly accurate .  the film itself ,  as entertainment ,  is great  ( it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary ?  ?  ?  )  .  i'm a fan of both douglas and kilmer ;  they're fine here ,  but they've definitely done better work elsewhere .  the plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense .  additionally ,  the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great ,  too .now the bad news :  the dvd sucks .  period .  and i'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here .  the transfer is absolutely criminal ,  and those responsible for it should never work on another dvd project ever again .  the print is clear and solid ,  but the aspect ratio is not correct at all .  i was mortified when i popped it into my player ,  only to be rewarded with a distorted image .  absolutely shameful .  .  . this film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio .video :  c-audio :  afilm :   b
during a missing persons investigation ,  a cop  [ samuel l .  jackson ]  gets kidnapped by a gang of thieves .  meanwhile ,  an elaborate bank robbery is about to go down .  of course ,  samuel does great as always ,  but the script and especially the very slow pace brings it down .  what sounded like a good movie turned out to be a dissapointment .  far from being the worst movie you can rent ,  but ,  it's just not as good as it sounds .  maybe next time ,  they won't take all day to get started
so i thought i only saw pieces of the abc presentation of desperation .  on tv i thought i missed the chapter about the first family ,  david's family ,  and how they came to be in the town jail .  it turns out i didn't miss anything ,  that's the way it was filmed .  when i heard the film was available on dvd and  " r "  rated ,  too ,  i vowed to rent it and see the movie as it was designed to be seen .  curses ,  gore ,  adult scares and ,  perhaps a booby !  one wouldn't expect anything but the most watered down presentation on abc but the  " r "  rated version ,  oh boy !the dvd ,  rated  " r "  ,  was exactly the same presentation word for word and scene for scene with the only difference being the exclusion of commercials .  i'm going to say ,  and prove me wrong ,  that the  " r "  rating was slapped on the dvd to intice people to rent it to see the original adult version .  what a sneaky rip-off .  how can they do that ?overall ,  the movie was not great .  the ending was completely tacked on and i got a little tired of the sermonizing .  the performances were ok ,  with the exception of ron perlman's performance .  he was outstanding .i know amazon sells this dvd but they also sell the book and the book is much more satisfying .  it's hard to believe the same guy that wrote the movie also wrote the book .  i'm sure everybody made lots of money on this project but i'd like my money back
well ,  this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get ,  unfortunately :  the female teenage protagonist  ( played by witherspoon ,  whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here )  acts masculine and heroic ,  the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant .  at one ridiculous point ,  the girl runs around acting like a commando ,  a veritable one-gal army ,  blowing up the bad guys ,  while the boy hides in a cave sniveling .  later ,  when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal's backpack as they cross a desert ,  the gal snaps at him ,  bella abzug-style ,  and walks quickly ahead ,  leaving him in the dust .  clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here ,  and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men .  of course ,  in the real world ,  the result for such manly girls ,  once they become women ,  is that men do not choose them and they remain alone ,  and therefore become bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men ,  of course .  in this movie ,  the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy ,  masculine gal--but that's why they call them movies .  when are these post-modern writers ,  artists ,  and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism ,  they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not prefer masculine females .  men want someone to complement them ,  not compete with them .  men crave femininity in females ,  not feminism .  wow ,  is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment !  this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie ,  at least his character does progress a little bit :  by the end of the movie ,  instead of craven and flippant ,  he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut ,  if that is even a step upward .  but the plucky gal--she's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations .uh ,  another problem with this movie--and there are many--is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert ,  something which should be ,  and for a time is here depicted as ,  a foreboding and life-threatening task .  yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog ;  and we see the boy's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner ,  considering the dire situation they are in .  the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted ,  inane scenes .look ,  i dig disney kid movies--more realistic ones .  you know ,  old style disney movies .  you take  " old yeller "  for example .  now there was a quality kid movie ,  and quite true to life .this movie was not .  it had a plastic ,  spoiled-american-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout .  disney has gone down the tubes .  in any number of ways ,  they've been subverted by radical marxist agendas  ( note :  one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion--something called  " tapping ,  "  while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-pc judeo-christian religion--this is bias ,  folks ,  leftwing ,  pc bias ,  same as the aforementioned feminist bilge )  .  i am learning to run ,  not walk ,  away from disney stuff ,  and this movie was further cause for me to do so .
after seeing the real show in l . a .  ,  my girlfriend and i were really looking forward to the dvd .   and after last night's viewing ,  i went to bed kinda creeped out and actually felt a little guilty that i didn't like the whole thing that much .   i'm relieved to see that other fans just couldn't handle all the audience shots either .   this dvd tries so hard to define paul's place in our lives and his impact on the world through his music that it ends up blowing it for those of us who already know ,  feel ,  and live it .   they tried to document his music and its impact instead of just filming it .   if you're from mars and this is your first day on earth ,  you might appreciate the way the dvd attempts to explain the relevance of paul's work .   if you've been on this planet for awhile ,  chances are you're already up to speed and just want to see the band and hear the music
i hated this movie .  so unrealistic .  sure ,  maybe there are some little freaks running around raping and drinking and beating .  but i am a teenager in a city .  nobody acts like this !what the hell is the point of this movie ?  to scare the crap out of parents ?also ,  the rape scene was vile .  at first i respected the director for showing it and not shying away .  a full minute later ,  i started feeling awkward and uncomfortable .  it wasn't even artistic ,  it was just disgusting and truly disturbing
i was a huge fan of the books growing up ,  and a lover of the period and jannette oke's books .  i had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series .  well ,  i just finished -- and could hardly stop from yawning while i watched !the movie started out well enough .   wonderful filming ,  great costuming ,  glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time .   no ,  the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie .the scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch .   i remembered the tomboyish missie from the last film and couldn't wait to see her older .   the actress portraying the older missie just did not do her justice !  while she was pretty ,  she read most of her lines flat ,  with little emotion .   the worst was the very ending ,  which was supposed to have been a heart-breaking moment between father and daughter ,  instead fell completely flat .   in fact ,  most of the scenes with missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left .i think there were several attempts to portray missie as spirited  ( like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant )  ,  but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid missie we were continually seeing .apart from that ,  the rest of the cast was average ,  with a few star moments here and there .   i can't remember the book very well to check for accuracy ,  but the story was so-so as well -- melodrama only reared its head in a few places .only if you want to keep up-to-date with the series ,  i would recommend this .   otherwise ,  i'm glad they replaced missie's actress for the next film .   perhaps we'll get to see a more energetic performance .
how anyone could rate this movie 4-5 stars is beyond belief .  this was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere .  as i watched this movie i could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama .  it was never very funny and both lead actors ,  playing one white and one adopted black brother ,  had scenes in the movie that were terrible .  romany malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body .  he jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings ,  runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them ,  in his drawers ?  he is talentless and idiotic as a &quot ; brother&quot ;  in france that no one can relate to .  paul rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and &quot ; grossly&quot ;  tells off everyone - people he has known for less than a week !  the servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well .  .  . but can't make up for the dismal rest .  ludicrous - a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama .  this is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints
while some critics can argue with dan brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points ,  one thing these da vinci  " debunking "  presentations will never be able to refute is this :  the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity ,  primarily by the catholic church ,  and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago :  1969 .  nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review .  this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light ,  when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals .  dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago ,  with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still ,  quite frankly ,  shocking and debasing .  sorry ,  but upon this  " rock "  of male dominancy was built the church .thank you again ,  dan brown ,  by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations ,  obscurations and lies .  these obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty ,  insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses ,  and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources ,  worth trillions ,  through guilt ,  control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power .  and those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty dan browns put together .  people are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive men's club with jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship ?  to answer these questions ,  some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth ,  because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page ,  especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption .  the next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the vatican thrown open for public view .  lord only knows what plunder they contain
there's a reason why they talk about the  " voice of an angel "  -- it's because charlotte church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one .  her acting debut  " i'll be there "  is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres ,  where it rapidly dropped out of sight .  rightly so .seventeen years ago ,  paul kerr  ( craig ferguson )  of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert .  fast forward to the present :  kerr discovers that unknown to him ,  his ex rebecca  ( jemma redgrave )  gave birth to a daughter ,  olivia  ( charlotte church )  ,  who is now a well-adjusted paper girl .the problem is ,  olivia has been kept a secret from her dad .  rebecca is embittered ,  but kerr wants to get to know his daughter ,  and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father .  music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together ,  but rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps ." i'll be there "  was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler ,  who ,  despite being only in her twenties ,  has had an immensely interesting life .  well ,  maybe someday she will get a biopic ,  because  " i'll be there "  is only similar in one way :  it involves a rock star and his daughter .  otherwise ,  it is boring in about every way that tyler's life is interesting .with a forgettable script ,  not much humor and a goofy premise ,  the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy ,  scripted for church to act out .  and not a terribly interesting teenager ,  either .  it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest ;  it's an obvious ploy to show off church's vocal skills .the best that can be said of church's performance is that at times she looks sweet .  as for acting talent ,  she is bland at best ,  but she does perform some good songs ,  and her voice is as pretty as ever .  just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes .  redgrave does as good a job as she can ,  and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker .  his is the only memorable role in the film ,  and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull miss church .miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the britney spears approach .   " i'll be there ,  "  but i promise i'll get out as soon as i can
this newborn care dvd is strictly for caring for a newborn infant ,  in other words ,  what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks .   my biggest beef with this dvd is that it totally just skims over all the basics ,  such as how to breastfeed properly ,  how to bottlefeed properly ,  how to swaddle properly ,  how to calm a baby properly ,  etc .   all the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn ,  each is given about 5 seconds of screen time .   instead ,  the bulk of the program is wasted on things like  " pre-birth preparation ,  "  which interestingly appears toward the end of the program ,  and how the mother should take care of herself .   these are important things to know ,  but not for a  " ultimate baby care dvd .  "the dvd packaging is also very misleading .   it says  " over an hour of hints "  .  .  .  but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of  " you should always consult your doctor "  warning ,  plus a long end-of-program credit .   the actual content is about 55 minutes .i've seen this dvd and the  " abc of newborn baby care "  dvd and even though the latter is not great ,  it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step ,  and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly .   between the two dvds ,  i definitely recommend the latter .btw ,  you can likely find this at your local library .   it's also available from netflix .   it's just not worth the price of the dvd ,  not even 1/10 of the price
mccully 1adam mccullyinstructor lee hobbsengl 101 . 02518 november 2005red dragonwhen i heard that universal studios was making a prequel to silence of the lambs ,  i'll admit that i was a little skeptical .   throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which ,  more or less ,  is what this prequel was .   caddyshack ii ,  godfather iii ,  and bill and ted's bogus journey ,  all horrible follow ups to great films .   so naturally i was a little worried that the film red dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film .   any movie that follows a great film like silence of the lambs has a lot to live up to .   personally ,  i thought that the first sequel to silence of the lambs ,   hannibal ,  didn't quite achieve that ,  and neither did red dragon .   it was a decent movie ,  but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first .   don't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value ,  but since it didn't come first i had already come to expect that .   i thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films ,  but clearly their work shows otherwise .all in all ,  this movie disappointed me for several reasons .   as i mentioned before ,  the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that i ,  as a fan of the films ,  had come to expect .   but mostly ,  it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors .   i've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception .
the basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine' integrate back into society .   yes ,  it's been done before but still holds promise .   the plot was adequate .the acting was believable - no complaints there .   i particularly enjoyed sean pertwee as 'mace' .   and jason isaacs has long been a favorite actor .but what ruined the movie for me was the science .   i'm not a fanatic - i have no problems with ftl travel or spaceships 'banking' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies .   and i realize that movies are not 'real' .   but i've never seen more 'bad' science in any one movie .   my son and i watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers .i could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night .   it spoiled the whole movie for me
colin firth and kevin bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman .  bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man ,  with firth as the anchor of the team .  off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives .  but i found  " truth "  confusing and unengaging .  i found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo .  and as several have noted ,  lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible .  give this one a pass
to violent for anyone !  this movie is horrible .  the cast is good ,  but the plot stinks !  its just this family who have super powers .  then this kid wanted to be mr .  incredibles side kick .   ( in a way ) mr .  incredible says no so then he hates him .  then the kid turns evil and kills people ,  and wants every body to like him .  thats origanal .  there are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes ,  and there is way to much violence .  killing ,  guns ,  punching ,  bombs ,  and they say stupid words sometimes .  i do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence .  so i do not recommend this movie to anyone .  especially the 2 disc special edition !
i saw this on tv the other night and had to switch channels halfway .  worst film ever ,  i dont care if this did'nt help you ,  this film p ! ssed me off so much that i had to write a hateful review .  how is it meant to be entertainin
michael moore can be really funny at times ,  but most people should not take this goofball too seriously .   about half way through 'the big one' ,  i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i didn't know where moore was going .   what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick ?   this is not one of his better films
added- 5 whole minutes- documentary about how to make a great movie suck by     making it a broadway production .deleted- karaoke version of five songs from the soundtrack :  hold me now ,  do you really want to hurt me ,  every little thing she does is magic ,  rappers delight ,  white weddingworth the extra $13 - i think noti suppose if you are one of the four people on the planet that doesn't own this classic there is a option of which edition to purchase ,  for the rest of us ,  it's just not worth it .
an average customer review of almost 4 stars ?   have you people all gone mad or worse still have amnesia ?   jason supposedly went to hell yeah ?   then why is still in one piece .   this time round ,  the government realise there's nothing they can do to stop jason and have him captured .   he is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm .   unfortunatley ,  he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space !  yes space !   the budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good .   there may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it's just not enough !  this sequel sounds more like a star trek episode and completely ignores or escapes the true origins of a good friday the 13th flick .   supposedly ,  a twelfth friday the 13th movie is being made  ( if you count the excellent freddy vs jason )  .   while freddy vs jason was indeed impressive ,  there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore
betty hutton has a colossal amount of energy .  she seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining .  she's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers .  her voice is sturdy ,  durable ,  indestructible .but oh my god ,  her acting choices  .  .  .  she and the indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film  ( whereas buffalo bill ,  allegedly a larger-than-life character ,  looks like a corpse by comparison ,  and howard keel ,  in only his second film ,  must manage to act like these are human beings he's relating to )  .take a look at betty hutton's reaction upon seeing howard keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered  " a bit much "  if seen from the back row of an amphitheater .  at best ,  her performance is clownlike ;  at worst ,  it's apelike .  little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity .  it's a magnificent effort ,  and a stunning testimony to her desire to please ,  but her comedy has no reality ,  no nuance ,  no connection to any sincere emotion .  she seizes on  " hick "  and drives that into the ground ,  then she plays nothing but  " infatuated "  for a while before toggling to  " resentful "  and so forth  .  .  .  it's a series of masks and set pieces ,  but it's not a character .  judy garland was in sad shape at that point in her life ,  but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind annie's rootin'-tootinest moments ,  and she wouldn't have neglected annie's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes .  nobody can do vulnerability like judy ,  and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character .  annie could be a wonderful character ,  a great self-conflicted mess of strength ,  longing ,  guts ,  femininity ,  skill ,  naivete and worldiness ,  all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead betty hutton makes her a pop-eyed ,  crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet .  i am surprised that hutton didn't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out .  maybe they just wouldn't let her .  the scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh ,  oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide .i kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on ,  and the memory of betty hutton's performance is branded on my brain ,  but it's because this performance seems like it's following the traditions of some other culture ,  some other world .  it's like going to a sideshow .that said ,  the tunes are a non-stop parade of hits -- there probably isn't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another ,  in wildly different styles ,  with effective melodies worth remembering .  the classic tunes just keep coming .  the movie works as spectacle and songfest ,  and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness .  but if you're looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations ,  you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes .
this movie was a bit lame for me .   robin williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie ,  and the supporting cast wasn't much better ,  but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen .   even if this had been a good movie ,  the green screen was very distracting .   i would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff
one of the worst films of a generation .   many talented comedic   ( dave thomas - colleen camp )  were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral .
then why not take some responsibility as a parent and encourage the kids to sing something else ?   the songs are fairly cloying adaptations of the originals ,  which arguably weren't that bad  (  " what a girl wants "  and  " get this party started "  were fairly tame to begin with )  .   just encourage the little ones to listen to classical music if you fear the outside world will corrupt their minds
between the not so below average acting of thomas and biel ,  the film might have benefited more from a better script ,  but it did not .   there was nothing in this movie that they could have done better ,  it was just a fluff holiday movie that a family would most likely not want to watch that much
i was under the impression that this was the entire series .  i finally ,  after many issues ,  got my set and unwrapped it ,  and my heart sank audibly when i saw  " complete collection i "  .  i popped the last disk in and lo and behold ,  it wasn't the full series afterall .
terrible direction ,  terrible writing ,  it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with .  although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie clue ,  it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid .  it was a total watse of good celluloid
almost unbelievably bad ,  except i saw the remake of 'shaft , ' which should have been a forewarning .   this is like a comic book for filmgoers .   no ,  not a graphic novel adapted to the screen .   more like a comic book for kids ,  that you'd be embarassed to own at any age .   doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack ,  a travesty to the nth degree .
he kept it real thats all i can say .  aw yeah those people talkin bout its too much cussin .  what u expect im from the hood and every other word i say is a cuss word .  i just cant help it .  everybody in the hood cusses .  but anyways .  .
personally ,  i found this workout extremely difficult to follow ;  the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood .  after pushing myself to go back to every part i didn't understand ,  i grew frustrated .  other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition ,   as i have obviously tried ,  but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill ,  both of which i believe are integral to any workout .  and in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output ;  one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves .to a less significant degree ,  i agree with the reviews that comment on the  " cheesiness "  of the video .  at first ,  such cheesiness made me laugh ,  and then as i grew frustrated ,  it merely made me further annoyed .  what i feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor marie forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts ,  which are not only redundant ,  but suggestive in a most unnecessary way .i don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--i just wish i had been able to learn the moves ,  because they did look like fun
the entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched ,  it is actually completely false .   the concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with whom is murdered  ( or is otherwise the victim )  ,  but what you did ,  in distinct criminal incidents .   even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone ,  if you go back and murder them  " again "  then that is a new incident ,  and double jeopardy does not apply .in movies intended to be fantastic ,  diverging this much from reality might be ok .   but this is a mainstream legal thriller .   it's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don't ,  for no apparent reason .but the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means ,  or they just  ( accurately )  banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is
there are no words to describe how awful  (  !  !  !  )  this  " movie "  was from beginning to end ,  but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined :  the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is  " touched "  by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle .  .  .  need i say more ?the plot ,  the  " humor ,  "  the dialogues ,  and the music are way beyond  " below average .  "there is next to no nudity and there are no ,  i mean 0 as in zero beautiful girls ,  in this film !as for the acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words .  .  .school plays  ( and pre-school for that matter )  have better actors !   it is truly sad .  .  .rent or buy  ( ha ha ha )  at your own risk .   you have been warned !
i only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the twins .  really bad acting and plot that makes little sense .  trying to be like the original movie but falls way short .  its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters .  not worth it except for the brief shower scene .
i read some good reviews about this movie .  in adition ,  i respect french's cinema ,  they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies .  so ,  i bought  " spanish apartment "  .a big dissapointment .  hughe one .it's candid ,  it's  " naive "  ,  it's boring ,  with poor ideas ,  poor acting ,  very predictable .  there's a lot of good movies around you ,  don't waste your time in this one
unlike many ,  i hadn't seen this film when it first came out .   so it was with much anticipation that i recently sat down to watch it .   well ,  it stunk .   what a disappointment .   the only really good thing in there is leo mckern ,  who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue .   show 'em how it's done ,  leo .michelle pfeiffer is beautiful to look at ,  but her role is limited .   matthew broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career ,  and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever ,  which hampers the film ,  since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief .   fortunately ,  he has come a long way as an actor since then .   rutger hauer is just plain bad .in defense of the director and crew ,  the film is prettily shot  ( with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene )  in well lit ,  scenic locations .otherwise ,  i would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations .
i usually trust amazon reviewers on movie reviews ,  but this time  .  .  .  . no way !    this silly ,  totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment ,  hoping the movie would liven up .   sadly ,  it didn't .  to those who rave about the film .  .  . you must be in another dimension or something .   thumbs down .
fyi- this is the  " retail-friendly "  edited version of guys gone wild :  heatstroke to show less raunchy material ,  making it acceptable at mainstream retailers .  be sure to get  " heatstroke "  instead if you want the full uncensored version of this title
for the idiot that wrote that day 1 for fifty was in 2003 .  .  .  . stay in da south .  . ur abviously dont know that fifty has been on the seen since 98 u idoit .   ur a fake rap fan and u should know ya history instead of talking on curtis jackson .  .  .  . 2003 .  . what a douche bag .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
cinema-wise ,  you know you're witnessing the beginning of the end when the best hollywood can come up with is a sequel to a remake  ( it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film )  .   but that is exactly what  " cheaper by the dozen 2 "  turns out to be - and the result ,  quality-wise ,  is pretty much what one would expect .this is one of those alleged family comedies in which the adults  ( the male adults at any rate )  are infinitely more immature in their attitude and behavior than the children they are raising .   steve martin returns as the prolific father of twelve who is beginning to sense that his children ,  as they are growing older ,  no longer want to spend quality time together as a family .   to rectify the situation ,  he takes them all on a vacation to a favorite lake resort - a move that threatens to turn into a full-scale disaster when the bakers find themselves embroiled in a fierce competition with a neighboring family of snooty overachievers led by eugene levy ,  a patriarch who runs his brood with so much spit-and-polish regimentation that he makes captain von trapp look like a touchy-feely pushover in comparison .one might be tempted to call this a distended version of a  " brady bunch "  episode and leave it at that ,  but even that show ,  for all its lack of sophistication ,  didn't portray the father as a total and irredeemable doofus with serious developmental issues and the emotional maturity of a bratty six-year-old .     besides the daddy-is-a-dope stereotype ,  all  " cheaper by the dozen 2 "  has to offer is lame slapstick ,  a silly pre-pubescent  " romeo and juliet "  subplot ,  and push-button scenes of emotional uplift in which a crescendo of swelling violins serves as the cue for the tears to start flowing .   the drearily unoriginal screenplay comes replete with the requisite dog-humping incidents and poop jokes ,  and not one but two scenes of an elderly handicapped gentleman rolling off into the lake in a wheelchair .any more of these films and planned parenthood won't have to mount a fundraising drive for years to come
here's the  " awful truth "  :that you would be willing to let this man ,  a raving ,  terminally obese ,  incoherent highschool dropout ,  who is to truth what a lead block smeared with ketchup is to cheesecake---that you would let this man literally plunge his hamburger-grease stained mitts into your skull ,  forming the mushy stuff of your brain into little foamy pink chunks of liberal pabulum .and that you would pay him money to render the service !yes ,  you could watch all of the episodes in  " the awful truth "  :  you would ,  no doubt ,  feel smug and superior to all those unenlightened troglodytes who voted for bush .  you might giggle a bit ,  which is a common side-effect of a political lobotomy .but at the end of the day ,  it is far better that you take your lead from antiquity :  when oedipus realized his own version of the  " awful truth " ---that he had whacked pa ,  gotten jiggy with ma ,  and generally made an a** of himself---he stabbed out his own eyeballs .might i recommend the white-hot iron pokers ?js
personally ,  i found 8 1/2 to be one of the most boring films i've ever seen .   it was a pretentious ,  self-indulgent trip down the director's memory lane .   i understood the plot ,  and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end ,  but overall was bored silly by stilted ,  pointless dialogue .having said that ,  the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching .   perhaps 8 1/2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment  : p
in the early 1990's this movie was definitely made for that era .  just look at the clothing and hair .  high top fades etc .  graffiti bridge was definitely unique .  it should have been released on cable t . v .  instead of the theater .  it was more of a musical then a actual movie .  prince somehow has his own ways of doing things in his own world .  and he may not care about record sales or what people think of what he puts out ,  but it makes even the most loyal fans question what he is doing .  the talent he has is amazing but he's become just a mediocur artist .  this lack luster film may be remembered a hundred years from now .  but as of now it's just what you call a get up and walk out film .  i'm a prince fanatic ,  a die hard fan ,  but man the potential this guy has to be a mega star of our time he fails to meet .  you haft to make people believe in you and really reach them and relate .  if only prince could relate to what people are feeling now and what they want .  prince somehow fell behind because the youth of this generation moved on while he stayed stagnet .  i think he shut the world out and it just went on turning .  record sales may not matter to him ,  but fans you must keep loyal .  graffiti bridge is a film in my collection and i just look at it as my collection but nothing more .  it's a film that makes you think .  it's spiritual and there are some warm moments .  now purple rain is something not to be missed .  i recommend that one .  enjoy
denise austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults .  this video isn't kid friendly ,  and doesn't have a good feel for kids .  to be honest ,  it is very close to most of denise's exercise videos for adults .  what denise has forgotten ,  or may have never known ,  is kids are kids ,  and they need to be treated accordingly ,  and that means with exercise videos to .a good choice for kids is - kick to get fit jr .  -for kids ,  this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional ,  not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids ,  and just hoping they can do them .my kids are not at all happy with this program .   there are 6 & 10 years old ,  and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes ,  mostly because they didn't understand the movements ,  and then found most of the other movements very hard to do .  once again ,  the forgotten point - kids are kids ,  and they need to be treated accordingly .  one last point ,  in the video denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness .  this is all good except they all forgot one very important detail , -  you must be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand .  just because you know something about exercise ,  it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children .  knowledge is one thing - teaching & instructing is another ,  and the fact is ,  some people are just not very good at instructing children .  a point that is very clearly displayed within this program .
i found this movie to be almost unwatchable .   if your idea of a good time is watching henry gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes ,  then this movie is for you .   the three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it .   altman can pull off such greats as  " mash "  and   " godsford park "  and then stink up the joint with this .   what's up with that
saw this as an inflight movie .  boy ,  did i pray for engine trouble ,  so we'd have to land and i could get away !  sucks or what ?  i liked smith in 'i ,  robot' ,  'independence day' ,  etc ,  but this was awful .  it's a one-joke movie .  problem is ,  the one joke was the one plastered all over the tv spots and trailers  ( the jet ski incident )  .  the highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool - wish that'd been the main storyline instead - far ,  far superior !  will not be adding this to my wishlist
don't let the cover fool you ,  this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is .  maybe it's my own fault ,  but i was expecting something more like  " groove "  ,  or at least something interesting to watch .  and it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands ,  i often listen to joy division/new order/happy mondays ,  and more from that scene .  however ,  this seemed much more like the story of tony wilson and the factory ,  than it did about the music ,  and almost came-off as a documentary .  i almost stopped watching it out of boredom ,  but saw it through anyway .  now i wouldn't call this bad ,  it had it's good parts ,  just not many .
definatly one of the worst movies ever .   the dialog is so boring i had an a . d . d .  attack trying to watch it .   i usally never turn a movie off in the middle but i had to do it with this one .  i tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it ,  so i would never have to suffer through this again .   the characters are so lame i did'nt even care about who was threating his life .   i wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already .   man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it .  it fu**in sucks !  !  !  !  !  and it is really dated
sat down and saw this one on televion .only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money .what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement .  slanders the u-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders .  other than allied propoganda pieces ,  there are no incidents of u-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats .the movie itself i have little respect .  basicly plotless and  unrealistic .  action scenes unbelievable .  characters two dimensional .this film awful .
i was not into this movie at all .   my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through .   a middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life ,  so he takes a dance class .   ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor ,  a crush is pursued ,  a wife gets jealous ,  hires a detective ,  and *gasp* his crush is found out .   the movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me .   not a bad movie ,  just not my cup of tea .   richard gere was cute as usual ,  which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end ,  besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since  " so you think you can dance "  never had contestants who mastered it
this movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre ,  far less interesting than pulp fiction and even below the level of reservoir dogs .  it is said that in the violent late middle ages street shows were  often staged in european cities where fake blood flowed like water ,  heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines  during an evisceration delighting  the crowd .  it seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come  full circle from barbara tuchman's gripping account of the  awful fourteenth century .   despite the abundant gore if the film had been  better handled it could have been quite good .  there are  glimpses of its failed potential at different  points .  for instance the scene  towards the end where the prison governor's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct  copy of an actual event at the  bastille during the days of the early french revolution .  in sum ,  as a special kind of disgusting  art form it is interesting ,  as entertainment though natural born killers sucks .  i admit some  people will like it  ,  no doubt the same crowd who would attend  public executions if they were available for viewing
i'm sorry folks ,  but i went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen .   it would be a tremendous understatement to say i was disappointed .    this film is horrible in nearly every respect ,  but this is the film's fatal flaw :  a  " character study "  is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature .the film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice .   sorry to bring up the obvious here ,  but the only thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping .   he would not be pre-occupied with helping defend the police station  ( he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun )  ;  he would not be worried about  " his chances out there "   ( remember he's on death row )  ;  he would be concerned only with escaping immediately .sorry to all you fans of this  " cult classic "  ,  but a movie in this vein must be at least somewhat realistic to gain my praise .   this one is a mess .
" killing me softly "  has one of those scripts that just don't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation ,  but the big  " twist "  at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable  ( unless perhaps you haven't seen a thriller before in your life )  .  the chemistry between the two leads is also lacking ;  fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned ,  he's an inexpressive bloke ,  while heather graham is all too expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera .  besides ,  she's not even that attractive ;  even her co-star in this particular film ,  natascha mcelhone ,  blows her out of the water in that department .  the ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth ,  sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour .  it was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did ,  i have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quicklyin spite of all that ,  chen kaige's direction is good ,  and he creates some suspenseful moments .  so i give the film a generous  " ** out of 5 "  rating .  but if you're a heather graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes ;  and for joseph fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks .
ernest borgnine would be spinning in his grave if he were dead .   there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie !   the actors should be embarrassed !   i could only stomach 25 minutes of viewing and it was about as funny as a viewing in a mortuary .   i can't believe i paid $9 . 99 for this dvd .   what a fool i was .   learn from my mistake
this review might contain some spoilers .  .  .  . i was disappointed with this anime .  after all the reviews i read i was expecting alot more .  it was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over .  there was some humor but all in all i would not waste money on it .  infact ,  i took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after i purchased it
i don't know how i managed to see this gory splatterfest twice in college . it's a terrible movie  ( next to that other awful movie  " wild wild west "  which also stars salma hayek )quentin tarantino&george clooney play a pair of ne'er do wells who take a family hostage . they end up going to a strip joint filled with evil vampires .  .  . and battling them until dawn . turns out that the strip joint is built on top of an aztec temple , hence the bloodsucking strippers .george clooney managed to overcome this , as well as  " batman&robin "  to get into  " syriana " & " good night , and good luck .  "  he's a talented actor ; too bad he couldn't save this movie through sheer charm . when it comes to heists , he's better in  " ocean'e eleven "  as a dapper casino-robbing metrosexual .avoid this movie , unless you really like gruesome , violent movies .  .
despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie ,  this is really pretty sick stuff ,  with little or no redeeming social context .   objectively ,  sick just isn't erotic ,  no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so .   those who think differently really ought to either :    ( a )  focus a little more ;   ( b )  examine their true motives ;  or  ( c )  get a life
the sound on this dvd is absolutely horrible .   the dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects ,  making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering .   i also have the vhs ,  on which the sound is perfect ,  so i can still watch this wonderful movie .   but i would sure like to get my money back for the dvd
this is the type of yoga that gives yoga a bad name .  i will not even give this one to a student or friend ;  put it in the goodwill bag
i have only one question about this movie .  and that is ,  why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book ?if you haven't read the book than you don't know what i'm talking about .  but if you have ,  then you do .i can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly .  half the time while watching this ,  i felt as if i was watching teletubies or something ,  the colors were so bright .if this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes ,  locations ,  characters ,  and details from the story , then everyone would love it .  not just 5 year olds .it makes me so angry when i watch this movie .  yes ,  its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing .  everytime i loan someone the book ,  i have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all .  in fact ,  it is a hundred times better .  more even .i am really disappointed .  i just don't get how gail carson levine would agree to all the changes that were made .  if someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie ,  than i suggest they do it right .  and if they do ,  then i'll be very thankful .i just don't get it .  the book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better .  you wouldn't believe how much better it is .i am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book .  next time ,  please ,  please ,  do it right
i bought this movie without seeing it first and have now watch it at least two times through .  some chapters ,  i watch several more times .this movie has three things against it .  first ,  i was very disappointed with the number of product placements in this movie .  it takes alot away from the whole movie .  second ,  it has too much of the same stuff that can be seen in any recently released wm movie .  same people doing the same exact things .  third ,  the sound track was way below par .i'm still a warren miller fan and the movie does have some good ski footage .  but ,  i don't think the wm bunch went out of their way to make this a good ski movie .
can someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered dvd version of this film with chinese audio and english subtitles ?   the recent hong kong legends release is crazy :  chinese audio ,  or english audio ,  but no english subtitles !i have the original chinese language/english subtitled  ( the subtitles are imbedded )  version of this movie on a universe vcd and ,  based on the merits of its available chinese audio/english subtitles alone ,  it is a better movie--by magnitudes--than the one ( s )  commercially available to the  ( hapless )  u . s .  market .the english dubbing on this dvd ,  even though well synchronized with the actors' lips ,  takes so much away from the film nevertheless ,  especially its  " chinese-ness ,  "  which is a major reason i enjoy this movie genre .   take ,  for example ,  the scene where our hero first returns to jing woo school after learning of his master's death and sees first senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master .   after handily defeating the challenger ,  first senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the english soundtrack completely  ( and deplorably )  misses .   also ,  at the very end of the u . s .  release film ,  chen says he is going back to his japanese girlfriend .   in the original ,  hong kong release ,  he actually goes off to fight the japanese with the resistance movement .   between these two examples ,  there are many such ,  gross audio mis-cues ;  enough ,  at least ,  to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film :  the best of jet li's filmography ,  and perhaps the best of the  " modern "  martial arts genre ,  period .the same criticism holds true for jet li's the tai chi master  ( released in the u . s .  as the english-dubbed twin warriors )  .   it's an english soundtrack superimposed over a chinese movie ,  often stripping the film of its unique cultural content/identity/nuance ,  forcing the film through an american  " knock-down-shoot-'em-up "  template and reducing the potential for mental  ( as opposed to strictly visceral )  enjoyment to a pitiful minimum .   we end up with a film typically devoid of humor ,  character development and silver screen  " intimacy ,  "  a film precariously out of balance with ,  and far flung from ,  its careful directorial intent .if you value the full content--visible and audible--of chinese martial arts films ,  but lack facility in the host language ,  then the next best thing is a well-subtitled ,  original language version .   and this release clearly is not that--by a long ,  long ,  long shot .
watching this movie ,  i am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible ,  and make it drag out on the screen .   the disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds .   watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be ,  and how poor direction ,  and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness .   i won't even go into historical inaccuracies ,  or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early .   makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject ,  the audience and history instead of respect
20 years ago ,  there was a terrible accident in the mine on valentine's day .  the following year one of the miners ,  harry warden ,  takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident .  since that day ,  there is no celebration of valentine's day in the little town valentine's buff .  until now  ( that is 1981 )  .  but harry warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration .the music as music is quite good ,  but it doesn't lead the film in any direction ,  so it's not helping .  the story is recycled ,  which is good ,  but could have been much more minimalistic .  why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids ?  and trying to put a twist to the story by  " explaining "  things is seldom very helpful .  the murderar places human hearts in valentine boxes which is distasteful but not really scary .a variation on the holiday theme ,  that could have been a bit more focused .
what the he77 was that ?  ?  ?  yo i tried cam ,  your music is straight and all but hang up the camera and pick up the mic .  stick to your day job  ( rapping )  .
both sides of disc 5 are unplayable .   all others are o
old movies are great .   i've been waiting for the release of oklahoma !  in the new technology dvd format - i wanted to use my new dvd up-converter .   i have the laser disk version ,  and after reading the reviews ,  i will keep it until fox gets its act totether .   fox should have a press release when they fix the problems reviewed here - until i know it's at least as good as my outdated laser disk ,  i'll wait
the concept of this movie looked interesting but as the story unfolded  " the girl in the cafe "  turned out to be a left-wing political message .   i wonder if the writer of this movie realized the blatant hypocrisy in the character  " gina "  ?   gina browbeats the members of the g8 conference over the terrible poverty and suffering in the world ,  particularly involving children while she initiates a sexual relationship with a man she barely knows .   does the thought ever cross her mind  ( or the person writing the script ?  )  that casual sex is one of the primary reasons for the rampant spread of hiv/aids ,  all varieties of venereal disease ,  children born out of wedlock ,  etc ?   maybe gina should look at her own life before judging other so harshly .this movie is unrated at the time of this writing but would likely receive an r rating for nudity and language
i just wanted to find out and please let me know dat is the a*teens music video  " heartbreak lullaby "  which is part of the soundtrack for the movie on the princess diaries dvd  .  . lyke as in the bonus features or something ?  ?  ive been trying find out but i cant so plzz lemme know cuz i just wanna get the dvd for the music video !  !
the book of acts is a book of power !   sadly ,  this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation .   the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak  ( acting )  rendition of the story .   thankfully ,  it is word for word from the bible ,  which is why i gave it two stars .   reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers .   all of that is lost in the dvd presentation .i would not recommend this dvd .   stick to the book instead
the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life .   i found myself saying  " oh come on "  to one plot point after another  ( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities )  .   the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving  ( previous reviews in this thread provide details )
i guess i hold the minorty here in thinking the north and south  " maxie-series "  is just the worst civil war mini-series ever put on film .  they took great source material and turned it into  " days of our civil war lives "  ,  a soap opera of the most unwanted kind .  i found myself hopeing that maybe it would get better but it got more unbelievible as it went on  .  just a waste of a great cast and a lot of money
this is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times .  the owens girls are hereditary witches ,  any man who loves one is doomed to an early death .  there is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion ,  this requires the sacrifice of a dove .  two little girls watch .  years later they're grown up .  one leaves to live with her boyfriend .  but the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck  ( never stand in the middle of a road )  .  we see scenes where the neighbor kids yell  " witch "  ,  as if to symbolize something .sally goes when jillian calls her ;  she has a problem with her boyfriend .  but sally uses a  " magic potion "  to eliminate the problem .  now jillian wants to undo what was done .   [ the film began to lose me now ,  it wasn't funny .  ]  the spell goes awry ,  they bury their mistake .  then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles .  later an investigator comes around looking for jimmy .   [ the story drags again .  ]  more scenes follow ;  they are not funny or scary or even entertaining .  but a scene in the attic will wake you even if you're snoozing !  they call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of jillian .  it seems to work ,  even if they don't use the standard issue witches broom .  there is a sort of happy ending .sandra and nicole are good actresses ,  but they can't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies i've ever seen .   " bell ,  book ,  and candle "  is a funnier film ,   " blair witch "  is a scarier film .  this falls between the cracks .
how could mr .  cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody ?the production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos ,  but the script and dialogue are so banal ,  the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another .   ( including leo ,  who was so good in  " what's eating gilbert grape ?  "  in 1993 when i didn't yet know who he was ,  i thought he was really a cute little retarded kid .  .  .  yet in  " titanic "  ,  there's just nothing there--- or nothing permitted )  .talk about a ship wreck !  !only the two studio-backed block voting resulted in the record-tying oscar wins/nominations .
the slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy .  unintelligible at time .  .  .  . not what the books are about
i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard  ( of sports night fame )  was scowling hard ,  trying to be a tough detroit cop .  not believable for a nanosecond .  and then it got worse when marky mark said ,   " why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee ?  "the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clich�d rhythm .  almost every scene in this thing is a howler .  and watching it ,  i remembered i hadn't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was 2 fast 2 furious .  still ,  tyrese is better than garrett hedlund ,  who looks like he's a refugee from the outsiders .but the movie's not a total wash ;  after all ,  it's got a great soundtrack
waste of time .   i turned it off .   the  " extra features "  were slightly interesting .   the actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing .   a vanity piece .   why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating ,  badly-written melodrama .   don't bother
the only reason why i saw this was because of susannah york .  this shows she was more capable of the dix she played in &quot ; the killing of sister george&quot ;  and was a fine actress .  otherwise this movie is blah .  it's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting .  the men in this movie are so disgusting one can't blame her for getting mad anyway .  for another pointless film of this caliber see secret ceremony
i expected so much more ,  because it's marshall ,  but regardless of where you purchase this ,  it's edited .  it's pathetic .  this is eminem !  i understand you have a daughter mr .  mathers ,  but do not make all of us watch an edited concert .  this is probably the most ridiculous thing i've ever bought .  there's not even a warning that it's censored .  you just buy it ,  pop it in your dvd player ,  and listen to a concert with mostly every other word jarbled up .  it's a useless dvd .  there's no point in buying it .  first encore ,  now this .  i've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90's .  as somebody from michigan ,  i saw him before he was mr .  cartier global super star buying skin treatments at barneys .  i've never been more disappointed with an artist .
royal wedding isn't on dvd yet .  that's because the owner of the film ,  warner bros .  hasn't released it yet .but several other companies have ,  under the  " guise "  of public domain .  the original copyright on the film was not renewed properly with the library of congress ,  so the film is perceived to be public domain ,  although the music is very much copyrighted and every distributor of this movie is participating in copyright infringement by selling these  " bootlegs "  .the companies make the money ,  because they're selling other people's property .the people who ultimately suffer are you ,  the consumer ,  unknowingly buying products of inferior  ( worse than professional vhs )  quality ,  thinking you're getting the real thing ,  because it's a dvd .save your money .  wait until warner bros .  gives us the real thingthing .  .  .and by the way ,  the movie gets 4 stars ,  it's the cheapo bootleg dvd that gets 1 star !
this has got to be the biggest stinker in denzel's long movie career ,  just after the oscar winning philadelphia ,  he went on to star in this cult sci fi movie based on machines outsmarting mankind in a virtual reality game ,  russel crowe also stars in this very ,  and i mean very bad movie .  but hey ,  if you're a sci fi fan ,  watch this ,  but don't expect high rated acting from any of the two big stars .  on account ,  this movie didn't make any sufficent funds at the box office and was later labeled by the hollywood critic ,  the only movie with two lead star to not hit the box office .  this low budget sleepy movie isn't worth watching ,  if you love sci fi ,  that outakes the life of machines aginst the human race ,  pick up a true 5 star hollywood material like ,  'a . i' ,  'terminator' 'i' ,  'ii' ,  'iii' or will smith's new movie ,  'i ,  robot'
if you're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill ,  this is &quot ; not&quot ;  the video for you .  however ,  if you want a training video on big wave surfing ,  go ahead .  a better video for the stoke would be the classic endless summer 2 .  much more of a better buy .  billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in odyssey about tow-in surfing ,  training on watercrafts ,  and then they get to the surfing .  i fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it .  i had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing .  nice documentary for discovery channel ,  not for the wired surf enthusiast .  so
this dvd sucks ,  all the  " fights "  are fake ,  retarted ,  drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time i've ever had in my life .   i am now stupider for watching this dvd and buying it is on my list of regrets i have in life .   i wish i could say the only good part was .  .  .  .  but there was no good part .   no shirts ripped off or good hits thrown ,  nothing .   i am a marine stationed in japan looking for a dvd to enjoy and this is what i get .   where is the love
this disc is like a whitman's candy sampler :   it has a lot of different things .  .  .  but a lot of the things you don't really want .   the film covers kids ,  high schoolers ,  college ball and college recruiting/pay controversies ,  aba ,  nba through all its decades ,  harlem globetrotters ,  the street game and inner-city stars ,  country boys ,  indiana basketball ,  retired old timers hanging in florida ,  current stars ,  marketing  ( are there any hoop videos that don't talk about sneaker brands )  ,  public relations ,  fireworks ,  cheerleaders ,  guys on trampolines ,  women's basketball .  .  .  .  .  whew .   none of these subjects is studied in depth .   if you've followed basketball for a while ,  you know and have seen most of this .   the subject sampling seems to jump all over the place ,  so it would be hard to hit chapters to see just what you want .   i'd rather see a dvd star profile  ( jordon ,  iverson )  or &quot ; nba at 50&quot ;  or spike lee's movie ,  or &quot ; hoop dreams , &quot ;  etc .   1 love is such a sampler it feels like the disc should come free with the purchase of a wilson basketball .   or it seems like something you'd see on sunday tv ,  after most people have turned off their sets when the real game ends .   in short ,  &quot ; 1 love&quot ;  is a decent sampling ,  but nothing to sink your teeth into
if your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of  " end of the century "  or  " filth and the fury "  this ain't it !   picture taking 40 hours of bad home video  ( really awful sound )  and editing together and calling it a documentary .  no current interviews ,  no voice over making any sense of the chaos .  .  . no thought to flow or storyline ,  just a mishmash of stuff banged together .  a real dissapointment .  the saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it ,  this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance .  i've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due .  its a shame this is what its been reduced to .  shame on everyone involved
strengths :  soundtrack by christopher franke ,  performance by andreas katsulas in 1st half .  interesting idea of weapons system .weaknesses :  plot was mostly stupid .  tragic underutilization of g'kar as a character in the second half .  unconvincing sense of scale for the leanndra  ( why call for  " a healer "  ?  how many healers are on board this tiny ship ?  )  .  felt more like a pilot for a new series than a standalone movie
all of us have a dark side .   unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane's life and expands it out of proportion .   in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane's life and career as window dressing .   even the screenplay is ,  at best ,  an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h .  carpernter  -- since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice-accused murder suspect .in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane's extracurricular activities .   my interest in the film was as a hogan's heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six-year series .   bob crane's professional credits alone would make for a good film .   auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane's so-called  " secret life "  and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd .facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane's private life .   auto focus ,  however ,  should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine .   you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan's heroes television series .
i live in south africa where the series appeared 20 years ago . thanks to amazon i was able to relive the wonder of archie bunker where each episode provides laughs from one of the family , each of whom is brilliantly cast . i have series 3&4 and now want 1&2 . don't wait any longer , 24 episodes of absolute delight await you
this story is one of the worst  " fantasy "  stories ever .   it is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo-christian story line .   don't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to lord of the rings or harry potter for original  ( not to mention secular )  fantasy and escape .

i have been a long-time radiohead fan and ,  like many others ,  have been waiting patiently for a live dvd .   so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist .   it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old !i couldn't help being disappointed when i watched this dvd .   the constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch .   in fact ,  i only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust .   i know i would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime .i've always that radiohead was modern ,  progressive ,  and totally innovative .    i appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey .  .  .  and it doesn't help that before every song ,  thom mutters  " this is a new one .  "

this experience was totally unsatisfactory !  !  !   i received a notice that the product had been shipped ;   it included a very long number to trace the shipment .  it was promised for february 6th ,  but did not arrive .  on february 16th you wrote me that the shipment was never made .   now which is it ?   did you have it ,  and misplace it in the process ,  or did you lie when you said it was already send out ?   i have had otherwise good results in  my purchases from amazon ,   but this is a real mess-up .  i wrote to ask how to reorder ,  and this is the only response since then .   is there anything you can do to change this problem .  ?  do you reprint reviews of your service
the only extraordinary thing about this film is how ow could take such a fascinating subject and drain the life out of it .   i found myself wanting this to be over about halfway through  ( after i dozed off )  .   don't be fooled by the other review here .   they are the true fakes  ( if you know what i mean )  .   save your money and save your time
so-so story about a man's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star's mother .like that old dickie roberts movie ,  it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars ,  but does not do a good job of it .mickey rooney and shirley temple ,  where are you when we need you ?
alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority .  the character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by aristotle .  watching this movie you get the feeling that alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident .there is far too much emphasis here on the non-essential ,  and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of alexander's strained relationships with his mother ,  father ,  friends and his own identity .  if you're looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient greece ,  look elsewhere .  this is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant .
it's a disgrace they charge money for this dvd .  producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold .fine if people want to experiment with filmmaking ,  but to release this film with big name actors and charge consumer ,  unforgivable .i prefer to have rated this with no stars
after i read erik larson's wonderful book  " the devil in the white city "  i was fascinated by the brief glimpses at holmes' story .  but this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment .  the production is amateurish at best ,  complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of  " mondo carne .  "  with such a wealth of fascinating information available  ( court transcripts ,  etc )  do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened ?  this man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the haunted mansion at disneyland .  truly disappointing .  perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of holmes .  this most certainly isn't it
i was very disappointed with steve's performance .   eventhough it took a lot out of him to refrain from swearing ,  his material towards the end of the show began to dwindle to the point that it just became plain ignorant ,  especially in the part where he was expressing how he would  " kill someone "  ,  etc .  ,  and gloating bout it .   after i bought it ,  i later caught it on a cable network .   god may not be  " through with him yet "  ,  but it will be up to him  ( steve )  to repent on his own .   this may be good humor for a more complacent christian audience
absolute dog poop - with corn .  so there is this joke that all the comedians know about ,  and there are a million ways to tell it ,  and they get really raunchy .  there ,  that's the movie .  i saved you two hours .  oh but there's a kicker ,  the joke isn't funny and everyone knows it .  yet ,  of course ,  some of the comedians tell it like it's the funniest thing in the world - sarah silverman ,  gilbert godfried ,  bob sagat ,  and south park are definite highlights .  and i love sarah silverman .  however ,  the awful cinematography ,  horrific editing ,  and terrible production value of this film make impossible for me to fathom why people didn't burn down the theaters when they realized this film wasn't getting any better .  i would have at least demanded a refund ,  and $100/hr billed in 15 minute increments .  i think sarah silverman saved the day again
i picked this set up despite reservations  ( reservations being luke perry and the guy from the cosby show )  because of the creator j .  michael straczynski .  unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff .it's really nothing more then a c average show .  normally that's not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel  ( showtime )  and costs over $70 . 00 on dvd it's just not good enough .specific problems i had with the show include a lot of filler episodes .  the season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line .  the show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story  ( this is the model that hbo uses )  .production value is also sorely lacking .  once again i'm going to compare to hbo  ( i feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks )  .  the hbo series carnivale has unbelievable production value ,  the set's ,  locations ,  costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality  ( the same can be said for deadwood and rome but carnival makes for a better comparison )  .  but jeremiah all looks the same .  you can tell the show was all shot in the same location ,  every back road and town look like they are in the same county .the biggest problem however is just the premise .  a post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get's tired fast .  i had to force myself through the last 9 episodes .  luke perry's quest to find valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery .  simon's quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled .  so basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent .  plus if you need any other reason to dislike this show then know that jason presley makes a guest appearance  ( just what this show needed a 90210 reunion )  .if you're looking for a great show this is not it .  if you can watch it cheap give a whirl but don't waste any hard earned cash on this one
saw this movie at the actual premier in nyc and met sturla gunnerson and i told him exactly how i felt .  gerard butler needed a bigger horse .  i expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater .  sarah polleys language was uncalled for in the film .  they could have written better lines .  the fade in ,  fade out was like a child filming with a video camera .  the film was funny at times and mixed with gore .  like eating sweet and sour .  being a gerard butler fan i was distressed after watching this film .  why did he do this ?  gerry butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes .  this unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like the jury ,  please or the phantom of the opera .  i expect mr .  butler to be past these b films and know he does have much better stuff in the works .  .  . than goodness .all in all the film was terrible .  the scenery was captivating and breathless .  i at times found myself saying wow ,  but it was about the story of beowulf & grendel and it did not meet my expectations that i have read even in the easiest translations .  all i can say is mr .  butler your an incredible talent ,  becareful what you choose .  movies like this can paved the way to a downward spiral .  i know mr .  butler is indeed better than this .
i found this dvd to be very slow .  there is only one workout on the tape and it is only 20 minutes long .  most of this time is spent talking ,  not streching
terrible voice ,  depressing indoor scenery ,  incredibly disjointed routines .  don't bother with this one !  save your money
let me break it down for you in a nutshell ,  people .  it's a murder mystery in which the film's protaganist thinks she knows who the killer is .  but ,  she has her doubts .  but she saw a tatto of a spade on the guy's arm .  he has the same thing .  but what does she do ?  she has sex with him .  sex ,  sex ,  and more sex .  if you suspect somebody of being a killer than why on earth would you have sex with him ?  plus ,  50% of the movie is just plain old sex and sex talk .  i don't think this was a perfectly planned movie ,  to tell you the truth .final verdict :  it's easily forgetable and needs to go right before it starts
i wouldn't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that i had to when i saw what christiane schmidt had to say .now we all know mr gibson has got issues with the british  ( as well as others )  - just look at that other pile of tosh - braveheart .  but here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous .  the usual response is  " it's not history but hollywood ,  it's fiction based on historical events "  .  but the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that !now i'm sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war ,  but i've never read of the british burning down churches with people inside - nazis ,  yes .  .  .  . british ,  no .  but who cares about whether it really happened .  .  .  . it's only a film !  !good grief ,  next thing you know they'll be making a film about the us recovering the first enigma machine .  .  .  .  . oops .
this is the worst workout tape that i have ever purchase ,  the trainer switches moves to quick and doesnt explain what she is doing like she expects you to know before hand what she is about to do .  i am personally gonna smash my copy of it .  only reason i gave it 1 star is because the ratings dont go lower
i am a big fan of woody allen and i presume that i will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies .   prior to viewing  " what's new pussycat ?  "  ,  i would have presumed that i would enjoy each and every movie .   however ,   " what's new pussycat ?  "  has shown me that even woody allen can make a disaster movie .what is wrong with this movie is just about everything .   the acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up .   we start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees .   peter o'toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women .   he proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous .   he calls all his femine friends  " pussycat "  which gets old after a while .   he constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather interested/disinterested approach toward his playmates .   he seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by peter sellers .   sellers does his best with what little he has to work with .   he has the dr .  strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times .   woody allen wrote the script ,  which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture .   i once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3 .   with woody allen ,  the comedian said ,  you can use all 10 .   in  " what's new pussycat ?  "  ,  i wish there had been at least three good jokes .   this overlong look into the problems that o'toole's character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of bennie hill-style slapstick .   i take that back ;  there's no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of bennie hill by associating it with this turkey .   anyway ,  the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of o'toole's mistresses .   an incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring go-kart track .    ( presumeably all fashional french chateaus have a conveniently adjacent go-kart track )  .   this enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind .   after all ,  we have some top talent in allen ,  sellers and o'toole and we see them spontaneously go go-kart-riding off into the sunset  ( or the side of a building ,  or a mud puddle ,  or something meant to be funny )  .   i was glad to be done with the movie .woody allen is a great talent .   peter sellers was a great talent .   peter o'toole was a great talent .   watch them in their other productions but spare yourself the one movie that each one of them should not have made
the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens ,  very disapointtin
i rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school .   this video made its rounds in the public schools .   the songs are catchy and the film quality is good .but make no mistake ,  this is propaganda aimed at children .   i will not be showing it to my kids .despite the freewheeling title ,  the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys .case in point :   atalanta ,  a princess ,  finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world  ( on her father's horse )  .   she also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time .juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of  " ladies first .  "   the tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron .   the narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal .our  " hosts "  ,  infant puppets voiced by mel brooks and marlo thomas ,  are revolting .   there should be a law against using mel brooks' voice for a baby .   apparently ,  i repressed memories of these creatures ,  but seeing them again brought back the horror .   needless to say ,  i fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry .overall ,  this dvd is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children
as usual ,  michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours .  theres alot of great stuff here  ( the interview w marilyn manson ,  the interview w trey parker ,  &c )  ,  but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling ,  no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston .  i agree with many ,  nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution .
this movie was so stupid ,  everyone listens to nina when she is clearly messing with their lives .  they are stupid enough to believe her ,  and well i don't even know what else happens cause i saved myself and changed the channel
i have seen other pokemon movies ,  but this was the worst .  the plot was bad and it did not have that many pokemon as i thought . and mew does not fit in the story when it is about lucario
date movie should be shown non-stop to all captured al qaeda prisoners - only mass-murdering terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish .   let me be perfectly clear about this :  date movie may be the worst movie ever made ;  it's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of .   you may cry ,  you may scream ,  you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film ,  but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here - not once .   it doesn't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks .   the only thing i got out of this movie was an awful headache .   if you ask me ,  everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years - if not for life .   had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to date movie ,  he would have stayed in the ocean .whatever happened to that sweet and charming girl we came to know during the first couple of years of buffy the vampire slayer ?   why and how did it ever come to this :  alyson hannigan humiliating herself in such raunchy ,  tasteless ,  unoriginal drivel ?   she can still light up the screen with that smile of hers ,  and she certainly put a lot into her performance ,  but i'm embarrassed for her here .   she plays an overweight ,  very disgusting waitress from a mixed family  ( boy ,  is it mixed )  who is desperate to find her prince charming .   after convincing hitch  ( tony cox )  to help her find love ,  she's given a complete overhaul  ( literally )  ,  plunked down into a reality dating show ,  and actually finds a man .   we watch them go through the dating stage ,  the meet the in-laws stage ,  and the wedding stage ,  encountering a number of obstacles to their future happiness .   really ,  though ,  the story is unimportant ;  all the script cares about are stereotypes ,  clich�s ,  toilet humor ,  and things that make you go yuck .   there's no joke too hackneyed ,  no visual too disgusting ,  and no dialogue too stupid to throw in the mix .i'm generally a fan of dumb comedies and ridiculous spoofs ,  but this mess doesn't even qualify for the genre .   date movie is so utterly atrocious that you can't even laugh at it .   it's a complete and utter failure in every way possible

the book of acts is a book of power !   sadly ,  this is what is lacking in the dvd presentation .   the minute i began watching i knew it was going to be a weak  ( acting )  rendition of the story .   thankfully ,  it is word for word from the bible ,  which is why i gave it two stars .   reading through the book of acts one can almost feel the electricity of the holy spirit working in and through the lives of the apostles and believers .   all of that is lost in the dvd presentation .i would not recommend this dvd .   stick to the book instead
in essence ,  this is a texas chainsaw remake ,  but here's the difference ,  and why it's far inferior .  i don't care one iota for the  " victims .  "  i can barely tell the females apart .  the guys are so obnoxious ,  i look forward to them dying .  unlike texas chainsaw  ( parts one and two ,  horror masterpieces !  )  ,  this movie shows the  " psycho family "   ( hmmm .  .  .  kind of like texas chainsaw ?  )  far too much .  a little goes a long way ,  too much ?  overkill !  many plot holes ,  and take away the music ,  there was some really bad acting .  it gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style ,  and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed .  but in general ,  rob zombie should not get writing credit for this .  it's texas chainsaw massacre ,  only nowhere near as good
the gauntlet may rank as one of clint eastwood's worst movies .   it is so unrealistic and silly i frankly didn't want to even finish it .   released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and dirty harry movies ,  it stands out as being a real stinker .here eastwood plays a loser of a cop ,  ben shockley ,  who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in las vegas for a trial .   he's told it's a  " nothing witness for a nothing case "  so he thinks it'll be an easy assignment .   well ,  poor shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness .   it seems some conspiracy is afoot .   the rest of the movie is shockley ,  and his female witness ,  gus mally ,  running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes .   and plot is so ludicrously predictable it's pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is .unless you really ,  really like clint eastwood ,  this is one to forget .   i'll bet he wishes he could .
for a topic this edgy ,  this is an incredibly dull film .  the actors are good enough ,  mind you .  but they can only do so much ,  because the real problem with this film is the script .  for the first twenty minutes or so of screen time ,  the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother .   ( you *might* not pick up on that fact at first ,  since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film--certainly the two *look* nothing alike .  )  finally the main part of the plot begins ,  with natalie just as discontented ,  despite being married to a wealthy and quirky-but-ultimately-nice guy  ( alan rickman ,  for whose sake i watched this film at all--not worth it )  ,  and with her brother seemingly happy with his life ,  but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister .  from that point ,  things spiral--no ,  that's too dynamic a word to describe it--*mosey* out of control ,  with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair ,  the poor brother  ( the only particularly sympathetic character in the film )  becoming obsessed with the relationship ,  and the worried hubby's suspicions growing  ( although not in the right direction )  .  there's so much here that *could* have been fascinating and compelling ,  but isn't ,  on any level .  the plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi-believable situation ,  scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet .  this video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops--mercifully for the public--but i certainly wouldn't recommend resorting to buying it .
growing up ,  i absolutely loved the turtles but this dvd stinks .   the only plus is that i can have the original episodes in convenient dvd form rather than track down a bunch of old vhs tapes .   this dvd is no different from the season one and season three dvd's .   they all have spelling errors and title errors and each one seems to have been produce in a half-a$$ fashion just to capitalize on the new turtle's sucess .   which by the way the new turtles are much better than the old ones .   on the season three dvd the package refers to  " bebop "  as bebob ,  nice editing job .  i guess it was to hard to get that one right .   also all three of the dvd's are bare bones with no special features .   the price does however reflect the crappy job the studio did on this most of these dvd's can be purchased for around 10 bucks .   i just wish that peter laird had the rights to the old show so that it could have been done some justice on dvd
viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching , waiting , hoping !  !  !  , the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough ,  must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture . my advise is for you to save your money and buy comos  ( the best imo ) to be honest ,  i couldn't wait to sell it used at a $10 lose through amzn . the following week ( they get a commission for sold items ) nonetheless , i am content i no longer own it . next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn .  just so you know ,   " cosmos "  i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn .  . the late carl sagans " cosmos "  blows away  " the astronomer "
i love leslie nielsen ,  but this movie is not funny .  his better movies are wrongfully accused and the naked gun movies
this dvd is pretty bad .  i've seen the online trailer for the kino dvd release and the picture quality on the streaming quicktime movie was better then the picture quality on the  " triple feature "  dvd
sat down and saw this one on televion .only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money .what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement .  slanders the u-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders .  other than allied propoganda pieces ,  there are no incidents of u-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats .the movie itself i have little respect .  basicly plotless and  unrealistic .  action scenes unbelievable .  characters two dimensional .this film awful .
the award winning documentary freestyle ,  looks like something fresh ,  creative ,  and new from the exterior .  i was psyched to purchase this dvd the minute i heard about it .what a let down !first of all ,  how did freestyle achieve all of the acclaim and all of these film festival awards ,  secondly who picked it as a winner ?  probably some cornball who isn't familiar with the culture or good off the dome mcing ?this documentary tries really hard to connect to the audience and present the validity of rhyming off the dome but falls completely flat .  the film isn't balanced enough to a certain degree .  what you basically have is nothing more than a bunch of tree huggin backpackers spitting nothing but junk and 10 syllable words off the top of their heads for a majority of the film .  don't get me wrong there are some credible scenes in freestyle with mos def ,  biggie ,  black thought ,  j . u . i . c . e ,  and the last poets .  .  .  . but not enough .   freestyle tries to come off as some profound documentary but sheds very little light to the subject and the questions that many hip-hop heads have asked for years .  why wasn't the current trend of fake freestyles  ( writtens coming off as freestyles )  addressed more ?  why weren't more credible mc's exposed and quality underground mc's presented ?  why is there a section entitled  " written/freestyles "  ,  what kind of oxymoron is that ?  it makes no sense .  why is there a section on freestyle djing ?  ?  ?  what ?  ?  ?  !  !  !  ?  isn't that called turntabalism ?  ?  ?  it seems as if they're fishing for more topics that ultimately don't have much of a direct relation to rhyming off the top .  is there a freestyle graffiti section too ?  ?  ?freestlye continuously fails and derails itself off track from the key subject ,  the art of freestyling .  at times it tries to be a hip hop 101 dvd .  most of the people who will be purchasing the dvd are already familiar with hip hop's roots in the south bronx .  where is the quality freestyling at ?  ultimately ,   " freestyle "  is over-saturated with un-proven ,  extremely weak ,  amateur mc's who need to focus more on spitting quality off the dome freestyles .they cover supernatural's sorry a$$ for almost half of the entire dvd ,  which is very unfortunate .  i admire his creativity ,  but he sounds terrible .  it's no wonder why he can't get signed .  he thinks his doo-doo doesn't stink ,  because he's studied the dictionary to help expand his vocabulary for freestyling ,  but yet he can't take the time to concentrate on getting out of the broom closet that he lives in .i thought that this film could have benefited from more footage of proven vets who can truly freestyle such as kool keith ,  tribe ,  big daddy kane ,  krs-1 ,  snoop ,  kurrupt ,  common ,  safir ,  likwit crew ,  redman ,  or anyone from hieroglyphics .  these aforementioned artists can  " really "  freestyle .  that would have faired much better than watching these tofu eatin ,  incense burnin ,  soy milk drinkin ,  poetry night geeks struggle to put words together .  the eminem rap olympics footage from 1997 would have been great too .ultimately ,  if you are somewhat/vaguely familiar with hip-hop culture or a new fan of the underground scene ,  then you will love freestyle .if you consider your self a long-time fan of hip hop culture and familiar with the topic of freestyle rhyming then you will be somewhat disappointed ,  just like i was .if you want a quality hip hop dvd purchase check out  " the mc "  ,   " scratch "  or  " hip hop immortals "  take my word for it .  i'm rating this with 2 . 5 stars mainly for the rare footage of artists such as kool moe dee ,  bahamadia ,  biggie smalls ,   the roots ,  craig g ,  and kool herc
this dvd gives documentary coverage concerning such da vinci code topics as rosslyn chapel ,  the priory of scion ,  the knights templar ,  the gnostic gospels ,  le dossier secrets ,  da vinci paintings ,  and opus dei .this dvd ,  beyond the da vinci code seems to bend over backwards ,  measuring every narrated word ,  to try to support and be sympathetic towards the dan brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary ,  they still seem to be in favor of what dan brown has written in the da vinci code .out of a half dozen expert interviewees ,  the most notable are two  " big "  names who are major influences on the da vinci code book .  margaret starbird ,  author of the woman with the alabaster jar ;  and richard leigh ,  one of three authors of holy blood ,  holy grail ,   ( which was a ny times bestseller in 1982 )  ,  both appear throughout this program .these two are probably the biggest proponents of the jesus/magdalene conspiracy today ,  after dan brown himself .  so it is especially meaningful when richard leigh and margaret starbird disagree with what dan brown has written !according to expert interviewee richard leigh ,  though the da vinci code book says that the knights templar found documents to prove the jesus/magdalene conspiracy ,  in reality ,  nobody knows what ,  if anything ,  was found by the knights templar in solomon's temple .leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram ,  pentacles ,  5-pointed stars as mainly representing the  " sacred feminine "  is nonsense--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often !richard leigh also explains that the original priory of scion was last referenced in 1619 ,  but the modern day priory of scion people from the last 50 years are  " bonkers ,  "  trying to present a hoax of the le dossier secrets ,  to try to gain political influence for themselves .this le dossier secrets ,  which appears on the bogus  " fact "  page at the beginning of the da vinci code book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of jesus ,  but has been debunked for decades in france .  it does not belong on a page titled  " fact "  in the da vinci code book !  that is very misleading ,  not factual .  brown says the le dossier secrets were discovered ,  but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney !margaret starbird ,  another major influence on the dan brown novel ,  says that even though she believes in the jesus/magdalene bloodline ,  there is no proof of the bloodline lasting into the french merovingian line of kings ,  circa the first millenium a . d .the documentary ,  using other expert interviewees and location footage ,  goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the rose line alignments being found in significant locations throughout the da vinci code novel ;  as well as showing there is no evidence that leonardo da vinci was a member of the priory of scion ,  let alone the grandmaster ;  the rose is not the symbol for the priory of scion ;  and opus dei has no interest in the  " secret "  bloodline of jesus/magdalene because they don't believe it even exists .sadly ,  most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show ,  in brief statements ,  before quickly moving on to the next topic ;  while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what dan brown's da vinci code book claims about the jesus/magdalene conspiracy .overall i was disappointed by this history channel dvd for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain't so in the da vinci code book--though i am not surprised ,  the history channel usually sides against christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows ,  in my opinion .a much better da vinci code debunking dvd is breaking the da vinci code ,  which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel's lies about history and jesus
about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music .  the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who's not screwed-up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick ,  incestuous ,  and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in .  if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood ,  don't watch this
movie has a lot of cursing ,  and nudity as well .   i was very disappointed because i thought the reviews made it sound like i could show it to high school students
this film is a tough one to review .  the film itself is amazing .  so therefore ,  i should give it high marks .  the problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos ,  and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature  ( as if we came from outer space or something )  .  that is a bad and dangerous message ,  and so i feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that .amazing footage ,  but ultimately does nothing but further the sensationalism required to seek and destroy more animals and natural habitats .  how many grizzlies are hunted down and killed every year vs .  how many humans are killed by grizzlies every year ?  then take into account the fish we killed off because of dams ,  pollution ,  and over fishing that destroy the bears food source .how many grizzlies kill humans vs .  how many cars kill humans ?  shouldn't we all be more scared of cars ?i agree with the other reviewers that have said that this guy is cracked and self-serving .  we can co-exist with nature ,  but not in the way this nutjob tries to do it .  native americans  ( whom we also destroyed )  co-existed with them for thousands of years .  they respected the grizzly .  this guy no more respects the grizzly than does the cancerous civilization he condemns .treadwell was very conflicted and troubled .  not that we aren't all troubled ,  not that we all don't deal with failure and disappointment ,  not that a good rant doesn't make you feel better from time to time ,  but he had a death wish ,  and this was really just suicide by bear the way i saw it .  am i the only one that noticed he seemed very at odds with his sexuality ?  lastly ,  in some of the interviews ,  well ,  they were just weird and contrived ,  like they were acting .  these weird people in this film do nothing but harm the cause
a friend and i tried watching this film once again recently ,  but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant .   from the beginning ,  when katharine hepburn's character destroys other people's cars without a care ,  we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny .   the acting is fine ,  as could be expected from such greats as hepburn and cary grant .   but the characters are not sympathetic ,  fun or interesting .   grant's character is an unassertive ,  spineless person who is easily dominated .   hepburn's character is blindly selfish .  who could care what happens to them ?   the one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard .
i was really looking forward to movie .   my goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period .   many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing ,  these alone did not turn me off from watching .   my real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting .   within the first 10 minutes of the movie ,  a stage coach is robbed ,  my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors .   they were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers .   later ,  when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them ,  the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that i laughed .   as the movie plodded forward ,  scene after scene left me wondering ,  how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more .   i felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment .   i generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly ,  i think it was an embarrassment and waste of time .   maybe it got better  ( that is why i gave it two stars )  but i find that doubtful .   i am wondering if both tom berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of script writing 101 .
good grief - yet another dvd collection we are not buying because disney doesn't seem to understand .   we loved these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete .   i hope the folks at disney get the message eventually .   same thing applies to their live action feature films .   disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother .   too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production
i have seen many pathetic films in my life .  this topped them .  did i rate one star ?  sorry- i meant negative 11 stars .  it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .  it was a total waste of three hours when i could have been sleeping .  there was no point .  the script and storyline were pathetic .  the gore was overdone- too much blood ,  killing ,  and the like .  it was totally historically inaccurate ,  and the civil war scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable .  all civil war veterans are rolling over in their graves .  any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic .  one of the abolsute bombs was when clint eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time .  and somehow ,  without even aiming the canon ,  he knocks his 'friend' off his horse .the movie is a failure .  f-a-i-l-u-r-e .  crappy .  junky .  just plain dumb .  stupid .  pathetic .i am not going to waste any more words on it .  just .  .  .  . whatever you do .  .  .  . save your money .  don't buy it .  it's not worth 50 cents
so disappointing .  hardly a dark/noir film ,  in my opinion .  just a proper hollywood murder mystery .  and there's no sex ,  except brief kissing which lana always cuts short !   i'm a james m cain fan ,  and this doesn't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel .  everyone's too decent .  cora  ( lana )  doesn't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body ,  and she's always costumed like a perfect fashion model ,  fingernail polish and all .   frank  ( garfield ) is never lustful ,  never mean ,  never desperate .   always polite and decent .  not a gas station  ( except for one pump that looks planted )  not a single oil can or wrench .   not a greasy spoon or diner ,  twin oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or b&b ,  fit for donna reed & family .   the 80's nicholson/mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark .   much more faithful to cain
since i've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items ,  i'm not gonna repeat anything about each show  ( see individual reviews for that )  .   i will just rehash what i have all along .   despite its missing pieces from the book ,  the original is still 5 star material .   the  " in betweener "  is only worth it's value because it is a disc copy  ( as opposed to a tape copy )  .   my advice ,  buy the original separately ,  and read the book to get the  " real missing years "  .   if you are building a library of  " all richard chamberlain "  ,  then buy both or this combo .   but be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged  " missing years "  has to offer  ( again see separate review )
i ordered these ,  and several other movies from the tyler perry collection ,  only to find that they were not actual movies but on-stage plays .  i returned them and was charged a high restocking fee .  not ok !  no where in the description was mention of them being stage plays .  i will order my cd's and dvd's from another source in the future .
first of all ,  i am a joy division and new order fan ;  therefore ,  i tried to like this .   really ,  i did .sadly ,  this film stinks .   the focus is not on the bands themselves ,  but on the obnoxious character known as tony wilson .   what a monster !   either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life .maybe i'm not british ,  but i did not find 24 hour party people to be very funny .   only a few scenes made me grin .   the randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film .in addition ,  the camera work was very jerky .   looked like it was done by a novice  ( and yes ,  i'm one myself ,  having made two movies )the only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with joy division .   too bad the members of this band are minor characters .   i can only hope that the biopic of ian curtis currently in production will be much ,  much better
i made the mistake of watching it after seeing how many stars  ( 4 )  it received from other viewers .  the plot was butchered ,  the characters twisted ,  the story ruined ,  a pure agony .marilla is fat and ugly .  wasn't it supposed to be rachel lynde's character ?  matthew is sly and conniving and very outspoken .  what happened to endearing shy matthew ?  rachel lynde had been merged with mrs .  barry ,  dianna's mother ,  and hence mrs .  rachel barry  ( oh brother )  .  dianna is a petit blond and not a dimpled raven black haired damsel ,  who gets married behind the scenes without her bosom friend who was sent to queens at 18 as a punishment .  anne and gilbert are secret lovers brutally separated by marilla who is crossed with gilbert's father for stealing matthew's sweetheart many years ago .  get the picture ?this movie has no merits as related to the book .  it might have some as a stand-alone creation but i haven't found any .  i wasted nearly an hour and a half of my life and was bitterly disappointed ,  irritated and nauseated .  the creators of this movie were definitely not kindred spirits !  do yourself a favor ,  if you really like the anne books don't watch this movie .oh ,  and i do wish peter jackson  ( lord of the rings )  will fall in love with the books and make proper and accurate movies out of them .  do you hear me peter ?
unfortunately ,  i was sent a standard american copy of the movie which ,  of course ,  doesn't function on a european system ,  despite my adress beeing in switzerland .  so i was kind of disapointed to have a ) lost the money b ) not been able to watch the movie .  one is wrong to assume that every european household is having an american compatible dvd player .
how he gets away with it i will never understand . orson welles was a clown who dedicated his life to food and to criticize art in all of its forms .  ( that's what you do when you can't make art ) don't worry , there is always rossellini , fellini , renoir , bergman , dreyer .  .  .   .  .  .
this workout was very hard for me to get into ;  i became very bored by it .   the moves were challenging but the routine was blah .   if you are a beginner ,  this is not for you .   you are better off purchasing  " quick fix stability ball workout "  no matter what your level of fitness .
" four brothers "  is yet another nail in the coffin of john singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career .   the director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty  " boyz n the hood "  - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again .   the story ,  reeking of artificiality ,  features mark wahlberg ,  tyrese gibson ,  andre benjamin and garrett hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother .   when she is killed in a convenience store robbery ,  the quartet launches into action ,  seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced ,  through their investigation in the neighborhood ,  that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe .the main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters .   by not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother  ( except for one embarrassingly bad thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student )  ,  we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith ,  rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best .the acting is uniformly flat ,  with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes ,  and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the singleton pedigree in this area .   the boys' running around from venue to venue in their detroit neighborhood ,  brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer ,  is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque .with nary a single moment that rings believable or true ,   " four brothers "  is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more .
i am really wondering about the people who have reviewed this and gave it such good ratings . ive been looking at their other reviews trying to understand what it is they like .  because this movie stinks !im a huge reese witherspoon fan and i like paul rudd so i rented this movie and thought it would be good .  oh boy i was wrong .  the charachters are over the top and the story is just cheesy .  im all for a good fun ,  romantic comedy .  i like  " win a date with tad hamilton "  but this is just awful .reese plays a stripper  ( somehow it just doesnt work ) who helps the dorky hopeless rudd dump then win back his girlfriend .  all the time there is a package to stop hence the name  " overnight delivery "  .the story could have worked but it just doesnt .  the premise is good and there are parts that are somewhat ammusing but overall it sucks .i would reccomend this movie to anyone who liked the sarah michelle gellar movie  " simply irresistable "  .  if you happened to like that movie with the magical little crab .  if you disliked it as i did then stay away .
the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful
i go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this dvd to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if i didn't want to leave the house .   i was a little disappointed in this dvd .   i love self magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising .   the routines are broken down into four separate workouts .   the only one that involved any effort on my part was the pilates-inspired section .   as for the rest ,  the other sections would have you do too few reps ,  i felt ,  to get your muscles warmed up ,  let alone reshape them .   i think this dvd is great for beginners .   its simple enough to follow and it won't scare you away too soon .   but if you're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine ,  this probably isn't the abs workout for you
i remember taking a minute of my time to watch this dung when it premiered a couple years back ,  and lets just say i find watching something download more than this .  i swear i hate preps the most in this country .yesterday i was at the mall going to the  ( unspecified phone company )  lot to cancel my vonage service  ( vonage .  .  .  sucks .  .  .  a-s-s .  .  .  do not listen to what they say on tv !  i can't begin to describe how horrible vonage is !  )  ,  but to get there i had to venture through the worst part of the mall .  as i carried the phone bill ,  i crept past the k-swiss windows without a peep .  i then leaped from fake palm tree to fake palm tree infront of the abercrombie & fitch store ,  which was infested with teen girls and their sell-out boy friends that think wearing pink is  " hot "  .  i then slid down a railing and fell a couple feet short of the jamba juice stand .  i picked myself up with my remaining strength and threw the smoke bomb i had in my pocket infront me ,  thus disappearing from the mindless zombies drinking their elixir with the ever-horrendous down 4 life playing in the background .squash 'n' squeak below me speaks only the truth !  listen to him too !it may be hard for you 3-5 star reviewers to accept the fact but then again you can't handle it anyways .  come to your friggen senses and stop wasting you money on this garbage .  it's enough acting like you do already ,  but then you go and spend money on this litter to watch other people act like you do !  god damn
i am pretty easy to please when it comes to movies . low budget , high budget , doesn't matter . this movie is actually the worst movie i have ever seen in my 45 years of viewing . was totally not believable and the writing and directing was shabby at best . don't waste your hard earned bucks on this lemon !  !  !  !
i didn't think of it much as a movie as i did a porn frenzy .  i'm very much interested in history and also psychology and neither was apparent to me in this movie other than we know caligula was nuts .  otherwise ,  then i guess so was all of the roman empire .  i simply cannot believe one stroll down the streets would produce such frenzy .  it was stupid ,  simple and as soon as it was done i immediately threw it out .  not for the faint of heart .  not for the sophisticated either .  or anywhere in between .
where to start with this bad movie ?as if the plot matters  ( it doesn't )  ,  the movie is about a woman and her sister who use hubbie's computer to access chat rooms ,  etc ,  and witness online killings ,  and of course ,  see the killer in a sort of  " eyes of laura mars "  style .the two lead males are played by non-actor musicians roger daltrey and huey lewis .lead females are played by former actresses natassia kinsky and nicolette sheridan .the killer is played by a still-unknown actor .major problems :1 .  talking computers  (  " electronic chronometer activated "  )  .2 .  people talking to computers as they type .3 .  never making a typo even when typing at an awkward angle and not looking at the keys  ( while talking to someone else )  .4 .  easy access to talking encrypted computer by using a microphone that you have to be an inch away from to use .  and the computer selects only some of the words you say ,  as needed .5 .  really bad acting .6 .  un-sexy eroticism .7 .  over-technologized thoughout .it might seem tempting to  " save "  5 bucks ,  but you're wasting the other five dollars .
i purchased this dvd a while ago - fyi - a documentary of the anaconda was in the case and not the movie .   i went to the web site to complain and my profile could not be found .   here ,  years later ,  when i'm finally placing another through amazon they found my account and noted that i purchased meet john doe .   i guess it's a little late to complain now
they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was .   the journey is awesome !   then all of the sudden ,  the paid wwe guys just began to bad-mouth the warrior .  maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved ?   they take some very low blows .  they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler .  actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young ,  and i really can't distinguish one's ability from the other .  they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations .  vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test .  as soon as he says this ,  they fade to black then come back with a new issue .  what drug use ?  which drugs ?  presumably they're talking about steroids .  but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use .  let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the warrior .  they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior .  and they also just try to badmouth him so much .  who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him ?  i don't !  he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including hulk .  and oh yeah - they don't even let the warrior defend himself .   why did i have to find out from imdb . com that he was asked to appear but declined ?  why don't they address this ?   this  " docu "  is more slanted than  " fahrenheitt 911 "  every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it .  it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth ,  tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking .
as far as using the ipod as a recorder i think an actual digital recorder would get better sound .  the italk picks up  all ambient sound .  i have even used it with an external mic and still not wowed with the clarity
a $150 calculator that i am going to trash .   i had the same problem with the keyboard  ( terrible response )  ;  i struggled with it for about a year and then called hp .   my warranty was out ,  so hp suggested i install an update ,  which i did .   now the keys are firing off 3 or 4 digits with one press of the button .   this is ridiculous .
the radio works great .  .  .  . except  the last   2 sony walkman am/fm radios i have had  you were able to clip onto your waiste band when exercising .  .  .  .  . it was just a large clip thing .  .  .  . this new one has a different type that you have to use a belt with !    and who  uses a belt to work out  ?   i certainly dont .  .  .  .  . so i am using a very large safety pin   thru the hole in the back and then i pin it onto my shorts .  .  .  . which has made a nice hole in the material of  two pairs .   otherwise it is a great item
i bought these batteries on what was writen on their packaging .  it was not true to what was said .  these batteries died after only 25 minutes in my digital camera .  and a set of duracell ultras ,  that are not rechargeable ,  lasted longer .  do not always believe what you read .  make sure you have the ability to return items .  and is with this case ,  they went back .  i went with a set of energizers .  and they last much longer ,  with the power being the smae as these 1800mah monster brand
does not work at all dont throw away your money should read 0 star
i am comparing these transfers to the hp transfers for colored shirts .   these require a reverse image and are just not user friendly .   after three unsuccessful attempts i just went back to the more expensive hp's .   the transfers did not adhere well and would flake off in little chunks even before you tried to wash them
speaking from real experience ,  don't waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price .  i bought a few top of the line monster cables once i got the top of the line sony xbr960 hdtv .  later on i switched cables around ,  with other brand ,  cheaper component cables such as philips pts1000  ( the hdmi standard owner by the way )  ,  and also other hdmi cables  ( even no name brands coming with my dvd player )  .  you know what ?  i see absolutely no difference even under close examination .  the sony xbr960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any tv .  you think about what that means .  stop buying this ridiculously priced cables ,  and save your $$ and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list .  digital is digital .  don't let monster mislead you that their cables produce more 11010  .  .  .  than others .
this amazon listing also suggests buying the soundsticks along with airport express .if you're thinking of connecting them to the usb port of express ,  apple says it won't work .( apple airport express faqs
i think this product design concept is great .   i love the flexibe arm size .   it fits great in my car .   the crappy part .   i live near metro st .  louis and i could not hold a signal anywhere !   i always had some intereference .   whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out .   this product did not meet my expectations ,  especially since the back of the package states i should have crystal clear sound .   this is not true .   i have returned this product after little success over the first week of purchase .   i am now waiting to get my dlo transpod 2 in the mail to try it out .   i want something to work !
when i first started using this ,  i loved it .   it worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound .   in fact ,  i bought a second one for my wife .   then ,  after about two weeks ,  it stopped working .   it would no longer play in my cassette deck ,  which ejected it as soon as i put it in every time .   i tried contacting coby's support on the web ,  but they were unresponsive .   luckily ,  amazon took it back for a refund .   note that they no longer sell these directly .   bet they had too many returns .  .
while i don't have any evidence to refute the package claim that it  " attaches to any notebook "  ,   once attached to my son's computer it was almost impossible to remove .   it took 10 minutes to get it off and we were pulling so hard i thought we would damage the computer .    we will be returning it .   not recommended
please !  for the love of god !  do not buy this product !  it is absolutly horrible .  i'll admit that since i bought my computer and go this card back in 2002 ,  i hadn't had problems until the past few months .  i play an online game - a mmorpg - and after every time the game is updated and i have to install the updates i am unable to log onto the game !  it freezes up ,  and either makes my computer crash or destroys my internet connections ,  forcing me to restart .  as you can imagine ,  this gets rather frustrating ,  and if you play mmorpgs ,  you can see how it is even more frustrating .  i am currently running xp home edition .  i beg you ,  do not buy this ethernet card just because it is the cheapest one out there !  you get what you pay for !  now i'm off to buy a new one
i bought this item like 2 months ago ,  and now it's broken .  i'm sooo frustrated .i 'd not recommend buying this item
the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years .  it lights up just fine ,  and it is a reassuring led gold ,  but it refuses to do anything with my xd card .  it worked just fine for 3-4 days ,  then erased about 100 photos ,  all of them irreplaceable .  cheap yes ,  but cheap junk .
this phone is a total piece of garbage .  freezing ,  rebooting ,  not beingable to connect to hot spots ,  not logging you out of skype if you arelogged on at your computer at the same time .  horrible tech support .  cani add any more negative feedback ?  oh yeah the rediculous ring tones andspeaker quality .  thanks for nothing netgear and for making me wait 6months on pre order for a real piece of plastic junk
product is light duty ,   over time it will not hold up to being flipped and opened often ,   if longevity is your goal purchase elsewher
my very first cell phone was motorola ,  and it served me great ,  so i became attached to the brand based on that experience  , and for that reason alone bought  motorola sd4591 digital corded/cordless system .   as we've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks .  the battery life got very short very soon too .  i was told i need to get different batteries nih instead of nicd .  naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too .  as we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5 . 8hz 2 line phone i decided to get motorola md7091 5 . 8ghz digital 2-line phone and remained loyal to motorola .  and boy was i wrong again .  what others are saying about caller id not showing as soon as i have another phone on the same line besides motorola md 7091 is true in my case too .  i don't get it does motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones ?  ?  ?  this is really cheap tricknaturally ,  i could blame all this on poor quality of nicd batteries ,  wireless network ,  microwaves and phone company ,  and other brands' phones connected to my line .  but what is the common thread through the entire ordeal :  motorola .  i will give other brands a try now ,  not yet sure which ones
the bel rx65 worked great ,  for about 1 month .   after that ,  it started flashing  " selfcal "  and  " service requiered "  on the screen .   sent it in to bel for them to fix the problem .   after about 10 days i got the product back ,  only to have it repeat exactly the same problems again within 2 days of having it .   i feel like i've been ripped off ,  because they either didn't even look at it or they don't know how to test something for a problem .   i spent $300 for a detector that doesn't work as well as a $40 one  ( and i know ,  i've had both )  !i would say i recommend escort ,  but i've since learned that they are owned by the same company as bel .   valentine 1 is too costly ,  so i guess that doesn't really leave many good detectors on the market
i have a 5gb but a lot of the h10's are having the same problem .   i can play all of the songs that i owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled .  i've done a little research about the disappearing mp3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the h10's and 1 other model i can't remember right now and iriver can't figure it out ;  although i've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug .  .  .  . so buy with caution .  .  .  .
after having my old phone for 40 years i bought a new nwb phone due to remodeling .  it lasted 5 months .  you cannot get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mail .  buy a nwb phone at your own risk .  i had to buy another phone--at&amp ; t and it works fine
i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years .  i purchased three for my mac and pc at home .  then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit .  currently only one still works !  i have very infrequent power outages ,  perhaps three in the past four years .  these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down .  my g5 mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd .   i can't comment on other ups brands such as belkin ,   but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores .  there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand .  my experience over the past four years has been mixed .  these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes .  if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear .  i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms .  many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance .  the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years .  i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years ;  three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries .  prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor .  battery life depends on many factors so i don't begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable .  i bought apc branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures .  i'm frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model .  just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups
the unit works fine as a bluetooth radio .the software and drivers !  !  !  !  do not install properly at all !  !  !i am a network administrator & pretty savvy about pcs - i could not come up with any scenario to get the software to work !  !  !save your money and just buy the unit - forget the software
i just received my pair today ,  and i have to say ,  i'm extremely dissapointed .  yes ,  they are comfortable ,  but the bass is almost absent ,  no matter how far you jam them into your ears ,  the bass isn't nearly what it were hyped to be ,  it definently isn't enough for the amount of mid & hi's they produce .  unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max ,  i'd recommend another pair of earphones .  if you're just looking for comfort and you don't like hardly any bass ,  these are your headphones .  but ,  as others said ,  you can find much better earphones for a much lower price
this thing works well until a bulb blows out .  when i replace the bulb ,  it will not turn off after 4 minutes and i end up having to replace it
before you buy anything from creative ,  google the words incompatible + legacy drivers + sounblaster + windows xphuge compatibiltiy issues that will have creative tech help telling you to flash and update your system bios ,  chipsets ,  leaving an entire pci slot between sounblaster card and any other card ,  update drivers ,  yada ,  yada ,  etc .  read all of the issues from the aforementioned google ,  and ignore the creative employee reviews  ( they are easy to spot )  .  creative ignores the fact that its products have huge conflicts with windows operating systems
mine worked fine for about a month before it stopped working .  dealing with d-link isn't a pleasure either .don't get it .  get something better .  spend a little more ,  avoid the hassles
my company car has a built-in gps unit and i have gotten to like it ,  sort-of .   i have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around silicon valley enough to get a portable gps unit .   after some research ,  the garmin ique 3600 is what i ended up with and i paid about $700 .   the unique feature of this portable gps unit is that a palmpilot comes integrated into the package .    i use a palmpilot ,  so this gps unit replaces my palmv .     installation was quite awkward ,  and getting it up and running was a chore .    i got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now .   it does do the job ,  fitfully ,  and has several glaring issues .   most irritating ,  the palm function and the gps function are not seamlessly integrated .   if an address is entered in the palm part and then route to this address is selected ,  the ique 3600 makes you find the location .   but the address from the palm section doesn't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address .   i'm left-handed and graffiti has never worked for me all my letters are drawn backward .   the gps can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go ,  but my unit takes a good 5-10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky .    this means that i must have a good idea what to do for the first 5-10 minutes .   sometimes i just drive randomly until the gps locks in and starts to issue navigation orders .   also ,  the antenna must be deployed to get any gps reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky .   this is ok ,  except that the ique 3600 doesn't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed .the ique 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard .   if the antenna is not deployed ,  the ique 3600 simply doesn't navigate and doesn't tell you why .   worse ,  it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode .   if i ever figure out what that means ,  ill tell you in a future post .   i figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of ottawa .   i'm a fan of gui design ,  and i must say that the ui here is very ,  very bad .   not the worse i have ever seen ,  but very bad :   non-intuitive ,  inconsistent ,  and arbitrary .   the find function/button has an entirely different function in the gps section from the palm section .   of course ,  the same icon is used .   i cannot imagine grandma using this thing to navigate .   what little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious .   about 10 times more information is needed here .   it shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose  ( battery savings maybe ?  )  .the secure digital card is too small  ( max of 256mb )  ,  so you can't put more than a few california counties in the memory .   maps storage is managed with a rather hostile gui .   this is not fatal ,  but is irritating .   i would rather put a 1gb sd card in the ique 3600 and be done with it .the ique 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable ,  so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle .   i don't find the power issue to be a problem .   i understand that to get clear ,  bright screens it is necessary to use power .   i agree with the tradeoff here .
i really wanted to like the tomtom navigator 5 .the gps itself is tiny ,  well-designed ,  and very sensitive .   it worked fine from down in a underdash cupholder or in the glove compartment .the interface is attractive and easy to navigate .   the voice prompts are clear and loud .the installation on a mac was problematic .   search on tomtom osx for details ,  but suffice it to say that the installer included on the cds simply doesn't work and a new one must be downloaded .   once past that ,  it ran fine on my treo 700p .unfortunately there is one fatal flaw - the map database .   in using the navigator in both california and north carolina ,  the maps regularly had misnamed streets ,  exits referred to by numbers where there were none ,  and directions that lacked critical information like heading  ( i . e .  take the 101 instead of take 101n when approaching a complex interchange )  .worse ,  the company seems to be actively hostile to updating these maps .   if you go to the tomtom site ,  you can purchase maps on a city-by-city basis .   are they newer than the ones that came with your unit ?   who knows ?   tomtom lists no version info and seems to expect you to buy and cross your fingers .there were just too many errors that i saw while traveling in areas that i'm familiar with to trust the tomtom maps for any unfamiliar territory .   everything else is great ,  but the whole point of a gps is accurate navigation .   and sadly ,  that's where the tomtom navigator fails
these disks would not work with my sony brand dvd writer .  i have tried several other brands and so far everything works but memorex .
i would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months .   there is a reason the warranty is only 90 days .   the performance  ( sound quality )  steadily declines over time .   the ihome worked great when it was new ,  but it won't play songs from the ipod anymore ,  and the radio is a static box
when realtime traffic monitoring came to my city ,  i immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife's daily business driving  ( 2-500 miles weekly ,  crisscrossing a 50-mile area through major traffic routes )  .  i quickly settled on an automotive gps with realtime traffic monitoring .  there are not yet many choices in this area ,  so the options boiled down to this unit and the garmin 2720 .   ( these use fm radio for the traffic info ;  the xm-radio units like the tomtom 700 and garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since i don't want xm radio .  )i chose the cobra for its large screen and positive reviews in areas that were important to me .  its flawed routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be used in a well-known region .  address lookup and traffic monitoring were the primary needs .in short ,  i don't know much about how the cobra performs because i was only able to use it for a few short test trips .  this is because the mounting hardware is one of the most deficient pieces of engineering i have ever encountered in higher-end electronics gear :- the only mounting option is via suction cup ,  which in tests would adhere reliably only to nearly flat glass .  a stick-on disc for attaching the suction cup is also provided ,  but i did not attempt to use it and would not trust it to be able to hold this heavy  ( 1 . 25 pound )  unit over the long run .  if your vehicle does not have a flat section of windshield in a convenient location ,  you will have very few options for mounting this unit .- california law prohibits attaching things to the windshield ,  meaning that california users either need to risk a minor ticket or find an acceptable alternate mounting point .   ( good luck to you :  i was unable to find one in three different vehicles !  )  compounding the problem is that the mount has a very limited positioning range and easily runs out of adjustment room for most potential mounting alternatives .- cobra does not offer any other mounts or mounting accessories at all - no beanbag or friction mount ,  no clamp ,  no fixed-base mount ,  nothing .  if there is any aftermarket option  ( ram mount ,  etc .  )  i was unable to find it .  you are stuck with cobra's proprietary mount unless you are willing to modify the unit or its mounting pieces and fabricate an adapter for a garmin or ram mount base .i was *almost* willing to go the extra mile to make this unit work in my vehicle ,  even though the best solution would have been very awkward to dismount and remount ,  making it a potential theft target .the final straw was when i found that the traffic receiver was faulty and i was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a timely manner  ( two days now and counting .  .  .  )  enough's enough ;  something was telling me that this unit wasn't the right choice .so this unit is being returned and i've already ordered a garmin 2720 with gtm11 traffic receiver in replacement .  the prices for the units through amazon are nearly the same  ( especially when factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the cobra comes with three months and gets $60 per year after that ,  while the garmin comes with 15 months and has the same annual cost after that - so you have to add $60 to the cobra to get a truly equivalent price )  .  garmin also has excellent mounts with a range of attachment options ,  some of the best map and routing tools ,  and a long track record with gps units .  it does have a smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface ,  but at least i can mount it properly and be able to tuck it away and remount it easily to prevent theft .this unit gets two stars only because my brief experience with its function appears to live up to all the positive reviews - but overall ,  it's like a high-performance sports car with no wheels !  i 100% recommend against it for california users and suggest that others try to lay hands on a sample unit to see if it can be properly mounted in your vehicle before laying out $750
i live in a particularly bad spot for tv reception and have been forced to use cable .  this antenna brings in several local stations but the quality of the picture is unsatisfactory .  so ,  unfortunately ,  for me it's either back to cable or try an amplified outside antenna .miles kenned
bought a cell phone battery that ,  of course ,  died one week past their return/refund deadline .  refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective .  this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again .  consider yourself warned
takes 3 aaa batteries that in our experience run out too quick .  other units we've owned have lower battery drain .  also the lcd display has poor contrast .  all in all ,  i'd buy another one that costs a few bucks more
i cannot recommend hp to anybody anymore .  the company introduced regional coding ,  which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another .  for most this is probably not an issue ,  for those busily traveling around it is .  also ,  it is an issue of principle ,  its bad enough for dvd ,  but printer cartridges ?  hp has introduced this rather secretely and if you don't read the box cover etc very carefully ,  you may not notice .  the main issue is in europe .  i got caught out .  i bought a 3 catridges overseas - i could not use them on my hp printer .  i asked for a refund ,  hp email support  ( us )  was nice but ineffective .  hp customer support  ( europe )  was snotty and very rude .  i think hp does not care about its customers and this cost me over us$75 ,  almost 50% of my printer  ( my sixth and last hp )  .  don't buy hp
as far as i can tell this thing doesn't work at all .   i have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them .   i should have just replaced the cds
does not live up to expectations .   sound is tinny .   hard to find stations ,  very narrow band of reception .  .  . plan to purchase a grundig
after two months ,  this phone stopped working .  it was returned to panasonic repair and we received a notice thirty days later saying that the phone was back ordered and delivery would be in 6-8 weeks .   this is not customer service .  panasonic should have refunded the purchase price or offered a comparable or better phone .  when called today to check on status of order ,  answer was basically  " tough luck .  "  never again ,  panasonic .  amazon should discontinue this brand
the case looks nice ,  but not practical .  everytime you need to change the volume or track you have to pull your ipod out .   my ipod had scratch marks on it the first week .   unfortunately ,  all the picture you see of this case is from the side view ,  so you cannot see that there is no opening for the wheel and the display .   i recommend iskin product .
phone seemed nice but i bought it to hang on a wall and it wouldn't due to manufacturing .
i am disappointed in this product .i was suppose to write to you from the weekend .my two rear speakers just stop working ,  and also myremote control .  i have replace the batteries ,  but stilldoes not work .i don't have any other rear speakers to try on the system .pleasy me what to do .thank youepiphane flaviu
i was hoping that by getting this i'd get a decent flow of air and i'd be able to use it anywayer .  but i was sorely dissappointed .  it doesn't give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel .  .  .  plus its too loud to use in most places .  .  .if you really need it ,  you can get it .  .  .  but i can't use mine often because like i said its too loud .  not worth it ,  not enough air flowing
camera will not stay up on wireless network with dlink router !  firmware has some serious issues .  dlink support was worthless .  i returned the camera and bought a panasonic and never looked back
these sound awful .  i'm embarrassed to admit i spent 140 . 00 on these .  the earphones from my 1989 sony walkman are far superior .  if you like your music to sound as if it came from the bottom of a well then these are for you .
i had bought this item due to good review before i went to a trip to bulgaria .  however ,  it plugs in but doesn't work .  why ?  i don't know .  how should i deal with it now ?   is it a defect one ?  i have no idea ,  to me i just lost 17 dollars for an experience .   ( don't buy electronic items from a book store ,  even it's cheaper )  fortunate i also bought targus travel adaptor set that save me
after only a couple of months of light use ,  the sub woofer started making loud thumping sounds and the system stoped working .   as soon as power is connected to the sub woofer ,  the loud thumping starts .   i exchanged the system and the second set had the same problem after 6 weeks !  !   a total piece of junk
we purchased this printer to replace old brother hl-1440 for our small business printing needs .  at first everything was great .  after 4 months of use ,  still on first toner cartridge ,  the manual feed can no longer grab labels or envelopes .  there is now a huge gap and the envelopes can slide all the way inside with no resistance .  huge problem for us and i hope we can return this piece of junk
bad disc error - possible fixafter about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working .i kept getting bad disc error on a new dvd i bought .  i tried good discs that worked before but now got the same bad disc error .this is not the first time i had problems loading .  previously ,  unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem .this time after two weeks of bad disc errors ,  i was about to toss it when i decided what the heck ,  i'll check inside to see if it's dirty or something .first i unplugged the unit .i removed the 6 screws holding the cover .  you may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off .with my expertise knowledge .  *eyeroll* i nudged the lense mechanism .  it apparently slides to read the discs .i plugged the dvd in and loaded a disc again to see what happens .  the lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc .  i'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day !  lolso hopefully this will last a little longer .  but at least i can use it again for now  .  .  .i am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error .  the viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers
the ge superadio iii used to be a great radio .    i bought my first one seven years ago and it worked so well that i bought another .   i have recently purchased two more as gifts and they are not the same radio .   side-by-side they look the same  ( except for the numbers on the tuning dial )  .   inside they have dissimilar circuit boards .   the real difference is the two new radios are unable to tune stations nearly as well as the older radios .   i would recommend not purchasing this radio
don't buy these things  !   they go bad and sandisk won't replace them .   buy ocz or a-data or something .  these things are very unreliable .  .
this charger is flimsy .  1 )  as other mention ,  the  " retractable "  unit quickly became tangled ,  and without significant attention every single time  ( not feasible while driving )  ,  doesn't retract .  2 )  the plastic covering the wire at the base of the jack pulled loose ,  exposing the wires .  3 )  after a few months of very gentle use ,  the white plastic cover of the jack cracked and fell off .  as a result ,  i'm back in the market for a charger ,  just months after buying this one
the item i bought had to be returned due to the fact it did not wor
i am shocked by the amount of positive reviews on this site .   let me tell you about my experience .   i bought this machine in june of 2005 .   in one year ,  i have replaced this machine three times .   all three times ,  i got error messages that the toner cartridge was out  ( toner life end )  even when new toner cartridges were put in .   i do give high marks to brother for its customer service ,  though .   each time i had a problem ,  i called and they sent out a replacement by fedex along with materials for me to send back the broken one .   but when the fourth replacement arrived last week and i turned it on and got an immediate paper jam message ,  i had enough .   i had a similar issue with a brother mutlifunction machine i purchased around the same time .   i am done with brother products
well ,  so far so bad .  .  .  i burned the dvds on my panasonic dvd recorder .  they play in my newer dvd players ,  but i cannot make a copy of them with sonic dvd ,  nero ,  or one click dvd .  unacceptable !  i have used many types of dvds ,  never had this happen .  i guess i know why some dvds i have purchased are playable ,  but not copiable .  .  it is the media !  i will stick with maxell , or tdk
i have been a dvr user through cox cable for approx .  1 yr ,  and have always been disappointed .   i have kept my eye on tivo for some time ,  and when my dvr box went out for the 2nd time ,  i decided it was time to try tivo .   i got a refurbished series2 dvr that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $12 . 95 per month .i received the tivo only 2 days after i ordered ,  very impressive since i didn't pay to have it shipped that quickly .   the setup was reasonably straight forward .   i had heard so much about tivo that i had very high expectations ,  and here are the problems i encountered that surprised me :1 )   my first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs  ( dvr does this automatically )  .   so i ordered the wrong unit .   to be honest ,  i don't see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner ,  my family relies on dual tuners a lot .   i am shocked that tivo even offers a single tuner system ,  to me it's like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed ,  a dual tuner is so much more useful .2 )   i thought i would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network .   no ,  you have to buy theirs for $40 to $50 .   since i didn't know that ,  i had to rely on the phone line option .   this really stinks ,  it is very very very slow .   i spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming ,  the system kept getting interuppted during download  ( yes i disabled call waiting )  .3 )   when you use the online program guide ,  it covers up the entire screen .   my cox dvr puts the tv in upper right corner  ( approx .  1/4 )  asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide .   we use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on ,  but that won't work so well with tivo .   plus ,  scrolling up and down is painfully slow ,  the screen takes for ever to refresh .4 )   similarly to item 3 above ,  when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely ,  you can only see the tivo guide .   again ,  cox dvr lets me look at my list and delete files etc .  .  all while my tv program stays visible in the upper right corner .5 )   remote wouldn't work with my 42 "  akai plasma .   i can't fault tivo too much on this one ,  none of the universal remotes seem to work with this tv for some reason .i did love some of the tivo features and wish my cox dvr had them :1 )   wishlist2 )   tivo suggestions3 )   can access your tivo through internet4 )   view photo's through tivo .in the end my items # 3 and 4 were things i just couldn't get past ,  so i returned my tivo .   they were friendly and helpful and i really wanted to like this product ,  but in my opinion it's not able to compete with the speed and power of the cable companies dvr .
i purchased this to have a stereo for my ipod for primary use in my office ,  but to take with me other places .   i have the 30 gig video ipod - it fits loosly .   the entire system seems cheaply made .   as i mentioned ,  i wanted to use it in my office - well ,  at the lowest volume control ,  it is not very quite ,  so i would annoy my co-workers if i turned it on .   bottom line - save your money !  !
we have been unsuccessful with this e-reader attachment since we purchased it .  cards read once and never again .  doesn't matter if we use the gb sp or advance .  still doesn't do anything .  don't recommend you waste your money
the good news is that this is a full featured gps solution that is easy to mount in the car and can navigate to contacts in your address book .  maps are detailed and the poi  ( point of interest )  database is fairly extensive .the bad news is that it all too often fails to connect via bluetooth .  installation of software and maps is error prone  ( do not follow any of the 'advanced' hints in the manual - they scrambled my sd card )  .only buy this product if you like puzzle solving and have a great deal of patience .  if you are expecting an out of the box solution that is 100% reliable - look elsewhere .
great dvd/vcr combo but does not play dvd's from other region .  does not have an eject button on the remote either .  if u have dvd's ,  vcd from other countries that you would be playing i do not recommed this player
for over eight years  ( nearly 9 )  ,  i had an acer 17 "  crt & loved it .  i use a kvm to switch computers ,  & the crt kept all of my adjustments for that computer ,  every time .when it started showing signs of age  ( about four months ago )  ,  i decided to try a flat screen ,  or lcd ,  though i've heard horror stories about them ,  my laptop is great .i don't mind the dark overlay associated w/lcds ,  i have that on my laptop .  i was amazed at how poorly this monitor responds to things .  i still swap computers .  i can't get the same clarity that i once did .i swap between me & xp ,  which shouldn't matter .don't believe there isn't any flicker ,  that's wrong .  if you change the refresh rate ,  the monitor changes ,  not the computer .  what happened to dumb monitors  ( what happened to dumb printers )  ?  best ,  should be a button  ( turn on )  away .  some tweaking isn't bad .fade out :  i have the monitor ,  at the  " proper "  height ,  & the upper & lower corners fade .  as looking at any lcd from an angle .you can't tilt this monitor very much at alldon't spend much time on shut down or re-start in me ,  the lines & jaggies will kill you .i'm sorry that i bought this monitor .  the refesh rate for games ,  is fair .  don't play any games prior to me !  because me era games fade badly at the ends ,  nearly blacking out .  post xp isn't anything to write home about really .i would suggest trying out an hdtv first .  with a direct  ( vga )  plug in .  it's a few dollars more ,  but if you're considering an hdtv ,  as well as a monitor ,  i'd chance it .  you can always buy a 20 "  crt for less .i hope this helps
thinks my street is 50 feet before it actually is ,  therefore recalculates before the turn .if i go a different route ,  it continually tries to get me to make a  " u "  turn .instead of shortest or fastest route ,  it may pick one that is very roundabout  ( you should see how it wants me to drive home from work )  .maps need to be updated more often .   street atlas or streets and maps do a better job of being updated .  .  . i'd use them except i don't want to tie up a pc just to drive across town .it might work well for cross country ,  for me ,  it's an expensive toy that i have yet to develop trust in .
i loved my little seagate 5 . 0gb drive ,  even after the first one crashed and burned .  but the second time ,  i cannot forgive .  i carried it everywhere in my pocket ,  and maybe that was part of the problem ,  but if it can't handle that then it is no good to me .  solid state memory ,  here i come
this item worked for a while ,  but required fiddling  ( unplugging and replugging repeatedly )  with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car .   eventually ,  however ,  it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets .   don't waste your money on this piece of crap
don't waste your money .  what iriver doesn't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead ,  the system is useless .  i will never buy one of their products again and i'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products .  my system cost me $ [  .  .  .  ]  and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive
my shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so i took it into the apple store .  a salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything ,  and said i would have to sign up for a appointment at the  " genius "  bar .  at that appointment ,  the  " genius "  said he couldn't fix it ,  and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both .  apparently being an apple  " genius "  doesn't involve understanding how things work ,  though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut .  the 'genius "  then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing .perhaps it should be retitled the  " idiot bar .
the keyboard with this set is flimsy and cheap feeling .worse ,  the layout is nonstandard :  they've messed up the key cluster above the arrows  ( insert/delete/home/end/etc .  )  .   and the right hand ctrl is not below the right end of the shift key ,  it is under the left end of the shift key ,  where one of the windows keys  ( the context menu one )  normally is .   they've taken out one of the windows menu keys ,  too .the wireless features worked fine  ( i've used it two days )  and worked even without installing their driver software  ( something i'm always reluctant to do )  .   i think some of the extra buttons  ( multimedia controls )  on the keyboard don't work for me ,  because of this .   i use the computer it's on for work ,  not screwing around ,  so this doesn't bother me .    ( i have it installed on a thinkpad laptop so i can keep the screen farther from my eyes ,  and my employer bought the thing ;  it wouldn't have been my first choice .  )i've given it two stars only because it worked great ,  out of the box ,  with no driver software .    ( this is on a thinkpad running winxp .  )   i'm already dreading the battery usage  ( based on another review here )  .   thankfully ,  it's not my main keyboard
cheap piece of junk .  probably has 2 cents of electronic parts in it .  i'm returning it to wallmart .  it might work ok if you live like right next door to the broadcast transmitter .  otherwise it's just too weak in its signal pulling ability .  also ,  when i turn the gain dials ,  they don't seem like they are really variable .  i think they are really just on/off switches disguised as variable dials ,  because i don't see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels .  i'm going to now go to a real ,  serious electronics store and look for some serious tv electronics hardware instead of wallmart garbage .  i'm going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and i'm going to try using a variable gain preamp if i can find one  ( a high quality one ,  not junk )  .  i tried a preamp from wallmart  ( which wasn't adjustable at all )  and it did help a lot with uhf channels ,  but the vhf channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong .  so i need a variable gain preamp ,  assuming there is such a thing .  i would advise everyone to go read the information available on the internet about tv antennas and how to get the best picture with them .  i did yesterday and there's a lot of good stuff i never knew before .
this seemed like a great card at a great price .  unfortunately after 4 months ,  during the middle of a paid shoot ,  all of the images instantly dissappeared .  i stopped using the card ,  put it aside until i got home .  i tried to use software to recover the images .  only a few could be recovered ,  the rest were gone .  i've not been able to re-format the card in either a canon eos 5d ,  digital rebel ,  or using software on my computer .  the card is now completely un-usable .all of my older cards continue to work just fine .  hopefully this is just a lemon ,  although i need to replace it ,  and am obviously apprehensive about purchasing another one from sandisk
we drink a lot of coffee all day ,  every day .   so we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and fresher-tasting .   we first bought the 10-cup capresso mt-500 which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly .   the coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great .   unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it .   so instead of another expensive capresso replacement ,  we decided to try a japanese model which we thought might be more reliable .   we have been using the zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly .   no leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the capresso .   unfortunately ,  there is no water filter system in this model compared to others  ( we had taken this for granted and not checked for it )  .   and no reuseable metal mesh filter  ( that i could find on the market )  instead of paper filters .   the water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds .   we are not sure why our coffee just doesn't taste very good anymore ,  but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality .   today ,  we pulled out our very old krups proaroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement .   we will use this and the zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new capresso coffeemaker replacement .   don't waste your money on this zojirushi model unless you don't care about taste .   it was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned .   even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine
don't listen to any of us . you already have an internet connection because you are here .  go to a browser and ask the question you asked here .  you will find that any review that is not a store will tell you that all speaker wire is the same .  they just look cool .  if that's what you need ,  then buy it .  otherwise ,  stay away from monster .  it's just like bose speakers .buzz word ,  that's all .  these companies can't make any money selling you a 10 dollar cable .
i have a g4 tower mac that did have a built in ethernet .   unfortunately ,  a lightening strike took out the port and i was forced to get a pci card to replace the port .   the first card i bought was the d-link dfe-530tx+ .   i was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with macs and that the  " minimum requirement "  was os 10 . 2 .they lied .   os 10 . 2 is the _maximum_ for this card .   for most people ,  it won't work with 10 . 3 and up .   d-link has no driver for 10 . 3 or higher ,  only 10 . 2 .   a google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with 10 . 3 .   i couldn't .   i tried several different drivers  ( some users recommended a driver from realtek )  and none worked .it's my guess  ( and totally a guess )  that this card is really only for older macs that are limited to 10 . 2 .   d-link doesn't seem to have any intention of supporting modern macs .this is the second d-link product i've used  ( the first was a cable modem )  and i've been disappointed both times .   i can't speak for windows users ,  but this company doesn't deserve mac business .
it worked okay for about a month and then froze up one day when i was running .   i popped out the battery so it would turn off and when i turned it back on it had deleted all of the songs .
about three years ago ,  maybe four ,  i bought two lexar cfii cards .  one never worked ,  the other worked ,  but lost all data .  i wrote to lexar ,  that i had two bad cards ,  they sent me one new card of the same size .  i gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing .  i still have my card ,  in a ziplock .  none of the file removal programs will get the images off ,  & i've used all of them ,  & had their  ( file removal )  tech help give up .in this day & age of  " just make the item "  i am upset .  but you take your chances .  do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a lexar ?  i wouldn't ,  i use an actual sandisk card ,  myself .if they ever  ( lexar )  made it right ,  i may have written a better review ,  but they haven't .  so that tells me that they don't care .how important are your pictures to you ?frederic
to back up my personal dvd collection i burned 200 discs .   100 on these memorex dvd+r's ,  100 on philips dvd+r's .   every memorex had flaws during playback .   every philips was flawless .   i've been buying memorex for years but i'll never buy memorex again
i installed the board and my pc  ( running xp pro )  won't boot .  i tested all the pci slots with other cards  ( and mixed them up too )  and the pc boots fine .  i returned the card and got a new one .  same problem .  i removed all of my other pci cards and left this one in there alone  .  .  .  same problem .  i'm speechless .  i guess it's not compatable with some systems .  by the way ,  i know my set-up is fine .  i have 3 pci slots filled and 3 additional usb devices and all is well .  i never had a problem like this before
first off ,  i bought this headset for gaming ,  which anyone who enjoys the pastime will tell you how quickly the hours can melt away .  gamers are dependant on an ultra comfortable pair of headphones that we shouldn't be able to feel .  i have been searching high and low for the holy grail of comfort and i was certain paying $90+ for a  " gaming "  headset would be the end of my search .  sorry ,  these guys are going back .i've tried a couple  " cheap "  best-buy headsets that i found painful to wear after an hour or so .  then i decided to spring for  " top of the line "  .  i wore these for 15 minutes before it became obvious this headset was not the holy grail i've been looking for .the headset itself feels flimsy and cheap .  the padding is made of an itchy fabric ,  and even on my small head ,  it feels tight .  the earphones do not cover my ears and i can feel them slowly being crushed .  i'm not impressed with the sound ,  but i could overlook that if they were comfortable to wear .  i didn't even bother to try the mic .if this is how sennheiser makes their high end gaming equipment ,  i think it's safe to say i will avoid these guys in the future .  the $30 pair of aiwa's i wear at work are more comfortable than this and sound the same .  .  .  if only that pair had a mic .*my ears still feel uncomfortable after taking the set off and then writing this review- i couldn't imagine wearing them for a few hours while gaming .  if i find the perfect pair i'll let you all know
i too bought one and had the headphone jack become loose .   i bought another thinking i had a faulty one ,  but now i'm having the same issue with this one .   the loose jack causes the reception to go in and out .  .  . and finally just out completely .   i agreed with the previous opinions on this fatal flaw
i am still awaiting resolution of a problem i have with these drives .  in writing dvds i get verification errors .  this proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure .  the drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the ide bus ,  but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire
i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd ,  the sound from my system did seem to be a little better  ( the cd's were not skipping as much )  .   but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably ,  although not as bad as before .    .  .  .  not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk cd changer
i just purchased this printer last night at bestbuy and took it home .  when i removed the contents of the box ,  i noticed that the usb cord was not in there .  i read the directions and said that you had to buy the cord separately .  i couldn't believe it .  so ,  i went to the store and bought one .  this cost me an additional $11 .  i went home ,  installed the software and plugged everything in .  i printed off a few things and it looked great .  today ,  i went to use the printer again and the power woudn't turn on !  i disconnected then reconnected everything and still no power !  i tried several more things and still couldn't turn the power on .  now i have to return it to bestbuy .  this was the first and last time i will ever buy anything from hp !  !
this player is a piece of junk .first the usb really doesnt mean you can hot swap .  you can access the files only if the software is installed on the computer which means that you cannot pick up mp3 from any computer .second ,  it gives errors with xp .  it tries  to install drivers every time .third ,  removing old and adding new mp3 is such a hassle .  it takes minutes to delete old files and add new .  seems like you are working with a floppy .fourth ,  its mojo software hangs all the time .fifth ,  it sucks battery life .sixth ,  if your mp3 is not in a directory ,  i . e .  if copied directly ,  it wont show .  then it wont delete and will show 200 mb as not free space .  formatting is the only way out .seventh ,  it came with a mail in rebate which never showed up .overall ,  a bad experience
while i read the reviews on this machine ,  it is clear to me that lexar has some serious quality-control problems .  for some people it worked ,  for others it was a miserable failure .  i am in the latter group .  sigh .mine was dead on arrival .  i tried the device with *both* of my windows-xp machines and in both cases ,  it was unrecognized .  lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help
this flash drive does not work with windows 98se .  the back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for windows 98se at the maufacturer's web site .  first i tried downloading the driver .  turns out the driver is a  . zip file so i had to download winzip so i could unzip the driver .  after downloading the driver and winzip the flash drive is still not recognized by my pc .  the faq at the manufacturer's web site states if the device is not recognized the bios on my pc must be enabled .  but the faq doesn't tell you how to enable the bios
the battery life for this phone after one short year is abysmal .   after charging it all night ,  it dies after a few hours of nonuse .the redial button simply has never worked .it is not user friendly at all although i could live with this if the two issues above were resolved .i contacted at&t and requested that they send me a new model that works since this phone is obviously defective .if they refuse then i won't ever buy an at&t product again and neither will anyone i come into contact with .it's that simple .update .  .  . at&t refused to do anything about the phone despite the obvious flaws ,  .   as a result ,  i will never buy another at&t product again .at&t ,  you are exhibiting the traits of a company that will go out of business .
when this adapter first arrived ,  i thought it was great .  the sound quality was excellent ,  and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm transmitter-style adapter  ( there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area )  .  the first day ,  i used it for about 20 minutes total  ( didn't have far to drive )  ,  and it worked great .  the second day i had a bit farther to drive .  after about 30 minutes ,  it quit .  hasn't worked again since .i didn't expect it to last forever ,  but less than an hour ?yes ,  it has a 1 year warranty :  just send the unit back with a money order  ( $6 )  to cover the return postage .  of course ,  then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit .  .
amazon quickly shipped this item to me and i was ready to rock 'n' roll -- until i plugged it in .   there was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear .   the buzzing noise stopped when i hit mute ,  so the plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem .   amazon was very gracious about their return policy and i was quickly sent a new phone free of charge .   well ,  the second phone does the same thing and i'm returning it to get a refund .   maybe just my phone line ?   possibly .   but i've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both
i have had the 325 model for less than a year .   up until recently i was satisfied with its performance using it to print less than 5 pictures at a time .   recently ,  i needed to print a series of pictures  ( more than 10 in one sitting )  and had an error message-print cartridge jam-i fixed the paper jam but continued to get the error message .  i  called hp and they stated this was a fatal error in the unit and encouraged me to purchase the updated model rather than fix my printer .   i searched the internet for a solution only to find that others had encountered this and the solution was to purchase the  " new'model- a not very cost effective solution as this was not supposted to be a disposable model .
for some years i tried this and other monster products ,  to the tune of over $1000 in monster a/v gear .  the more you learn about video and audio ,  the more you'll avoid anything with the monster label .  specifically ,  this s-video meets no ntsc ,  dvd or ieee standard ;  it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed ,  low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding .  has a sharp image ,  but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching ,  dirty grays ,  burned highlights ,  murky shadows ,  noisy reds ,  and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds .  makes video test patterns look great ,  but who watches test patterns all day ?  amazon offers many other brands at good prices ,  why waste your $$ on this stuff ?  i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar ,  belden ,  viewsonics and others from amazon .  result :  vast improvement in every respect .
i purchased this wireless card based on the price ,  figuring that even if it didn't live up to the good reviews here ,  i would only be out ~$20 .   the set up was easy and smooth ,  but the card won't stay connected to my wireless network .   i've got a belkin wireless router .   the trendnet signal meter generally shows ~95% signal strength ,  but the connection only lasts for a few minutes ,  and i have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access--very annoying .   i know there's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop's connection is stable .   i purchased a d-link card ,  and it has worked flawlessly .   unfortunately ,  i threw away the packaging when the trendnet card arrived ;  if i hadn't ,  then this card would be on its way back to amazon now .   like the title of my review says :  you get what you pay for  .   .   .
i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups ,  and the last 5 or so failed .  i thought it was my software ,  so i got new software .  guess what ?  my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed ,  too .   it's not my burner  ( as another reviewer suggested ,  implying that people should learn to read )  ,  as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention .  they just suck and have a high failure rate .   so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best .  i'm buying some now and save myself the frustration
i got 0~1 bars on my wifi detector and hoped that this would help .   but it didn't get any better .   you'll have to get some decent signal beforehand in order to get this antenna to make things better for you ,  i suppose .
i bought this rikaline gps 6010 a month ago .  i tried to make it work for hundreds times ,  but it only worked once .  evertime when i turned on the gps ,  it was always telling me it was initializing and then it just stopped working . i hate this thing because it embarrassed me before my friends .
this isn't the type of behavior i would expect from such a valuable and big company as amazon is .  they cancelled my order same way as the other people's .  they didn't even send any notification email and i found my order cancelled by looking at the site .  amazon must learn that this is illegal and they must ship all the orders placed ,  if they made a mistake pricing the item is their problem not ours and more after many customers confirmed the price over telephone .  if amazon don't ship the orders already placed they will throw stones over their own roof and make lots of bad publicity .  i'm one of many who won't be buying anything ever if amazon don't send me my ordered items .  count with me for any legal actions that may be taken
i bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my mp3 player through my radio .  i like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station ,  but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit ,  which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations .  i didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product ,  looking back ,  i should have .  i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there aren't many stations that you can listen to on the radi

i've had my hp5510 for 4 weeks .  so far everything works to my expectations except--when i press the scan button an error comes up on the led :  unable to scan documents from printer to pc .  no scan options .  you need to install or run hp software forfeature .  press ok to continue .  "  my system is 4 weeks old .  i had a local reputable company put my system together .  we uninstalled and installed hp software several times .  went to hp website-could not find a patch .  couldn't repair error .  my last resort is to call hp which i haven't yet .
i bought this in april for my new canon 30d and it worked great until several months ago .  when i would go back to scroll through the recently taken pictures on my camera it would start saying  " data corrupted "  .   it started out slowly then it would lose every third picture .   i tried to reformat the card and got an error message .   now my camera does not recognize it nor does the camera software on my computer .   it was a wonderful card while it lasted but i too am hesitate to get another one .   hopefully mine was a lemon too .  .  .  .  . but then again
even the slightest bump cause the casette to pop out and stop the cd .  i will be returning this to amazon for a refund
i have a 5gb but a lot of the h10's are having the same problem .   i can play all of the songs that i owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled .  i've done a little research about the disappearing mp3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the h10's and 1 other model i can't remember right now and iriver can't figure it out ;  although i've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug .  .  .  . so buy with caution .  .  .  .
i got this print server about a month back .  initially it took me 4 hours to get this thing installed and running in the wireless mode !  after i got it setup ,  it worked fine for a week .  but ,  then the wireless connection with the print server got flaky ,  so i switched to the wired mode .  all was well again ,  but then after a couple of weeks the wired connection got flaky .  it stopped printing and didn't recognize my hp-1200 .  after fiddling around with it for a few hours i finally got the contraption working again .but ,  now my latest problem is that the print server prints garbage to the printer !  plugging the printer directly in to a computer works fine ,  but the print service somehow corrupts the data going to the printer and i end up with pages of garbage and error messages .summary :this thing was a beast to set-up and every time something goes wrong ,  it takes a phenomenal amount of time to debug and correct .  that's in addition to the questionable reliability of this device .  i say steer clear of this thing .  i'm now shopping for something better and never buying d-link again
here is the original review of this machine i wrote on june 17 ,  2006 :we bought this machine just over a year ago  ( a year and two weeks ,  to be specific )  .   we had another very similar panasonic dvd recorder  ( dmr-e55 )  in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch dvd-rams on both .   for a long time ,  the es10s recorder worked fine .   recently ,  though ,  it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down ,  and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks ,  ejecting them ,  and even playing them .   at first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the dvd-rams so many times .   but today we tested one of them in the other machine ,  which has never made any similar noises ,  and the e55 had no problems with it .   needless to say ,  we're not happy that the es10s seems to be dying ,  especially since the 1-year warranty just ended .   if you buy or own this machine ,  follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period ,  because the noises and problems just get worse .   panasonic is usually a reliable brand ,  one we've used for many years ,  but this machine seems to be a lemon .   we're actually going to write to panasonic about it--i'll try to post again with the results .here is my update ,  which i wrote november 3 :this is a follow-up review to the one above ,  which i wrote on june 17 .  i wrote to panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended .  they sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair ,  including labor ,  of the machine at one of three places they listed .  the places were all within a half-hour drive of my home .  after doing some research ,  i chose one and brought in the machine .  they fixed it by replacing  " the entire internal mechanism "   ( i don't know what that means )  .  we got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of july ;  it's now the beginning of november .  the fixed machine worked fine for a while ,  but in the past few weeks ,  we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before .  i'm going to try writing to panasonic again and asking for a refund ,  because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it .  it's still working ,  but i know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't .  avoid this machine .  again ,  the previous panasonic model  ( dmr-e55 )  we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great .  we're still big panasonic fans ,  but this particular model is a lemon .
i didn't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning .   the cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned  ( 30 minutes )   it didn't
with a full charge it does not last more than 10min ,  could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera canon pro1 .  the original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge .  initially i thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all .  i'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too
i can't say enough positive about logitech mice .   this device ,  however ,  was a dismal disappointment .   the pc interface works well ,  and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive .   unfortunately ,  that in no way translates into a good remote interface .   the ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor ,  and ,  for those with video recorder boxes ,  very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available  ( if its there at all ,  its hidden many keystrokes deeper than i care to know about )  .   even when reverting to manual operation of individual components ,  changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes  ( as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes--a much more irritating trait than one might think )  .   overall ,  for day-to-day functionality i actually consider the barely-programmable remote that came with my scientific atlanta dvr vastly superior to the harmony ,  which i've given up on after only a few days of forced use .considering the ridiculous pricetag ,  i strongly advise you save yourself a lot of money and your relatives a lot of frustration this year by steering clear of this sad study in user interface failure
i have the same problem some other reviewers had :  the audio was extremely low unless i manually adjust the cassette .   it's not that easy - you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there ,  and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts .   but that doesn't always work .   if that doesn't work ,  you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit .   i'd rather not have an accident on the highway by either  ( 1 )  fiddling with the audio ,  or  ( 2 )  smashing the adapter into little pieces while i drive .hundreds of songs on the ipod and no way to listen while you drive .  .  .
i purchased this unit not for gaming ,  but for making pc to pc calls .   here are my observations :pros :1 .  sound quality of the microphone on the receiving end is reported by my friends and family as exceptionally clear .   certainly much better than what you'd get out of a webcam .2 .  chord is robust and long .   easily fits over my long desk to my cpu that rests beneath .3 .  controls are easy to use ,  although the mic on/off switch doesn't click into place like i'd expect it to .   it just slides back and forth .   i can see people accidentally turning it off .4 .  headphones produce good sound ,  although nothing extraordinary .5 .  the mic itself freely rotates ,  so you can position it however you desire .cons :1 .  first and foremost ,  if you've got a small head do not purchase this !  !   my head is not big and these headphones are not adjustable !   these headphones are so large that they're actually uncomfortable .   their entire weight rests on my ears and i can't wear them for very long without my ears falling off .2 .   these headphones are very heavy ,  uncomfortably so .   i've resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears .3 .   perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler ,  but it still feels like i'm wearing a set of insulated ear muffs .   chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until i'm dying of heat exhaustion .4 .  you need to get a y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time .  if you don't have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue .   otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again .   y splitters are only a few dollars but it's an accessory you will have to purchase ,  especially since front speaker ports on most computers can't be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack  ( and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one )  .  granted ,  this is more of a general microphone/headset combo issue than anything logitek related ,  but if this is your first microphone/headset purchase then you should be aware of this problem .   i use onboard audio instead of a sound card ,  so i don't have multiple output jacks .5 .  these headphones are designed to rest behind your neck ,  not over the top of your head .   unfortunately ,  the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back ,  placing all the weight on your ears .   the plastic beam is also too short  ( and just !  )  to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit .6 .  the design also doesn't make sense .   the beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck ,  yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head .   it's pretty uncomfortable .   if the headset was adjustable it would be fine !   the earpieces are just too huge !overall i'm disappointed with these .   if you're under 5'10 "  i say go with another model .   the hardware works great ,  but the design is terrible .   i'm returning these and purchasing an uglier ,  but more functional ,  set of smaller headphones
what a waste of money .  for $300 you shouldn't have to buy a protection plan for the 2nd year of a products life ;  unfortunately the poor quality of ipods makes it a necessity .  but ,  the protection plan is riddled with clauses that exclude any number of reasonable issues .i've bought apple for the last 15 years ,  but never again will i send them my money
in each pack there have been several dvd's that aren't any good .   too many bad discs in my opinio
the picture shows the cassette feature along with the car kit .   the cassette did not come with the kit .   very disappointed
ok .  .  . it functions well as a clock radio .   just fine .   reliable .    but that's not too much to expect .   yes ,  it will charge your ipod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually  ( though not gradual enough )  gets louder .   the adaptor for my nano fit fine ;  and i didn't find the clock too bright  ( it has 3 settings )  .   but the sound is really terrible .   it sounds like its coming from a transistor radio .as well ,  it advertises that you will be able to go to sleep and wake up with your ipod .   but as we know ,  you don't need a clock radio to do that--your ipod will do that on its own if you set it .i took this back after 5 days and hooked up some cheap computer speakers with a volume control .   they really sound better--i swear .
using rechargeable aaa batteries ,  with the battery saver feature turned on ,  about two hours .  sometimes i get more using alkalines ,  but not much more .  honestly ,  this unit is worthless ,  because i can't trust the batteries .order a garmin etrex legend instead .  it isn't much more expensive ,  larger or heavier ,  and it includes a base map of roads ,  towns ,  and shorelines .  the legend comes with a cable to transfer data from your computer .  the legend's screen is a bit larger ,  but shows much more detail .  and - the batteries last hours and hours .
i purchased this and am not impressed .   note that  " works with all click wheel ipods "  isn't true .   it does not work with photo ipods  ( at least the 60 gb model )  .  i'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit .   i'm ordering a 'photo dock' since i can't see any way to get a cover that is made for the 60gb/photo model .if i'd known this ,  i'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately ,  since i already have a charger  ( came with it .  .  .  )  .   grr .    : -
i don't like how easy it get scratch ,  and if u get the black one even worst ,  i went shopping for cases but they get scratch inside the cases too ,  just by been in the case ,  i return the case ,  then i when for those clear stickers and i recomend to put those on on a really clean table and very dry and clean hands may be use glove cause a little touch and there goes your finger print in the sticker ,  and with a black ipod you can't miss it .  and if u don't take your time u will have a lot of air bubbles showing in your ipod ,  so after a week looks like something that i have for a year ,  it sucks .
the first unit couldn't even find fm stereo stations .  it had similar fm specs as the sony st_jx410 am/fm tuner it was replacing .   it was returned as a faulty unit .  the replacement strde 197 was able to find stereo fm stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo .  my 25 year old jx410 tuner did an excellent job on fm stereo stations .  the second unit was returned for a refund .  sony's quality isn't what it use to be .  i bought an onkyo tx-sr304 .  the fm works fine with more features & expandability .
i ordered this radio back in may and i still don't have them .   it is now september .   i have exchanged several emails with amazon ,  the first one i received a very nice but untrue reply .   the second response was borderline rude but at least honest ,  they told me that they don't have the product and don't know when they will .   if you are looking for something to use now ,  don't waste your time with ordering this radio

with a destructive toddler in the house i like to back up my dvd movies .having recently purchased a 25 unit spindle ,  i recently tried backing up several dvds with my sony dru-710a 16x dvd recorder .   although the recording process initially did seem to work smoothly ,   when i attemped to play back the disks recorded at 16x speed ,  i would have read errors and lockups on dvd players usually towards the end of the film  ( the outside of the physical disk ,  where maximum recording speed is obtained .  )i did have better reliability recording at 4x speed and suspect that 8x writes will work fine as well .   given the fact that i paid a premium for this new high speed media ,  i am disappointed .   i have had nearly 100% reliability with memorex 8x dvd+r ,  recently making 25 successful recordings in a row with this brand  ( asin :  b0001mku4s
i had reservations when buying - according to online reviews many of these devices seem to be defective  ( the belkin as well )  .   i purchased anyway and my fears were confirmed .   leds do not light ,  does not transmit on any frequency .   manufacturer representative  ( from india )  confirmed that it is defective .   return will be time consuming and frustrating ,  but $50 is enough to make me endure even more pain .   don't buy this item
it failed dragon naturally speaking's sound tests ,  tests easily passed by the cheapo mike included with the program .   and just try to return it .   antonline stonewalls ,  plantronics doesn't respond at all
do not buy this item ,  it is very liable to break within the first week of purchase .  and i bought 2 of them ,  so statistically it's not jsut me .  the first time the door broke ,  and without the door there's no way to hold the ethernet cable to the connection .  the second time ,  the usb part broke off and got stuck in my computer and i could not put it back together .  all in all ,  not the best product out there .  try instead the belkin usb to ethernet adaptor
great sound ,  but the build quality is just not there .   on a recent trip to europe ,  the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver .   they are only two months old and i always keep them in the case !   i had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together .   since then i've also had to superglue the right bud as well .   also ,  the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead ,  revealing the fine speaker wire underneath .   i don't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad .   they are great sounding and comfortable ,  but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners .   be warned
i bought 2 pairs of this radios and 1 of the pairs have a damage radio ,  the microphone dosen't work and i cant fix it !  !   :  (im sand about it !  !  !
when it works ,  this mouse is simply wonderful .  small ,  accurate ,  easy to recharge ,  easy to carry .  under those conditions ,  it's probably my favorite mouse .  i've found that it's equally good for both mac and windows .one complaint is that when it's tethered to the usb port for recharging ,  it works nominally ,  but becomes very slow and awkward .  it's not at all the same behavior as seen when it's completely free to move .my first incarnation of mouse lived a long life of about 10 months .  my second incarnation of mouse ,  however ,  just died at the tender age of 4 months .  i've attempted mouse-to-mouse resuscitation ,  but to no avail ,  having found that iogear technical support exists by name only .  i have sent multiple requests for help ,  and have received not a single answer .  both mice died identical deaths .  suddenly it stops being able to hold a charge ,  and freezes after about 5 minutes of use .  even when tethered to the usb port for a recharge it freezes .i'm sad that a technologically good product should have such terrible quality assurance in its manufacture .  and such terrible customer support in dealing with its lack of qa
i'd really like to know how i listen to the radio at night and have it shut off in an hour and then have the alarm go off when i need it .  i thought that's what a radio was supposed to do
not a particularly easy lock to use  ( combo part rotates freely when not in computer ,  making it difficult to set the combo )  .  also changing combo is very easy to do accidently .  however this is usually not a problem because it is incredibly easy to figure out the combo .  i am not a professional lock picker ,  and i am able to break the combo without any difficulty  ( which is a problem with many low quality combo locks ,  but this design try to avoid it at all )  .i've noticed a lot of people have a problem with the lock  " spontaneously "  changing combinations .  it's probably not because the lock  is defective .  it's probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage .i would definitely never suggest this product to anyone  ( unless i really wanted their computer )
despite the slick marketing effort  ( i . e .   " with srx "  )  ,  this product falls short .the installation disk is useless .customer support was good ,  when i could get through - which was not very often .i constantly lost the wireless connection .i constantly had to re-boot .despite significant effort  ( utilizing the online help features )  i could never obtain a secure ,  encrypted connection .no more linksys for me !
i like the features .   i'm satisfied with the sound .   the user interface could be more intuitive .however ,  my overriding complaint is that the docking port  ( as many other reviewers have mentioned )  is not reliable .   the connection is poorly constructed ,  so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the ipod isn't there any more .   if they could fix this quality problem ,  it would be well worth the $100 ,  but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can't justify it at any price
during the installation of the software on my pc running windows 2000 server ,  the installation program froze my pc completely .  i had to turn off the pc ,  and now it does nothing when i turn it on .  the lights on the front light up ,  but nothing happens at all .  i called netgear ,  waited on hold for 15 minutes ,  and then was connected to a gentleman whose english was not very good .  i explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it .  he told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with win 2000 server .  i told him that i had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 pro ,  but not 2000 server  ( perhaps there are some )  ,  but he insisted that this was the case .  i explained that ,  typically ,  installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user ,  and exit ,  rather than freezing and disabling the computer ,  but he held firm ,  and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help ,  and that he recommended that i contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration .i went around and around with this fellow ,  then finally asked for his supervisor .  after another 15 minutes on hold ,  another guy came on the line ,  who was pretty fluent in english .  he explained his understanding of the situation ,  which was still wrong ,  and i explained the whole thing again to him .  he had me turn the computer on and off ,  which of course i had already done several times ,  and check the monitor connection .  after this analysis ,  he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it ,  and must be some other problem with my pc that had previously been working perfectly ,  that ,  coincidently ,  occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze .  i expressed skepticism towards this explanation ,  and asked him if he would believe that if it was his pc .  he said that absolutely he would ,  and reassured me that there was no possible way ,   ( emphasis his )  that his software could have caused these symptoms .since i understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone ,  i suggested that i could take it to a local technician ,  and send netgear the bill for repairing my system .  he declined that offer .so ,  at the end of the day ,  i'm left with a dead pc ,  but ,  according to netgear ,  a perfectly good wireless card and installation cd .no more netgear for me ,  thank you !
worked well when it was working .  .  . massive bass response ,  comfortable cushioning for big ears and funky styling .  only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction .  however ,  none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase .  gave absolutely no signs before hand ,  just working one day ,  completely dead the next .  there are other reviewers here that shared my same fate ,  so if you want to gamble with these ,  go ahead ,  but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones .
i have had two of these units .   i would definitely not recommend anyone buying the ml-300 .   save yourself some money and get something else .   both of the units lasted only 14 months .   i did hardly any typing with them .  only multi-page forms and applications .   the printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys .   took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing .   contacted brother international usa and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months .   save yourself some money and buy a big chief table and a number 2 pencil .
i like the color and sony's technology of the earphone itself .but the hanger that should be placed on your ear is worthless .when i put the earphone in the ears ,  the hanger part is just hanging in the air ,  not supporting the earphone to be placed in and steady .because of that ,  the earphones easily pop out of your ear
i got avaya roadwarrior up and running on my computer to use when i work remotely .  my co-worker told me to get a gn netcom headset but i figured i'd save some money and get this one .  big mistake .there is a major problem with some laptops when the power cord is plugged in ,  the listener on the other end has what sounds like you in a an airplane during flight .  the humming goes away when you unplug the power cord but that doesn't help me ,  i need to be able to use it when the power cord is plugged in or not .anyway ,  i chatted with plantronics support and then informed me that it's a known issue with no work around except to unplug the power cord while using it .so ,  it's getting returned .
i got these batteries just over a few months ago for my portable gps unit that i use often on my travels .  in fact ,  i bought eight of them  ( two packs of 4 )  .  i was upgrading from my previous set of 1600mah rayovac nimh aa batteries that were still going strong after 2 years .  when i saw the new energizer 2500mah rechargeables i was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old 1600mah rayovacs .   boy was i wrong !for 2-3 months ,  the 2500mah energizers worked well .  a charge lasted about 6-7 hours in my portable gps unit .  i was getting roughly 5 . 5-6 hours on my old 1600mah rayovac aa's .  my gps unit is spec'ed for 6 hours on a pair of aa's so the new 2500mah energizers seemed to work flawlessly .now they work okay and seem to be getting worse each time i charge them ,  appearing to hold less of a charge each time .   for the last month or two  ( 4th & 5th month after their initial purchase )  i'll be lucky if i can get 4-5 hours of use out of them in my portable gps unit .  i now get roughly 3 . 5-4 hours of use out of them .   i pulled out and tried my old 1600mah rayovac aa's and once again got approximately 5 . 5-6 hours of use out of them in my gps unit - and my trusty rayovacs are just over 2 years old !i thought i might have had some defective energizers but i can't seem to get any pair of combinations to hold a decent charge .  charges just don't seem to last - it's really disappointing .   i am going to look at another brand for high capacity 2500+ mah nimh batteries to replace my 1600mah rayovacs .  would be great if the energizer could hold its charge .  but because they don't ,  i do not recommend the energizers to anyone
wiring broke at interface box - poor design
i am on my second one and i will be returning this one also .  both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that .  i was so mad i almost threw it against the wall .  i thought the first one was a defect ,  but then when i got the second one i realized it was a design flaw .  .  .  if you buy the targus one keep your receipt because i guarantee you will be returning it .  what i don't get is how targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it :  satisfaction guaranteed .  what a joke .  .
i own a sony dsc-s40 .  i had lost my sony memory stick so i thought i'd try this one .  i purchased it the end of june and almost every time i take a video and try to veiw it ,  it will play and at any point durring a video it will stop and say file error .  this also causes a problem while i download them onto my pc .  only once had it done this on a picture and i ended up having to delete the picture because it wouldn't download .  sometimes it just don't pay to save money .  i will never purchase this kind of memory stick again .
i was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews ,  however ,  i have been extremely disappointed in them .   i may have had too high of expectations ,  but these things put out no bass whatsoever  ( it just sounds muffled and cruddy )  ,  and the overall sound is extremely poor .   i'm really surprised as i've owned jbl speakers in my car that i was extremely pleased with ,  so i'm amazed at the lacking quality in these .   i would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included
i bought this router and spent almost two hours online with linksys .  after trying every sort of suggestion and speaking with three different tech support people who barely spoke english i finally understood that linksys has  " limited support for macs .  "  when i asked what  " limited support "  means ,  i was told  " we are not trained to help people with a mac .  if you can borrow a windows pc we can help you "  .  what a waste of time .  i am sending the router back .  beware if you have a mac
while certain labels with this software are much more easier to work with such as the cds and the general labels ,  i found this product much less than satisfactory .the inserts and the software don't align too well and are a few centimeters off .  .  . especially on the lower half of the page .   if one wants to keep the insert regardless of whether or not the  " cut offs "  are present it would be best if the paper was inserted within the opposite position in the paper tray in the printer so one can cut to the size needed .otherwise ,  i would suggest what another amazon customer has done .  use cardstock paper .  .  .  . at least for the back inserts .   and trim with either a scissors or paper cutter .a product should do what it promises it will do .   unfortunately ,  this one does not .   at least ,  within my experiance this does not measure up to what was previewed within the memorex beginner's package w/ cd label stamper .two stars for at least being able to print the front side .   although it would have been nice if they had said so without stating they could do both when they cannot
bought these and used them once .   had to remove them when i found myself in dire need of some excedrin migraine .   what do you get for your $39 ?   cheap ,  tinny ,  bass-less sound that's like being plugged into a busted walkman .   the buds themselves don't remain stable in the ear ,  so forget about using them while engaging in motion-involved activity  ( such as jogging ,  walking ,  head-bobbing ,  neck movement ,  etc )  .   these are by far the worst earbuds on the market .   how could apple stoop so low ?   don't be fooled !   do a google search for these and you'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product .   you've been warned .i used to use koss earbuds ,  which were pretty good .   i sold these ipod duds in favor of the xtrememac in-ear headphones ,  which are the best ones available and worth the extra money
do not waste your money on this product !  !  whilst amazon has a very good price for it ,  the headset is junk !  i tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum .  the hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines .  it could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible .  i work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes .  this set is very poor quality and not worth the money .
what do they say about fools and money ?hdmi uses tmds which is a digital transmission system with built-in error correction .  tmds has been designed to work over cheap cabling and a $10 hdmi cable will meet the specification .  if you spend 9 times more on this cable than another one then you have just wasted $80 .  that's all there is to it .you don't need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable .  the picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a $90 cable over a $10 .  in fact the signal is identical .  let me repeat - hdmi  ( & dvi-d )  devices talk digitally with error correction .  this cable and ones like it are for suckers only .
i bought these because i have an hp printer and figured they would be best for the shirts i want to make .   i couldn't get them to take for anything in the world .   i put the pressure on it ,  ironed them longer ,  everything you can think of and they still wouldn't take .   then when i finally got one to take it completely cracked and crumbled and started peeling off before an hour was up .  it never made it to the wash ,  so now i am out the money i paid for them and still have no shirts .   any other brands you suggest instead
the transmitter doesn't work .  i tried everything i could think of to try and make it work but it doesnt
i have owned the tomtom navigator 5 for almost a year now .   while the program is well thought out and provides a good function ,  it does not work well with my tungsten t5 .   i have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues  ( listed below )  ,  but to no avail .some of the issues i have had :any time the software has to redirect or think ,  it locks up .   if i stay on the original planned route ,  it sometimes works properly .  .  .in a 30 minute trip from orange county to long beach ,  i had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up .voices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device .in a 20 minute trip from san francisco to oakland the device locked up 5 times .   i finally gave up and called a friend to guide me .bear in mind ,  i have had no problems with my t5 in the 1 . 5 years of ownership .  .  . it is only with this software .   customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing .in summary ,  it's not worth spending the money to have to print out mapquest directions to have when the device crashes .  .  . stick with mapquest

i had this for approximately 2 years .  it worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances .  one day i left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour .  during this period ,  the alarm was activated and i was embarrased to face my office workers .  this is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm .  i sent it back to targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm .  but after several months ,  it started the same problem .so ,  now i am afraid to use this security system with my laptop .  but i did not face problems like changing the combination by its own .  you can use it without the alarm activation  ( i . e :  without batteries )  but the cable is so thin ,  it is not recommended to protect any valubles
i ordered this charger a month ago .  since ,  they've sent me three chargers all the same ,  all wrong .  they've sent me the shuffle charger three times in a row .  don't waste your money on this product ,  for a few bucks more you can get a company that will actually send you the right product the first time
of course as all things computer related ,  as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically .   unit works great but buy the 2 gig .   more bang for the $
these seemed like good headphones at first - but problems with portablity were huge !   the sound was good but 3 months into ownership one earpeice died so the phones are useless !  !  not worth spending time and money on these phones
from the photos and specs i thought this was  " the camera "  to have  ( both my wife and i loved the look of the camera from the photos we had seen )  .  there's always exceptions to rules ,  and the rule ,   " the more you pay ,  the more you get "  is the exception to the rule for this web camera .  after getting it ,  i had difficulty in getting the software to load but eventually had success .  i was very disappointed in the video quality .  there seemed to be a lot of noise in the picture ,  and tweaking gave no improvement .  i returned it to amazon and took a lose in the return shipping cost ,  but considered it worth it just to get the price of the camera back .  amazon lived up to their part and refunded the price paid  ( less return shipment )  with no hassle
i order this item and it got lost in the mail .  they resend it which was fine but ,  as soon as i recieve it i turn on the this item and the screen turned blank .  i advised not to buy this item
i was excited about consolidating 3 remote controls i regularly use plus my fan and light controls .   however ,  the harmony 890 has proved to be a big disappointment .   i was much better off with the 3 remotes i was using before .   it was much simpler than fooling with the harmony remote which requires so many key presses for basic functions .   i never have been able to get the harmony to control the fan and lights .some reviewers have said that you just need to take time to do the programming properly .   even if you do ,  in my case it's just easier to juggle my 3 remotes and press one button to do what it would take with several key presses on the harmony .my harmony is now going to sit with the other remotes i never use and i'll just stick to the 3 that work for me
i had this card for more than 6 months ,  and it worked super in my canon powershot a510 .  transfers went well too .  then all of a sudden for no reason i kept getting  " card error "  on my computer and digital camera a week ago .  my sd/usb converter couldn't find the card either .  i had really good photos i wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good .  what a joke
the second disc in this package was faulty ,  which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie .   there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the dvd+r .   not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best .i have switched to maxell
we ordered this radio to have on hand in case of emergency .   after an hour of cranking to start the power ,  the crank came off .   got it back on ,  cranked more ,  came off again .   small heartattack later from all the fruitless cranking ,  we sent it back the next day .   looking for another option for an emergency radio ,  haven't found one yet .
1 .   buttons are too small ,  some of which are not spaced apart very well  ( very convenient for somebody waking up who can accidentally hit the wrong button )  .2 .   buttons are labeled ,  organized ,  and layed out confusingly .   for example ,  why not have an  " alarm interface "  which would include all of the alarm modes and features ,  and maybe a  " radio interface "  which would include all of the radio functions/settings .   you would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock .   but really ,  don't do it ,  make the smart choice .3 .   too many features/modes .   i understand some people prefer all of the different features ,  but i wanted a simple alarm clock with a buzzer/radio ,  and clock .   of course all of these special modes are set as the default ,  so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode .   so for those who want a simple alarm clock ,  definitely do not get this !  !4 .   the button handling event is flawed .   for example ,  sometimes when i push a button ,  it does not handle the event  ( the device doesn't think that you pressed the button )  .   so i would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly .5 .   it is very slow when holding the button down and waiting for the alarm clock to increment up and down .6 .   radio reception is very poor .   i have another radio right next to it that gets much better reception than this clock .7 .   led is not very bright and hard to read from 10 feet and farther out .i have nothing against timex  ( they make great watches )  .   this was written to protect anyone who who does not want to waste $30 .
this is the best sounding pc speaker system available .  absolutley stellar sound quality--for how long is a serious problem .  i too own 2 of these systems .  after eleven months of bliss my first amp also went out .i call klipsch technical support ,  and they explain i can send it in but the amp is backordered for 4-6 weeks .  so i buy another one from amazon and thier retailer beach audio ,  inc .  ,  not having 4-6 weeks to wait for bliss to return .so get this please ,  not $360 plus tax once ,  but twice ,  and add 2 occurances of overnight shipping at $125 per ,  for a total spend of $970 plus tax !  !  !well blow me down but the replacement for amp #1 hasen't even showed up ,  and 6 working days of bliss later ?  you guessed it amp #2 fails .  klipsch ,  well they obviously picked quite a piece of crap for an amp .  they stand behind the product though--i have another rma to send to the fine people at the klipsch return center .the retailer this site uses ,  beach audio inc .  ,  offered me my money back ,  but would offer no replacement of any sort ,  and no refund for the $125 shipping charge .  nothing they wanted to do would help me get a working product .  they refered me to klipsch without mercy ,  or even lube .now klipsch makes some fine home audio  ( my klipschhorns are 15 years old ,  have been rocked to death ,  and still sound awesome )  ,  and this promedia ultra unit sounds fabulous--so i may do business with them again  ( perhaps not the pc multimedia division )  ,  but i vow to never give another red cent to amazon's retailer beach audio ,  inc .  .  they were uncooperative ,  unsympathetic ,  curt ,  short ,  unprofessional ,  and ultimately completely useless when contacted about the failure .please look elswhere for your next pc multimedia purchase !  !  !  !  !  !  !  the klipsch promedia division shouldn't ever be considered .
i've gone thru multiple revisions of firmware ,  and multiple calls to d-link support ,  and this piece of junk still does not work with the d-link dwl-g700ap .   d-link support calls are worthless .   as a computer professional ,  i find it appalling that d-link would introduce and continue to sell this product ,  which clearly does not operate correctly .
yes ,  yes ,  i know .  griffin has ipod mini compatability all over their roadtrip web page .  but the sad fact is ,  when you recieve it you will not find an adapter for the ipod mini in the box although there are adapters for other ipods .  when you read the instruction book you will find that you must purchase an adapter from apple computer to make it work .  calling apple ,  i find that they no longer sell the adapter .  when i called griffin i was surprised to find that if you have any other ipod than mini and the adapter is not in the box ,  they will send you one .  they recommended that i return the roadtrip ,  which is what i did .  save yourself the aggrevation -- if you have an ipod mini stay away from griffin technology
one of the two ends was broken
have had this router for over a year .   during this time the router constantly lost the internet connection ,  even when it's wired directly to my desktop pc .   the disconnect can last anywhere from a couple of seconds to minutes .   a new firmware  ( 1 . 23 )  was released a few days ago for revision a  ( the version of the router i have )  .   d-link's website said the firmware  " improved reliability "  so i decided to upgrade .   after flashing to the new firmware ,  the router will not let me into the control panel  or respond to pings .   the lights blink ,  that's all .   i've reset the router ,  but this does nothing to restore the old firmware .   d-link's firmware upgrade appears to have put this router out of its misery--which is perhaps for the best as it now forces me to finally go back to a reliable router company
this radio is poorly built .  when you set it down the little door in back opens and the batteries fall out .  you put them back in ,  carefully set it down ,  then when you pick it back up the little battery door falls open and the batteries fall out again .  .  . now ,  i put rubber bands around the whole radio to keep the battery door in place .  .  .  . stay away from this particular model unless you have lots of rubber bands .  .  . good luck and thanks for the opportunity to write the review .  .  .bruce payn
i bought this machine based on the good reviews i found here .  i have had it for one month and it does nothing but jam .   now the two week return policy at the store has expired and i am left with a jamming piece o' junk .my advice - look for a different fax machine
one day it just stopped working .  i got the dreaded  " orange and green flashing lights of death "  .  .  .  the contents of the file space were un-recoverable .  .  .  and i ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it .apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that apple likes to keep hush-hush
after burning one coaster ,  i thought ,  it's just a fluke .  i'll burn my first dvd in no time .  i was wrong .  after updating the firmware on my new plextor dvd burner and downloading the latest version of nero 6 ,  i burned two more coasters .   don't buy these unless you want pain and frustration
your buying 128 mb worth of frustration and $10 worth of gas from back and forth to wal-mart .i bought my creative muvo and had it for a month or so .  loved it .  had everything i needed ,  great mp3 worked great .  one day ,  plugged it in to put a song on it and all of the sudden it starts smoking .  big hole in it from all the smoke .  so ,  i return it at walmart for a new one .  two days later i plug it in my usb to put a song on it - smokes again !  !  !  !  !  !  !  i returned it and got my money back .  .  .  got an ipod shuffle ,  buy that much better mp3 player wont start on fire .  .  .
the box says you can either  " power "  or  " charge "  your ipod with the powerjolt .  to me ,   " power "  means listening to the ipod while it is plugged in to the powerjolt .    however ,  there is an overwhelming amount of buzz and static when the ipod is playing while connected to the powerjolt .   maybe this thing works ok to  " charge "  while the ipod is not playing ,  but it is not an acceptable way to  " power "  the ipod while it is playing .
one out of every 4 discs would fail on me when i'd burn to this media at 4x .  slowing down the burn to 2x didn't help either !  i own a sony dru500a with the latest firmware .  memorex isn't on their compatibility list .  lesson learned :  check the compatibility list before buying
i purchased the coby ca-739 wireless fm transmitter and was horrified by how each of its pre-programmed frequencies were major denver area radio stations or had high amounts of static .   the transmitter was noisy and weak .   i sent it back and took a restocking fee hit plus i had to pay for the return postage .i purchased the i-river which allows you to program your own frequencies .   low noise .  high quality .  much better .  .  .  .
these speakers are o . k .  ,  but don't expect high sound quality  ( i bought these as refurbs ,  so maybe that is it ,  but when you turn up the volume ,  they don't sound good - i'd recommend going to a store and testing units before buying new )  .   also ,  probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight - that is ,  they fade in and out when you walk around the room .   this should not be a problem on this low bandwidth  ( but it is )  ,  perhaps the antenna needs a boost
consumer beware !  !  !  !this product does not work as advertised .   if you put more than 1000 songs onto this device ,  on-the-go playlists cease to function .this is very ,  very sad for a player with 8gb of memory .  it's supposed to hold over 2000 songs ,  but stops working correctly after 1000 songs are loaded ?   wow .   unbelievable .this is a well-documented bug on the apple discussion forums ,  yet apple has neither acknowledged nor fixed this bug yet .   will they ever ?   who cares ?   why should they ,  if consumers like you keep buying it and raving about it ?i bought my 8gb nano ,  but returned it two days later when i found out the problem was known ,  but not fixed and not fixable .apple should not be shipping products with known bugs in them !   don't they test these things ?  !  ?  !  ?  !by the way ,  the same problem also occurs on the 4gb nano if you manage to squeeze more than 1000 songs onto it ,  which isn't all that hard to do .  .  .if you don't care about having more than 1000 songs ,  or you don't care about on-the-go playlists actually working as advertised ,  what are you doing shopping for an 8gb player ?   better stick with your 2gb models .  .
i bought this one for its coaxial cable protection function ,  but the result is terrible .  it greatly degrades the signal .  when i use it with tv ,  the program on tv became unclear .  when i use it with computer ,  the high-speed internet kept dropping .i intended to return it to amazon ,  and i found amazon's return policy is that only partial refund for opened products .  how can i know it's dysfunctional before i destroyed the package and used it ?  in the future ,  i only buy stuff at online stores with local stores ,  such as bestbuy or circuit city ,  so that i can easily get refund .
it did not work at all and amazon would not take it back saying it was my responsibility that it did not work .  i would never buy this or any other product from this seller
these labels were advertised with the seiko label printer .   they did not work with the printer because the printer requires thermal labels .   i sent these labels back to amazon and they promptly refunded my money
at first it wasn't a bad unit .   but it broke within a year .   now that i read the past reviews ,  i see i'm not alone .  .  .  .
its made of flimsy plastic ,  and all the parts snap on .  i'm afraid to put a heavy book on there ,  because i'm sure the parts will just snap off
problem #1 - out of hte box ,  these units are assigned 192 . 168 . 0 . 10 as an ip address .   find if your network is on the  . 0 subnet .   so i had to change my entire network over to this in order to get it configured .problem #2 - once changed ,  now i have ip address issues because of the existing clients picking up the  . 10 address .problem #3 - if you incorrectly specificy the ssid/wep key or ip address ,  you have to put it back to the defaults and start over .   there's no way to configure the unitproblem #4 - it just plain don't work as it should .easily the most difficult unit i've ever had to configure .   it's a shame that i'm swearing off linksys as their prices are good .   despite it's decent price ,  stay away from this one
we'll give the unit two stars instead of one ,  since when it does work ,  it works well ,  with nice print-outs .but in a span of two+ years ,  its has needed its drum replaced three times .   and has once needed the main system/circuit board replaced .   we'd purchased this back when it cost about $125 more than it does now .   and the parts have not been quickly available from some vendors .   we should have bought the heavier-duty brother 4750 which we use in another office ,  and has been flawless .
i live in the atlanta area and was never able to get a good sound quality coming from the belkin fm transmitter .   it seemed like i was listening to a fm station that was not coming in good
i've got a lite-on dvdrw sohw-1673s burner  ( revision js02 )  in my fast g4 mac running os x tiger and burning with toast titanium 7 .  although my burner is nominally 16x-capable ,  it only burns at about 6x in my setup ,  probably due to the slow  ( ata 33 )  bus it's on .i've used a number of different brands of 8x and 16x disks ,  both +r and -r ,  and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2% -- so few ,  in fact ,  that i often don't bother verifying video dvd's anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs .   ( i always verify data dvd's ,  since errors in those are not ignorable .  )  but with memorex ,  i've gotten about 20% failures ,  including a couple of aborted burns !  in one case ,  the disc had a blank band between two burned ones !the memorex discs i'm referring to have manufacturer id  " cmc mag ,  am3 "  .  according to videohelp . com ,  these are sold under at least 7 different brand names .  the reviews there are rather mixed ,  which is not imho good enough !i have not ,  btw ,  have had any problems with the memorex dvd+r discs i've tried .  but i stopped using them because one of my players won't recognize the +r format
bought this all-in-one printer and the install disc was bad .  prints test page every time i turn it on .  won't print .  jobs get stuck and cannot cancel .  spoke with customer service for 1 . 5 hours !  yes ,  that long .  they would not refund me and told me that i should have did a better job researching their products .  they got that right .  all i could get was a refurbished replacement that also performs like crap .  hp has lost a customer forever ,  and i am making it my mission to share with everyone how terrible they are with products and customer service .  canon ,  meet your next customer
love this phone .  .  .  .  . if only the caller id would work !   it worked fine on day 1 ,  day 2 worked on and off .  .  .  .  . day 3 caller id not working .   tried moving the phone to different outlets ,  removing the batteries & putting them back in ,  tried new wire etc .  .  .  .  the phone works great otherwise .   loved the caller id when it was working--much larger than most and easy to read .  oh well
device unexpectedly stopped working after 9 months .   has not been thru a washing machine ,  fallen in the ocean or been run over by a truck !   just nestled in my briefcase .   bullet-proof case is great gimick ,  but this device is unreliable as a backup for  " road "  files .   might be better off using your pda with a large sd card
bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera .  it worked for 2 days . after that ,  everytime i on the camera ,  it wanted me to reformat the card , wth is that ?now i can't use it at all .  .  .  .i'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon . one mistake i made , i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card ,  thought it worked and it would be ok . i can no longer return it now .needless to say , i'm too over confident with lexar's products .buyers beware .  .  .
pros* fits like a glove  ( goes without saying )* um .  .  .  peace of mind ?cons* this case makes pushing the buttons harder than it already is .* there is nothing to protect the screen .* if you're left-handed  ( or like to operate gadgets with your left hand )  note that it is impossible to push the menu button .  it would take a double-jointed freak of nature to comfortably push it .* the case is a dust and hair magnet .  every time you pull it out of your pocket ,  it's encrusted with lint you didn't even know you had .  dust manages to sneak under every surface ,  and hair magically sticks to it .  this case is a dna-sample paradise for forensic experts .one of the features of a flash-based memory player is the fact that they won't break as easily when you drop them .  unless you're paranoid about getting scratches on your shiny new sansa ,  don't buy this
i just purchased this product .  in the instruction manual ,  it states that only the brother ac adapter should be used and any other will invalidate the warranty .  why is it that only a brother adapter can be used when ac adapters are supposed to be standard ?  a tactic to increase sales ?  the adapter itself costs an additional 15 to 20 dollars .  in addition ,  i agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off .  the 2 line printing does look very nice .  i have not used many of the other features and so cannot comment on those
all i wanted was something to make the incoming audio louder while listening to a call and typing during an interview .  i couldn't find just a headset amp so i purchased this  " system "  based on plantronics' good name .instead of just plugging it into the wall phone jack ,  you have to use a regular phone ,  route the receiver/handset cord to this ,  then back out to the receiver/handset again ,  which makes this light unit basically hamstrung between the headset and handset and doesn't want to sit on the desk without taping it down .  then you have to take the receiver/handset off the hook ,  place it on the desk  ( assuming you have desk space ,  which i don't )  then push a button to start up the headset .most importantly ,  listening sound quality was muffled and not very loud .  if i turned up the incoming sound volume ,  it immediately put a loud annoying squeal of feedback into the microphone ,  making it totally unusable .i went back to my regular ,  unampflied plantronics headset which just plugs into the wall phone and is always on with no extra cords ,  ac adapter ,  or buttons to push .  i'm not very thrilled with that ,  but for $15 it sounds much better and much louder ,  without the feedback or the hassles .  so for now i guess i'll stick with that until i find something else that just improves the incoming sound
never received the item .   have to go thru the process of filing a claim with ups for lost/not delivered item .  no way to complain to amazon . com .
i cannot review this item since i have not received it so far at the shipping address i gave amazon when i did the purchase .i bought four items ,  and i only got two of them by mail .what happened to the other two items ?-koss stereo in ear ear plugs - the spark plug  ( purchased on 09/15/2006 )-apple ipod usb travel kit with car charger ,  travel adapter & cable  ( purchased on 09/15/2006 )who knows .  .
agree with the prior reviewers .   i can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses !
ordered it ,  took about 5 days to get to me ,  and it's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it
dvds are less than 30 dollars now with 16x speedand look at amazon  , it is still selling then above 40  ( only 8x speed
the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car .   the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it .   i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail .   i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded
i bought the armband when i got my mini ipod .  however ,  the belt clip that comes with the ipod is perfect to clip to my shorts while jogging .  you don't need this large ,  clunky armband
i bought this printer about 4 months ago .   the prints are beautiful ,  and the speed quite good as well .   however ,  i felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of  " x "  color installed .   it happens now between every print job ,  forcing me to open the printer ,  pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks ,  and then print my document .   there is something wrong with this thing ,  and i don't appear to be the first experiencing it .   figures .  .  .  i wait eight years to replace my printer ,  and end up with one that malfunctions !  i will attempt to return this item
when i plugged these in they worked fine for about seven minutes ,  then the speaker's internal power simply cut off .  happened on the ac adapter or batteries ,  whether i was using my computer or my ipod as the sound source .  same behavior every time .logitech sent me a replacement from a new production run ,  same thing happened .  sent it back to logitech on my nickel ,  got another replacement from same production run  ( product id :  a612 )  .  same problem .after two months and many long waits for logitech tech support ,  i'm giving up .  maybe it was just a bad run ,  or maybe my environment is flukey ,  but i'm sorry i ever bought this thing
i wanted an original apple usb cord for my ipod ,  and the description said this is ,  but it isn't .  so if you're like me and you want the original ,  don't buy this one
i received the ipod quickly which was a plus .  but it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs .  i had friends who have the same ipod try to fix it and it never worked .  i sent it back and requested a refund .  it has been a month and a half and i have yet to get my $120 back .
it's not often i find a product that's as disappointing as this .  the interference problem is very serious and makes most conversations a pain .  moving around the house and outside of the house ,  standing on your head holding the phone at a 45 angle ,  etc .  ,  are part of the daily ritual in trying to hold a legibible conversation .but that's not the bad part .  the bad part ,  as at least one other reviewer has noted ,  is that each of the phones constantly reports a   " low charge "  message or something similar .  this in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time .  the only solution i've found is to take the battery out of phone and put it back in .  then it will work for a day or two .  i suppose it could be just the batteries .  but if so then we were shipped batteries that were already on life-support .i read a few good reviews of this phone ,  and of course there are a number right here .  but out experience has been the opposite .  the phones have been nothing other than a pain
i just got these at a local store and they just really blow !  !  !  i was swayed by the brand name and the great price  ( although higher than amazon )  .  it's true when they say you get what you pay for .  .  .  rock-bottom price = rock-bottom performance .  terrible to say the least .  mine are going back right now .
from cellphone and also the pager era i began my love affair with motorola .   don't need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it .   sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great !   don't buy these !   they fall into the former categoryi needed them quickly  ( to give my in-laws time to practice using them before we went on a cruise )  so when i went to their house for the weekend i bought them from the hated  " best buy "  .   i am returning all 4 !   ( 2 sets of 2 handsets )  .   here was my experience :i went in and saw the midland and the cobra along side the motorola .   not knowing much of midland ,  but recognizing cobra from their history with low-end phones and electronics ,  i opted with the very stylish motorola t6500r's .   i know .   big mistake !   i am a computer programmer and very intelligent ,  but when confronted with products i do not undestand ,  i go for the brand name .   which is something that can be forgiven if ,  as now ,  you find out what the problem is and correct it .i took them home and recharged them .   first things first :   the feel in your hand .   excellent .   they feel as good as they look .   i purchased these to go on a cruise to the mexican riviera and to maintain contact both on the boat and in the ports :  puerto vallarta ,  mazatlan and cabo san lucas .   we wanted to make sure we did not  " lose "  my in-laws  ( really !   i mean it !   no ,  really  .  .  .  .  )anyway .  charged them up and turned them on .  they come with a plastic-encased group of 3 aa rechargable batteries that fit nicely  ( and only one way--they are keyed )  in the dual-purpose battery compartment .   this is nice :  if you are out and running around and your charge goes down ,  simply buy 3 aa alkaline batteries and go on your way .   there is no problem if you forget you have the normal non-rechargable aa batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand .   unlike other units ,  the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack ,  not the handset .   if you put it batteries ,  the charger makes no connection to the handset .  if you put in the rechargable battery pack ,  2 silver contacts from the battery pack  contact the charging stand and voila the unit charges .   fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare ,  though !   it must be generic and able to fit several different motorola products  ( production outsourced to giant int'l ltd--so if you thought this was a genuine motorola built item ,  you are mistaken .   the entire talkabout line are outsourced for production )  as the dual-compartment charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the t6500r's .   i am a smart person though so i chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it .   then i attempted to insert the t6500r's .   i say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction .   after you get it to exactly the right position  ( look on the charger to watch for the led to light up )  the the hard part  ( of charging ,  that is )  is over .next item :  bad red lcd backed screen .   hard to read in any light and impossible in the sunlight .   settings were easy enough .   channel ,  sub-channel ,  vibrate ,  noaa broadcasts ,  etc .   however ,  the advertised qt  ( ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible motorola handset )  does not work unless you hit the ptt  ( push to talk )  button  ( or the call button )  ,  wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking .   my in-laws are new to technology and are used to experiencing walkie-talkies when their kids were young .   therefore this is unusual .   they automatically want to push the button and talk .   so ,  the first part of what they say is immediately lost .i say  " first part "  .   i am assuming i actually caught a portion of what they said .   this brings me to the second major flaw .   this unit contains a horrible speaker .   if the volume is too low then you can't hear it .   too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it .   we were really hard-pressed to find a happy medium .   and ,  in a noisy room ,  it would've been impossible to hear anything .some merchants list these as 5 mile radios .   the packaging says 10 .   the 1 watt gmrs suggests about 5-10 .   we got less than 1 .   directly over a lake .  in vehicles on the i-5 ,  we drove less than 2 miles from their house   ( which is directly on the interstate )  and got no signal .i got back to my house in san jose  ( on top of communications hill .  .  . the largest  " hill "  in the area )  and could not communicate to my spouse less than 1/2 mile away while he was coming up our road !since the weekend ,  i have spent all my extra time on amazon . com and consumer reports reviewing all the offerings .    ( the latter ,  consumer reports' reviews are from july in 2002 !  )  so ,  i think i am going to return these and purchase the midland 5 watt gxt500's from amazon .   remember ,  doubling the wattage  ( in this case more than doubling )  does not give double the signal .   as another others have stated ,  increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distance--ie :  2 watts to 4 watts does not double the distance the signal can reach .  )hope this reveiw helps you
i don't know if i just got a bad pair of radios ,  but they didn't work at all .   if we were beyond shouting distance the radios did not receive any signal at all .   even at very close range there was too much static to understand anything .   i'll post a review of the sx700s after we get a chance to try them out
the only reason i bought this unit when i saw it in the store was for the ipod controller feature .   i really looked forward to being able to control my ipod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight .   boy was i disappointed !   the ipod adpater works and all .  .  .  but barely .   it takes forever to scroll through the songs ,  artists or albums .   why the hell would alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the ipod so you can't even select songs from the ipod itself ?   i have over 3000 songs on my ipod .  .  .  by the time i scroll to the song i want i've already reached my destination .  .  .  and that's if i even find the song at all !   so now what i have to do is unplug my ipod ,  scroll to the song i want ,  then plug it back in .   ( luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your ipod in .  )   but again .  .  .  that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck .   bottom line ,  the ipod control feature flat sucks .   the deck features a  " quick search "  function .  .  .  but it is uselss .  .  .  it isn't used to search through artsts or albums .  .  .  only individual songs and there's no way to skip 10 ,  20 ,  30 or 100 songs at a time .  .  .  only 1 by 1 .  .  .  what's  " quick "  about that ?    i have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and alpine thinks i'm supposed to go through them 1 by 1 ?  ?  ?  ?  another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the ipod is playing ,  the display just says  " song up "  or  " song down "  instead of just showing the name of the damn song !   who thought of that ?   what possible help could  " song up "  be to anyone ?  just show the name of the song while i'm skipping through .  .  .  that makes more sense right ?   there are a bunch of other problems i have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the ipod adapter and ipod .  .  .  but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing .  .  .  but then again .  .  .  who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to
i won't recommend to any body .  you have the same way of charging thru your computer .  i think is waste
yeah ,  they claim this thing works with ms powerpoint .  but what they do not tell you is that it only works with part of powerpoint .  it only works in slide mode .  it does not work in presentation view mode .  of course ,  most of my presentations are run in presentation view mode .so the remote is useless .  and they have no fix for it .  they cannot even document that this is the case .i am going to look for something else .  maybe the microsoft remote .***update***it's true ,  this presenter has problems with powerpoint's presenter view because in that mode pgup and pgdown keys are used to scroll the notes .  however ,  here's a neat trick i discovered that makes it work again :- start the presentation in presenter view- pres  " b "  on your keyboard to show a blank screen- click the mouse  ( anywhere in the blank screen )  once to resume the presentation and then again to advance to the next slide- magically ,  from this point on the presenter buttons work flawlessly .
can't say much for the video or sound quality ,  menu options ,  or anything really ,  since this thing broke after 2 minutes of watching monsters ,  inc .  on dvd .   playback just froze ,  the thing stopped recognizing that dvds were in unless you turned the thing off and then back on again ,  and after another minute it wouldn't even start  playing the thing at all ,  just whirred a lot .so ,  dud
i adore my nano ,  but this armband is one of the worst products i have ever bought .   i work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout .   the spacing of the velcro dots means i never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime i do weight lifting close to my body .     it is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is .   i am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage .
this may be one of the cheapest routers out there ,  but it's cheap in every way .  i spent hours either on hold or talking with poorly trained overseas  " tech support "  whose expertise consisted of  ( barely )  reading a script .  eventually these computer whizzes determined that my d-link router didn't work .  they told me to send it back  ( on my nickel ,  of course )  ,  and they sent me another one ,  which also did not work ,  at least not with my computer system .  after more wasted hours ,  i was referred to the one guy at d-link who--supposedly--has mastered this router's bugs .  the problem ?  he never answered the phone .  and despite all my calls to him and all my voicemails asking him either to call me at work or to set a time for us to talk ,  he repeatedly returned my calls at 3 : 00 in the afternoon ,  the time when most people who can afford routers are working .  finally i had an epiphany :  life was too short to %*&#@ with d-link .  i packed up the router and sent it back to the ceo ,  stephen joe ,  with a letter .  then i went out and bought a netgear router ,  and i was up and running in minutes .  mr .  joe never responded to my letter ,  but what else do you expect from a company that so clearly doesn't value its customers
i purchased this armband to hold my nano during workouts .   the band barely fits my arm and tends to slide down the arm while running or cross training .   looking for a replacement right now
it's the most expensive cf card with absolutely no customer support .   after a while the cf card stopped working - no power light as if the card &quot ; burned out&quot ;  .   i really can't tell you exactly what went wrong because it's impossible to contact someone at socket customer support .  i followed their web-site instructions but was never contacted .  i'll never buy another socket product again
spare sd card slots molded into the lid of this case prevent it from closing completely around the tungsten e .  you will see a noticeable gap around the bottom edge of the closed case .  slight pressure on the latch side side will cause the case to pop open unexpectedly in purse or brief case .  i returned mine to amazon a few days after receipt ;  still looking for an alternative
buy the  " empty "  player for 37 ,  then get a 128 mb card .  .  .  . its only 5 bucks mopre total .  .  .  .  .
i had to buy a new one ,  and i chose another brand  ( logitech )  this time .there is no on/off button ,  so the batteries run out if you don't take them out  ( i think the buttons are pressed during transportation )  .  now the battery contacts are not functioning properly .and i had the same problem described in a recent review :   " i'll click three or four times and nothing happens .  then ,  i'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end .  it's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen .  "
although this policy is thru apple ,  it is 2x the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations .   one is crutchfield . com which has a 2 yr .  plan for $29 . 99 which starts *after* the standard apple 1 yr labor coverage  ( for a total of 3 years )  .   apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for $59 . 99 ,  rather than a total of 3 years for $29 . 99 thru crutchfield
i just bought a new ratpadzgs to replace my four year old ratpadz .  compaired to the old ratpad ,  the ratpadzgs is made with a lower density cheap-o ( tm )  plastic and tracks poorly with my logitech g7 mouse .  when using the mouse on the gs it causes the curser to sort of stutter along .  overall i would pass on this product ,  for now my desk actually works better than this mousepad .
like most have pointed out ,  it's a digital signal and there's no need for all the gas-injected ,  gold plated ,  shielded stuff monster cables hype .   for analog signals this stuff absolutely makes a difference because analog cables are highly affected by outside em interference .some people have pointed out that monster cables are more durable .   so yes ,  if you plan on swinging around on your cables it might matter .   if ,  like most people ,  you plug the stuff in behind your equipment then leave it be for months and months ,  don't waste your money
just plugged it in and i'm ready to ship it back .  creates an annoying ,  high pitched buzz
if you can't abide an ever-present low hiss in the background ,  and louder interference in the presence of power lines ,  don't buy this product .   i wish i'd read the reviews more carefully before i bought .   a number of even the most favorable ones mentioned this annoyance .the manufacturer replaced the first unit after i complained ,  but it was no improvement .   this may be the best product of its type out there ,  but it still comes up short .
though i like the keyboard ,  i've found two serious problems with the mouse .   first ,  it is very sensitive to movement .   i've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control .   finally and more importantly ,  the mouse burns a set of aa batteries about every 8 days .   i only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so i should be getting a lot more battery life .   i've bought other logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case i wish i had bought another brand .
yesterday was the annual thanksgiving sale day .  i got this 1g cf card from staples by $40 after easy rebate .  with this price ,  i think it is a great deal .  however ,  it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was dead .  all my photos in the card were lost .  i am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering ,  i know how to recover data if a hard drive fails .  but this time ,  i find i simply can't help .  fortunately ,  staples have a good return policy and i just returned it without hassle .  hopefully ,  this is only my case .  my suggestion :  make sure your dealer has a good return policy before you get this item .
the extendable arm breaks very easily .   i had two of them and they both broke within the first month .   the company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement .   very poor product .   do not buy
i had this 6 months  ( which is how long it takes to figure out how to use it !  )  and the backlight is no longer working .  so i can't see the time ,  without a flashlight or lamp
the sandisk 512 mb secure digitial ultra ii  ( sdsdh-512-901 )  sent to me was not the item i ordered .   i returned the item ,  unopened
i liked this when i first got it .  .  .  very cheap ,  handy to travel with or leave at work ,  etc .  after a couple months ,  it died completely .  .  .  the little power light wouldn't even come on .  i'm really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesn't work .
i read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport and low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank  ( i'm on a plane frequently )  .  i wanted something that i wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels .  i found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug  ( like maybe at your desk at work )  .  the weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still .  so then i thought these will be great workout headphones  ( won't be upset if i break or lose them )  ,  however ,  the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand .  the effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience  ( even when you are sitting stationary at your desk )  .  it is similar to wearing a stethescope ,  which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones  ( which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise )  .  i do not recommend these headphones ,  because of this stethescope effect- i could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses  ( they are after all designed to wear behind the head )  .  i'm on the hunt for better quality headphones
i bought the sony 128 mb memory stick  ( msh-128 )  a few months ago ,  but i only used it once .  when i was in my 20th picture ,  an error appeared in the screen of my sony p100 camera :error c : 13 : 01 ,  memory stick failedfirst ,  i went to sony service center ,  but they didn't know what was happening .  then ,  i went to different sony stores ,  but the only answer they gave me was that my memory stick is failed ,  that it's impossible to fix or format it and ,  the worst ,  there is no way to save the pictures  !  !  !  !finally ,  i tried to solved it by myself ,  and i  " google "  the c : 13 : 01 error .  if you do it ,  you will find hundreds of people with the same problem ,  looking for a solution .that's why i don't recommend this product .  if all of us have the same problem ,  you can be the next
i guess for $50 ,  this is an ok product .   i am usually very against monster products ,  but i'd seen this for almost double at big box retailers ,  needed a surge protector for my new dlp tv ,  so figured what the heck .   it arrived without incident ,  i hooked it up and so far so good .   it basically a power strip with labels that also happens to be purple .  .  .  for the  " neato "  effect i guess .   anyways ,  no idea if its worth more than your run of the mill surge protector .   but the claims of independent circuitry to minimize cross-interference is what i was really interested in ,  as i have my reciever ,  cable box ,  dvd player ,  and subwoofer all connected .  .  .   all in all a good buy i guess ,  at least you paid a lot less than retail .  .  .   :
i ordered 2 of these ,  realizing they would have limited adjustment range - other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel .  what prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight .  this model is supposed to hold a 25 lb .  monitor ;  it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb .  imac .  there is no tension adjustment  ( already as tight as it would go )  and the computer just flopped forward .  with a light monitor ,  i'm sure it would be fine ,  but don't expect even close to the stated 25 lb .  rating .
i posted a review two weeks ago ,  but it hasn't appeared ,  so i'm trying again .  .  . i bought this lock two years ago .   it has always been difficult to remove .    ( note :   despite what some other reviewers seem to think ,  it does not have a motion detector - that's a different lock .  )   recently ,  the lock decided to remain firmly inside my ibook ,  despite my efforts to remove it .   after a fruitless call to targus's customer support ,  i finally got it out .   that took over 30 minutes of struggle .   my next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw .   apparently ,  the targus lock is not a good fit for ibooks .   i'm going to send mine back and demand compensation .   if you own an ibook ,  i strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than targus
very disappointing speakers !rip off .i returned them .1 . 	satellites produce static noise even with the computer turned off .  you have to press the mute button to get rid of it .2 . 	extremely rumble base ;  not crisp .  even turned all the way down it is too prominent .  maybe good for war games .3 . 	missing mid tone .  satellites sound like they are coming out off a tin can .4 . 	volume is a bit underpowered .  will not knock your socks off
i actually meant to order the philips 7-incher  ( brighter screen ,  $20 cheaper ,  bulkier )  ,  but somehow i got confused when i placed the order .  .  . this one looked beautiful so i was pretty psyched anyway and was definitely going to keep it .   i was planning on using this for work ,  as i get a lot of dvd's from clients - so i popped one of those in and guess what ?   it came up as  " invalid disc "  .   it's supposed to play the majority of formats ,  and i triple checked the disc in my other dvd players ,  and it worked in my panasonic dvd/vhs combo player .   a store-bought dvd worked fine  ( although i didn't play it much more than the first menu )  so i know it's not broken .the first reviewer also noticed that it doesn't play a bunch of homemade dvd's ,  so i will confirm that here - if that's gonna be a deal-breaker for you then stay away .   btw ,  the dvd i was trying to play was made on a philips burner .   i didn't bother to test it with any others
i bought this phone for use in my home office based on the rave reviews on this site for its speakerphone .   unfortunately ,  i have had nothing but repeated complaints that the voice is distorted or goes in and out ,  with the beginnings and ends of sentences frequently cut off .   i am in the market for another phone after just 2 months
i like the phone's simplicity and ergonomics .  it's fatal flaw is the lack of range .  my office is about 50ft away from the base ,  and i get unacceptable interference .  both plain old at&t & ge 900 handle this distance without any problems
i bought four of these and returned them immediately .  two were dead out of the box .  a third had horrible sound .after searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products i finally settled on the 900 megahertz wireless intercom from radio shack .   ( 43-3102 )beautiful sound .  well made and about half the price of the reporter .  pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet .  so if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider .  better warranty than the reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year .anyway i couldn't be happier with the rs intercom .  i just can't recommend the reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty
compared this cable to a philips performance component cable and i am not impressed it was the exact same in picture quality .all your paying for is the name .  .why spend 50$ when you can spend 20$ on the philps and get the same thing ?
bought these pretty cheap ,  from woot . com .the good :- great sound quality ,  all digital transmission so no hissing .- look good- decent battery lifethe bad :- needs drivers  ( most usb headsets - granted ,  not wireless - don't )- doesn't work on the mac- if you are not playing music ,  they beep every 15 seconds or so .  then after a couple of minutes they turn themselves off .  this drove me crazy and was not configurable .- takes you ~15 seconds every time you turn them on and try to pair them .- not terribly comfortable .after about a month of normal use ,  the headset cracked in the middle and stopped working .  bad quality o material .  the logitech people said they will refund whatever i paid for after i send them a copy of the receipt and the broken product .  too bad i get to pay for shipping and i'm not even sure they'll refund the original shipping .  lesson learned
i wish the description had beem better .  somethimg like this phone needs another unit to work !  people who have never seen an expansion phone can be missled like i was .  returned item
the remote control is ok .but the earbuds are horrible !  they are very sensitive to your particular  " ear anatomy "  .  i suppose they fit for some people ,  but for me they are useless .  they stay in for a few seconds ,  but don't dare do anything like running ,  walking ,  or moving your head and expect them to stay in .much better to get lightweight headphones with an over-the-head or behind-the-head band ,  or even the models with  " hooks "  that fit over the top of your ears .
essentially once tomtom has your money they're finished with you  .   .   .  until you want to spend more money with them .the product is okay .  the map data is from teleatlas ,  a vendor to many of the map software producers .  what makes tomtom different is its gui  ( graphic user interface )  that the user interacts with .  it really is a work of art most of the time .  the map presentations are rich and may be viewed as 3d or 2d .  the planning interface is icon driven and easy-to-use .  unfortunately tomtom really didn't think it all the way through .there are several irritants ,  all of which vie for first place .  one is that tomtom doesn't give you the option of using its maps without a gps .  there are many instances where i know where i am begining from and going to and i don't need a gps fix .  tomtom ignores such desires and annoyingly keeps prompting for you to start your bluetooth connection .  there is one mode that you can use to plan a route without a gps and it simply doesn't work very well ,  often informing you that tomtom can't route you from a point beginning on an interstate to another point further along the same highway .  that's just plain dumb .  this is a mapping application .  if i want to use these expensive maps for walking directions without a gps ,  i should be able to .  tomtom certainly doesn't think so .another irritant is the documentation .  probably in an effort to make tomtom appealing to the casual user ,  the documentation is dog simple  .   .   .  and often wrong .  it appears that they didn't update the documentation to the newest version .although you can load maps by region ,  tomtom makes no allowance for travelling from one region to another .  you have to calculate your route to the ending point within one region and then begin it anew in the next region .  again ,  this strikes me as a silly omission .  if you are in wisconsin ,  which is one region ,  and drive to minnesota ,  which is in another ,  you have to create two routes .  not bright .there are a number of idiosyncracies ,  anomalies and bugs that drive me up a wall .  however ,  overall ,  tomtom is still better than the competition .  it computes routes quickly  ( when it is capable of figuring a route at all )  .  annoying ,  however ,  it tends to prefer expressways ,  regardless of your preferences .  in a major metro area laced with expressways going in all directions ,  this can create some incredibly convoluted - and ridiculous - routes .  creating alternative and more logical routes is possible ,  but tedious .the worst part of the tomtom experience is its customer support .  well ,  perhaps support is the wrong word for it .  i encountered two problems installing the software .  it was obviously that the tech support person was clueless and was simply guessing and grasping at straws .   ( i had resolved the issues before the rep called and already knew what the problem was .  )  the tomtom rep didn't listen ,  kept interrupting and when it was pointed out that he was contradicting the manual ,  he just kept moving .   ( the manual in at least one instance was correct and the rep wrong .  )the tomtom packaging itself arrived in broken condition .  the rep denied it was their packaging ,  claiming that i must have bought a third-party repackaged product .  talk about insulting :  i have the package in front of me with the tomtom labels ,  the whole works and this guy is telling me that my lying eyes are deceiving me ?a fax to tomtom management about my experiences has gone unanswered more than a week later .tomtom is riding high right now but i suspect in a couple of years as competitors introduce better products with better support that tomtom will be history .  it won't be the first company that offered a good-enough product without support and possesing contempt for its customers to disappear and it won't be the last .i know that if i find a marginally better product with adequate support ,  i'd abandon tomtom in a flash .jerr
the keyboard and mouse work fine ,  except for some completely absurd reason ,  logitech decided to remove the insert and escape keys from the regular keyboard and make them little buttons on the top of the keyboard instead .  look at the picture and you will see what i mean -- the delete key is double-size and takes up the space where the insert key would be ;  insert is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button .   escape is in the usual place ,  but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key .   very annoying .   definately returning it
these are some great headphones ,  buy them from somewhere else !  i chose to buy them here because of the lower price ,  big mistake ,  what i recieved wasen't the item picutered .  i don't know if there an older version or some knock-offs ,  the sound is ok .  .  .  but there very cheaply made and theres something wrong with the hinges they don't fold properly .  i have an average size head and even fully extended to put them on you have to warp the headband to the point that it looks like its about to break .  returned them and spent the extra 20 bucks to buy them from the actual site
in terms of sound quality ,  noise cancelling ,  and general comfort - thise headphones are top of the line .  i absolutely love the way the sound and the ammount of noise cancelling that they provide .  i used them regularly when mowing the lawn and when flying ,  and i always recieved the highest quality sound and noise cancelleation .  i was even able to listen to drum-n-bass while mowing the lawn and hear all of the appropriate frequencies on the low end .however .  .  .  inside of 6 months ,  i have gone through 2 pairs of these headphones because the right ear headphone has gone out on them .  the worst part is - i can't even begin to imagine why it goes out .  i keep my heaphones in a locked cabinet in my office every night .  last friday ,  i placed back into the nice little carry bag that they come with ,  and placed them into this cabinet .  this morning when i pulled them out for use ,  the right ear bud is out again .  .  .  no physical damage is apparent anywhere on the headphones ,  and there is not a broken wire anywhere .  in fact ,  the wiring is perfectly fine and still functional .  it is the physical earbud - the hard plastic peice - that has gone out .  if i squeeze the earbud hard enough ,  it will turn on again .something inside of the earbud is obviously designed improperly and i would highly recommend that noone purchase these headphones because of this
i was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack .  they are rated at 2000 mah ,  but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames .  my 2 year old panasonic 1600 mah in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots .  i tried these batteries in my mp3 player - and even there ,  it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback .  it is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has .  but it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices .  it seems to be all right for use in a flashlight .  a set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight  ( a bit dimly )  for hours  ( yeah - i tested it )  .  for the test ,  i had  charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration  ( it is not a charger issue )  .i plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs .one last tip - nowadays ,  the best nimh batteries are made by sanyo .  it is better to pay 2 - 4 times for them than for a lenmar .  trust me
the price on the cases is cheap but you get what you pay for .   i will never buy these cases again .   quite a few of them were broke when i got them .   even the ones that weren't broke are made of very flimsy plastic and i have a feeling they will break if i open them very often .   they also don't open and shut very easy .   look elsewhere for good cases
sucks i had this right form the start with my compaq 7970 which is amd k7 processor and has the via chipset .   the computer seemed to work for a while or at least had few errors when i first used it but i guess that was when i had windows 98 for 2 years .  when i upgraded to windows xp it just got terrible i had frequent blue screens and errors .  i thought it was my video card or my ram or irq sharing tried all that didn't seem to be it .   eventually i was wrong it was this card as mentioned before by others apparently it does not like some amount of internet use and when the card gets stuck it shuts down and windows xp just says error or points to the video card or irq sharing ot page fault in non page area as the problem .   the card was the problem buy another card other than fa310 , fa311 the one i have and fa312 even if you have intel or something else i would not waist my money on this card it will probably give you problems down the road .   i have tried updates from  [  .  .  .  ]  and updating my ram and video card  have checked my irqs and reformating hard drive none worked .  i put in a 3 com card i bought a few years before this computer and wow no crashes that other computer is now wirelessly connected to my home network
adorama is a terrible company to deal with .  they sent me a pkg of 2 epson ink cartridges and 270 papers .   i have called several times as the ink cartridges were not the correct ones .  i returned them as instructed ,  written 3 letters and called .  this started in mid july .   i called 2 weeks ago  ( aug 28th and a different gal said she thought i should have my money back and would see to it .   that was over 2 weeks ago and nothing since then .i would recommend that anyone should not order from this company
these speakers sound great - but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that's a no-no .  so you reach for your phones and .  .  .  no place to plug them in !  how lame is that ?  also whoever designed the volume/on/off knob is an idiot .  the thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it ,  the whole speaker just slips away from you .  they're so light that they don't have enough resistance to stay put .  so you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other  ( unless you velcro them to your desk or something )  .  too bad because - like i said - they sound great
when i purchased these batteries ,  i was very pleased ,  but that wore off after a couple of months .  i don't use my camera all that often ,  but when i do ,  i expect ther batteries to have some charge .  i recharge them per instructions ,  and they do not hold a charge any longer . i know monster makes good products ,  but i am a little disappointed in this one
this bracket will not fit the etrex vista cx .  this is because the battery cover supplied with the bracket  ( replaces the original battery cover to provide attachement lugs )  will not clear the microsd card socket .  this is very frustrating because the garmin website even shows this bracket ,  part number 010-10361-00 ,  in the etrex vista cx accessories list .  so if you have a cx ,  don't purchase this item
mine worked great for the first few months ,  then i started getting the  " warning ,  check battery "  .   if you take the batteries out and reinsert ,  it works for a few hours but then the same warning message comes up .   it happened on both headsets .   i called customer service and they told me this is the first time they've ever heard that  ( uh huh - doesn't sound like it from the reviews here )  .   a little too expensive to replace yearly .  .
i purchased this game pad due to good reviews .found it online for $15 with free shipping so had to try myself .its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand .the programming software is alright as well ,  not as nice asthe nostromo n50/52 software for example .but what i didnt like about it was much more relavant .firstly there is a toggle lock shift button .this button is easy to press by accident and since it is nota momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian .interupting game play .also buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb ,  and quite far from normal thumb use .  i had a hard time using those buttons quickly .also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10 .and finally ,  for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in nhl06 ,  i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back ,  and ill soon go with the logitech
the only thing this item is good for is charging your ipod .   the transmitter is so weak all you hear is static buzz with muffled music in the background .     don't waste your money .   and ,  don't expect any help from the manufacturer who  refuses to answer emails or accept a warranty return .
after a bit of sweat i've managed to get the printer working fine from both my xp and mac os tiger computers   .  .  .  .  .  .  until i unplug the direct ethernet cable to the router that is needed for set-up .   then nothing happens i . e .  no wireless printing .i suspect it's an ip addressing issue having read a helpful article here  ( take note d-link - amazon is becoming a better support site than your own !  )  .   changing the ip address messes up my internet connection during install ;  the mac works quite hard to re-establish the internet connection & perhaps this breaks the connection to the printer ?  i dunno ,  but it's giving me a headache .documentation & troublshooting help are very ,  very weak & time will tell if d-link on-line support are any better  ( 22 hours & no response from them yet .  .  .  .  )i'm sure network wizards will have this little beasty up & running in no time ,  but for normal people it's ,  well ,  a bit of a pain
i bought this unit on a wim .   i was leaving for a business trip and needed a gps .   i really like it and it worked well for me .   unfortunalty the unit wouldn't hold a charge on the battery .   so i returned it for another one .   it worked for one week and then i had the same exact problem .   which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units .   when i tried to return this unit ,  the unit i was given didn't work at all ,  it gave me an error message when the gps booted up .   unfortunaltey the vendor i purchased it from didn't have any more units that i could exchange it for .   so i called customer service and got an ran .   i am hoping when i get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that i don't have any more problems
.  .  . so i was satisfied with the noise-cancelling qualities .  the cloth cable is very nice and doesn't tangle as much as the usual plastic ones .  i liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning .  the headphones i purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and i found only one to be suitable for my ears .  of course ,  after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now i can't use these earphones until i find a replacement somewhere ,  which is proving to be troublesome .  super .  i didn't buy these on clearance at target so that hurts my pocketbooks and i am very annoyed right now .  in the meantime ,  i've returned to some $10 non-earbud headphones and i really miss the noise-cancelling quality of these philips earbuds .  life sucks and i want to die because now i can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation .
i ordered the passport x50 from amazon to save the $18 shipping escort radar was charging .  i was told by someone at escort radar that amazon was an authorized reseller .after having my detector on for ten minutes  ( right out of the box )  ,  it did three  " self cal " s ,  then said  " service required "  .  i called escort radar and was told  " if you let the car power up the unit when you start the car ,  the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused .  you must first start the car ,  and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector .  "  it makes some sense ,  but if this is really the case ,  why don't they put those instructions in their manual ?  after trying this many times ,  the unit was  " still confused "  ,  so i returned it for a replacement .my second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened .  this time escort radar told me  " if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night ,  this has been found to cause problems .  "  well my lighter power goes off when i turn off the ignition ,  so this doesn't apply .  escort radar also told me that  " excessive heat "  has been causing them problems .  now we have had a few days of 100� heat ,  and i'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun ,  but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car .  it gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country .  there are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90� or leaving it off in a hot car .  you wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35� ,  would you ?  ?  ?the most troubling part of my conversation with escort radar service department was they told me amazon is not an authorized reseller ,  and they have no idea where they are getting the units from .  furthermore ,  they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit ,  not even for money .
i assumed all tape adapters were comparable .   this one worked fine for 1 week .   then it sporadically ejected itself from the tap deck .   a few days later it broke completely and is now jammed in my tape deck .   the tape deck on my car stereo is now broken as is the macally podtape .   i would buy another a different brand of adapter ,  but i no longer have a tape deck that works in my car .   my worst purchase on amazon to date .
replaced first spindle and still junk .  will always stick with verbatim from now on
ok .  this is the 2nd ipod mini transmitter i have purchased that has broken within a month .  all of a sudden it just stops working ,  for no apparent reason .  don't waste your money .  it's a piece of junk
my friend bought one and i tried to set it up for him .   let me tell you ,  this thing is pure garbage .   i spent a good hour and a half trying to get it to work .   i tried to set it up using 2 laptops which were set up exactly how the booklet outlined .   the direct ethernet connection wouldn't work and connecting to it through wireless was spotty at best .   i could sometimes get into the setup page through wireless ,  but all of a sudden the setup page would stop working .stay away from d-link !   all their products are cheaply made and difficult to configure
i so wanted to love this thing .  i have an ipod that i am seldom without ,  and my car isn't ipod compatible .  i bought a monster wireless fm transmitter/charger so i could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion .  unfortunately ,  the thing just didn't work for me .there are 8 preset stations  ( low on the dial )  and if all of them are in use ,  you're out of luck .  i don't live in a huge city  ( maybe 60 , 000 with farmland all around )  ,  but only two of these stations were available .  although i was able to tune in to my ipod ,  it wasn't crystal clear .  in fact ,  it wasn't even plastic clear .  the static sometimes overrode the music ,  which drove me nuts .  this is like a fax machine - the original may be spotless ,  but the fax will be a little fuzzy .if you have a cassette player in your car ,  there are adapters that go through the cassette player and are much better .  if your car isn't ipod compatible and you don't have a cassette player ,  you're better off just burning a bunch of cd's
don't buy this product .  there ,  simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these .  with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase .  since it was 30 days outside the warrantly ,  apple support told me  " sorry ,  tough luck .  "  i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again .  wrong !second ipod just died  ( same battery problem )  - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and ,  of course ,  by the time i got in i was past the 12 month warranty period  ( who keeps track of the purchase date ?  i sure didn't )  .other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product .  i'm just sorry that it didn't last  ( twice !  )  cause otherwise i'd be a fan
this is the third palm pda i have owned .   i bought the e2 directly from palm after my previous palm died .  it simply quit shortly after the warranty expired .  telephone support is poor and expensive .   after research this is a common problem .my employer pays for pda's for executives and since i approve of all of these products ,  i will hereafter not allow any purchase of any palm product based on falty products ,  poor customer support and extremely poor customer support .
these ear buds are large and hard .  they have sharp edges and hurt my ears .  i have large ears and large ear canals and wear other earbud type headphones all the time which do not bother me .  these were not only painful but did not enhance the sound ,  but actually reduced it .  this product should be taken off the market
the tomtom navigator is a nice enough device ,  until you get to the maps activation .  the maps activation ?  why should i have to activate my maps if i have paid for the product ?  good question ,  well ,  i activated these maps on one pda ,  and within 2 weeks my pda died and i had to obtain warranty service .  well ,  i decided that i would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when i got it back from the manufacturers  ( i tend to switch my pda every 3-4 months anyway )  .so i installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate .  ok ,  i figure .  .  . no problem ,  i will be able to activate it 1 .  .  . 2 .  .  . 3 because after all ,  only i have the activation card/code .  no such luck ,  tomtom wants proof that i have brought a new device ?  what kind of nonsense is that ?  what if i lost my pda in 2-3 months ?  what if i'm a nut who likes to change pda's every 3-4 months ?  what ,  you mean i have to show you proof that i switched ?  isn't the fact that i have the activation card proof enough ?  i don't know too many people who pay $269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes .avoid them at all costs .  you will regret your purchase if you change devices frequently .one other problem with this product .  .  . out of the box it is not 100% compatible with windows mobile 5 devices  ( most of the new axims are wm5 .  you really have to break your back to install on these devices .avoid
i don't like it because it is always saying  " low power "  and i do every thing it said to trouble shoot the problem with out and luck fixing the problem
this mouse was barely functional .   it did move the arrow across the screen ,  but it was in a very random fashion .   i went to the macally website and downloaded the latest drivers .   still no luck .   i'm sending this back .   guess i'll have to stick with my reliable kensington .  too bad it's so ugly and doesn't match my ice keyboard .   oh well .  .  .  function over form
i have tried these dvdrs with the burner i bought from amazon and  they do not work ,  i will try them again and send an email to you .   i bought a few imation to try in the burner to ensure it wasnt faulty and they worked !  !  !  what is up with these dvds ?
i have bought several of these .  some came in a fancy blister ,  and others in a coushing bag .  stay away from those .  be sure you're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different .i give the generic two stars just because it works .  i give four stars to the original because as others reviewers have said it's a little difficult to remove the card
i have many linksys devices and this is by far the worst one .  i love linksys stuff ,  which is why eveything that i own involving networking is linksis .  but this thing is a piece of crap and now i cant recover the 60 gigs of personal pictures that were on my hardrive because of this things format .  spend a little more money and get a dedicated network attached storage hard drive
i have used these labels for a long time ,  mostly because they seem to be the only ones out there .  the paperstock is good ,  but if you have a good printer the paper won't do it justice .  the labels always end up looking kinda cheap .   i would love to see memorex make a package with glossy  paper/high end paper .  maybe epson will beat them to it
i bought this machine on august 3 ,  2005 and within one week of using it  ( as an outgoing fax only )  ,  there was a machine error .   i called customer service and after being on hold for 23 minutes i was able to speak with a live representative .   i was told that the machine would need to be replaced .   they sent me a refurbished unit  ( the warranty indicates that any replacement units will be refurbished units )  .   they sent the base unit only ,  so i had to remove the drum unit ,  paper tray ,  and handset from the original fax machine to use with the replacement unit .   so ,  after only a couple of hours of using the replacement unit ,  i was back on hold to report another machine error .   12 minutes and i finally get a rep .   apparently ,  the drum unit  ( which is less than one month old )  is bad .   so now i'm waiting for the replacement drum unit .   don't ever buy a brother machine .   they're horrible machines and trying to get through to customer service is very ,  very time consuming
this is my first amazon review of any type .   i was quite happy to finally get a wireless keyboard and mouse .   when this was pulled from the box the finish was splotchy .   it looks like someone painted the keys in a garage .   i expected better .   now i have used it for a couple of weeks in an office environment ,  and already one of the plastic keyboard legs has broken .   i am not hard on the equipment and don't know how it happened .once in a while i press keys and nothing happens .   i can live with that .on the other hand ,  the mouse works as expected .before you purchase one ,  check the process for returning it !   i would rather put up with the crappy keyboard .  .  .  .  .i will continue to purchase many books from amazon but my computer hardware will come from dell .
got it home and it had poor focus .  the center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus .  the next morning the focus problem was gone .  go figure .  the big problem for me was the time it took to  change channels .  a full 3 seconds .  went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs .  well i took it back and went to walmart and got a sanyo ht27546 for $270 .  good set with quick channel change .  it also has an optical digital outputwhich the toshiba did not .  the sanyo also has a full one year warrenty .  sound on both tvs is fine .  a small point .  the toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit mute
i was using this power cord in conjunction w/ the belkin fm transmitter during a recent 4 hour car ride .  when i unplugged the ipod ,  it was incredibly hot ,  and now it does not work  ( i get the folder w/ the exclamation point on the display )  .  i tried to restore the ipod ,  but it is toast
basically a nice phone ,  but :a :  i've had three of these phones ,  and sooner or later the little repositionable hang-up tab snaps off ,  rendering it useless as a wall-mount ,  andb : i can hear well with the speaker phone ,  but have to shout to be heard .
i was using it as a backup device and it failed after about 12 months .  so i am ripping it apart and putting in a new ultraata disk in .  just hope the box is not frying the disk .i noticed in another review they had a western digital .  i had a segate baracuda 7200 . 8 .  doubt that it makes any difference .  i am sure it is just low bidder
i have the canon rebel .   i had the same problem where files were corrupted .   also ,  when clearing the card ,  some pics stayed filed .   i am not happy with this flashcard at all .
my first gps .  it was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features  ( ability to save many tracks )  .  the software is very us-centric .it worked very well on the flat and in unwooded conditions .  however don't use one of these things to navigate in the bush  ( use a compass )  .  the technology is just not there to cope with either valleys or an overhead canopy .  it was handy to confrm where i was when i found a clearing on top of a hill .  finally although the battery life is better than most it is still abysmal .in summary these things are still a toy for a tramper rather than an essential tool
i bought this unit to use with a boombox and it functioned well but after a few minutes it just went blank .  i tried batteries in the boombox ,  ac power and two boomboxes because they thought the boombox was the problembut after two boomboxes i guess the problem is the roady .anyone else have this problem ?i use the xm only at home with the boombox .currently waiting for response from crutchfield and delphi .i will post again when  ( if )  this is resolved .
used this unit for a few weeks and returned .annoyances :sofware :  with adf scanning ,  you have to enter scan parameters  ( paper size etc )  again for every scan and it does not have an option to let you to continue scanning more pages then adf can hold .  you will have to use  " add to file "  function and select all scan parameters again .  there is no option to scan double-sided pages as well with using 2 pass scanning .  so 3rd party software is definitively needed to get a real value out of adf scanning .color scanning :  while b/w scans are fast ,  color scanning speed is very poor to me .  scanning stack of color pages could take ages .  slow color scanning speed was observed in both usb and network modes .fax :  number of rings before fax answers is limited to 4 and i found no way to increase that .  no good for soho
we have bought 3 of these vtech phones for our house .  since the begining we have had battery problems .  it is really annoying when you have to make a phone call and your phone doesn't work because of the battery .at any point in time ,  at least one of the phones constantly reports a  " low charge "  or  " no battery "  message ,  which means you can't use that phone .  of course ,  you can hear the ring from the phone that is never at the same room that you are ,  so you have to run to pick up the other phone ,  since the one in your location has the no battery problem .as other reviewers have noted ,  this in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time .on the beginning we used to take the battery out of phone and put it back in .  that doesn't quite work anymore .  i tried to get support but you can't get a live person at the vtech number .  on their website they suggest replacing the batteries ,  but they are rechargeable ,  so how many times are we really supposed to buy new rechargeable baterries  ( i have already replaced it once )  ?i know we wont buy vtech products again .
after two weeks of use ,  i returned the mouse because 3 out of 4 times i tried to make a right click ,  it would not work .  i eventually got frustrated and decided to return it .i'm sure it has to do with the way i use the mouse but i'm not planning on changing my angle or whatever it is that makes it fail .  i think a regular 2 button mouse is just perfect .i wish this mouse had a real mechanical right button because it would be perfect .i loved the scroll wheel and will miss it greatly
after reading the detailed reports here for how to setup this linksys gaming adapter unit ,  everything worked great for several days .  i setup the fixed ips ,  and all the rest of the settings through the web interface ,  all seemed well .note :  i'm a network engineer ,  so the dual-fixed-ip recommendation  [ one for each segment ]  is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances .  i suspect the ms game adapter simply performs the dhcp handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup .then the weird stuff started .after having had this unit turned on for several days ,  i notice the connection would become slow and not quite as fast as when the linksys is first turned on .  yet ,  the xbox still shows the signal between 48 and 54 mbps .  strange .i have reproduced this several times ,  booting the linksys device ,  then playing all kinds of games online for hours ,  running xbmc and playing media through the network perfectly .  all is good for several hours ,  but come back the next day after leaving the linksys on all day/night ,  turn on the xbox ,  and the network connection is spotty again ,  but the link details show a full speed connection in the xbox wireless interface details .a swift power cycle of the linksys unit solves the problem immediately ,  but why should i need to do this ?  i suspect some nic buffer is being filled on the linksys and the power cycle clears out the unit's network buffers .if anyone has figured out what settings to use to keep this thing stable ,  i am ready to listen ,  maybe i should select a g-only network and set the speed at 54 or 48 fixed ,  maybe that will work ?anyway ,  i am getting tired of power cycling this thing every day .good luck ,f .
i first isntalled this to winxp 2nd ed and all of a sudden i am getting blue screens and the system keeps rebooting over and over .   i uninstall and the problem goes away .   coincidence ?   i will let you decide .   i reinstalled the adaptor and it gets very very hot .  .   reminds me of my notebook that overheats and shuts down .   i cant get a connection to my router .   i have my notebook im typing on now connected right next to the adaptor desktop and get a signal just fine with my notebook .   i will be sending this back
i bought one of these .   it worked ok about three months and then just quit .   i do not recommend for anyone else
i just purchased yesterday the home dock deluxe for list price at a local retailer .   i read all the reviews ,   ( most of them bad but i got it anyway )  the menu on tv part being my motivation .   and so far ,  i am not feeling good about buying it .  .  .1 . 	the sound quality is very poor .   almost every song has some distortion and sounds  " muffled "  along with a good hiss .   i thought i was listening to a 70's era cassette it was so bad !   i have a high end sony/infinity system and the poor sound is very noticeable .   in desperation  ( and checking to make sure my amp was working fine )  i plugged in my apple dock from my 4th gen photo 60gb and the standard apple av cable .   the sound problem disappeared ,  and was crystal clear .2 . 	the menus to not work properly .   my nano 5gb seems to work ok ,  but my 60gb 4th gen photo does not .   the menus are rather slow ,  and the artist ,  or album ,  or song titles disappear at random .   sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data ,  but mostly it is just blank .   the cursor will scroll down as though there is data there ,  but nothing shows on the screen .   you can play the music from the blank screen ,  but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you cannot see any titles .   i like the idea ,  but very ,  very frustrating .3 . 	there is no support at all from the dlo website .  it just lets me download a pdf of the manual or to buy more accessories .   i did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems .    i am not impressed .4 . 	there also all the other problems listed elsewhere ,  too light and build quality poor ,  annoying power led on front ,  no artwork on tv menu etc .  .  .5 . 	so basically ,  it is way too expensive .   not worth it .   not even worth 10% of the price charged .i should have listened to all the comments above ,  and not believed some of the  " official "  reviews on the web .   so it is back in the box and ready for a trip back to the store .   i guess my lesson is that i should trust the reviews
if your cars dash is curved or sloping ,  this mount will not work .  did not work on a 1988 mercedes 300e or a daewoo lanos .  it might work if you have a perfectly flat dash .  i had to return the item as it did not sit properly .  even the slightest touch from a finger would make it slide down .  those of you who are clean freaks like me ,  beware .  products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand !  i would not trust a $800 piece of equipment on an unreliable stand like this when even a slight touch of a finger can make it slide down .  what about jolts and bumps while normal driving ?  i did not wait to find out using my $800 gps as an experiment
.  .  . while this device does power your usb cable it seems to fail charging my blackberry or my ipod .  maybe the 400 ma is not enough for that .  i would not suggest to buy this item for these devices .  for the ipod you better get the usb charger from the apple store for 25$ that even comes with a standard ipod cable
i initially chose this router because of its low price .  sometimes ,  you get what you pay for ,  and that is exactly what happened to me .  as a wired router ,  this works well enough .  it connects four computers to the internet .  just don't do anything to intense with it ,  and you should be fine .  i noticed that when i view video media ,  the connection totally freezes .  but for basic internet and downloading ,  it works .i generally find ,  however ,  that no one buys a  " wireless "  router not to use wireless ,  and that is where the problem is .  the receiver is so painfully finicky ,  it does not keep connections .  the configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery .  the linksys support team tries to be helpful ,  but i can't seem to make this router reliable .  it drops reception all the time .  many times my laptop won't even detect a signal .  the wireless performance of this router is abysmal .i sincerely hope that if you have this router ,  it is working flawlessly for you .  i can't get it to work well for me not matter what i do .  the difficulty that i am having with this equipment is so bad that i am going to replace it as soon as i can .
this would be a great phone if it worked all the time .   i had to return the phone within 1 day because the handset was defective .   amazon was very helpful and prompt with a response .   however the handset would periodically quit working and required that the batteries be removed and reinserted to make it operational .   after 2 months the handset died completely .   at&t will replace the handset under warranty ,  but it could take up to 3 weeks to get the replacement
i am disgusted to realize that although crucial markets this card as coming with a driver for win98se ,  it does not .   the cd it came with did not have a driver  ( although it said it did )  the web sight does not have drivers and after two promises on the phone from crucial tech support promising to send me one ,  i still don't have it .   i don't believe this driver exists .  so much for truth in advertising and american company integrity
i use the pink circles to buff the cd/dvd ,  and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd ,  as i thought it would .  well ,  i thought that those marks would disappear after i used the repair paste with the yellow circles ,  but they're still there .  is it supposed to be like this ?  the reason i bought the thing was to make the cds look like new ,  but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over .could someone answer this question for me please
i knew these were inexpensive cd cases ,  but i can't even open one without it breaking into two pieces .  .
this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made .  it felt very light and flimsy ,  the definition of cheap plastic .  not just the construction but the performance was terrible .  it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes .  this was very very frustrating .  maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one ,  but i wouldn't take that chance again .i wish i could give this device a worse rating ,  somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate .
i bought this unit over a year ago and still haven't figured out how to work it .  i have used the d-link wireless router with no trouble ,  but no matter what i do ,  i can't get the print server to work properly .  this is after hours with their customer service people and doing everytihing possible .  based on other people's reviews this unit actually does work .  it just hasn't for me .
to anyone who may like these ,  i am sorry to learn about your hearing disability .  the t33 looked like a nice little package ,  but i thought ,   " how could it possibly sound even acceptable ?  "  i hoped for a sony surprise ,  but it didn't happen .  when i returned them later that day ,  the clerk asked ," is there anything wrong with them ?  "  i said ,   " yeah ,  they suck "  .she smiled and handed me a refund .
i've never had a product  [  .  .  .  ]  out after one week of use .  the screen froze up and no matter what troubleshooting tip i tried from the creative website ,  nothing worked .  now i'm waiting to hear back from email support because they don't have 24 hour phone support .  not impressed .  would have gotten an ipod ,  but this thing was given as a gift
this is a nice 4 line phone ,  but the digital answering system does not work .  we have 2 984's and several other brand 4-line phones .  i could not find any way to make either 984 work as a four line answering system .  auto-attendent is useless in our situation .  these phones are certainly not worth the money .  unfortunately there aren't many 4-line phones on the market and apparently no 4-line digital answering systems
i had this in my computer for a month ,  with a satellite radio on the audio-in and speakers on the line out .   it started crackling and the audio was distorted after a few weeks .   i took the sb out and went back to the motherboard onboard audio and it worked fine .conclusion = sound blaster suck
after using this sd card only twice ,  it can not be recognized by any of my card reader .  totally a waste of money and time .  do not buy pny brand
i bought this tv for my husband to take hunting but we can't get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture .    the tv is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen .   i didn't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we don't have cable .   i tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other .   i tried programming with the antenna on the tv and with separate rabbit ears .    it would only pick up one of the three local network stations .   it picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which aren't popular .    i couldn't get a good picture on any of the stations and i tried adjusting all the menu items ,  brightness ,  hue ,  etc .   it didn't even have a good black and white picture  .  .  .  .  it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back .    sooooo ,  sooo disappointed because i wanted to be able to use this at work too .
after having an experience with slow startup speeds  ( and actually freezing a computer )  with the 1gb cruzer micro with u3 ,  i feel compelled to write this negative review .  the mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives :  a fast and higlhly compatible interface .  any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability .  i work at an educational institution wher i am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive .  as a matter of policy ,  we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background
i purchased a biopod in march of 2006 .  received brand new unit that included omnipass software version 2 . 09 .  this software version released in 2004 .contacted company that produced the software and they refused to upgrade to their latest version  ( v4 )  that had been released a month earlier unless they charged me the upgrade fee .the version of software that comes with the biopod  ( v2 . 09 )  pretty much only works with internet explorer and other microsoft software .  the new version  ( 4 )  supposedly works with firefox and several other non-microsoft software programs .i recommend you avoid this product due to old software .  i returned mine and am ordering the ibm fingerprint reader
my brand-new card failed the first time i tried to download pictures from it ;  i lost all of the pictures from my two-week trip to guatemala
it's partly my fault ,  of course .  i bought this to use on my motorcycle .  i thought the small size ,  especially the flat body ,  would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag .  i also bought a special handlebar mount for it .  unfortunately ,  i've had nothing but trouble with it .  it's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes .  whether you're driving a car or a motorcycle ,  it's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route .  maybe it was intended for pedestrians only .  the user interface for the gps is not intuitive  ( at least ,  not for me )  ,  worse still ,  it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes .  the garmin helpline in the uk could only tell me to reset the machine each time .  not very helpful .  my guess is that the combination of palm pc and gps was too much for garmin to handle .  they should probably just stick to gps .
i bought two of these cards to go alongside my wrt54gs .  i though that they should work great together since they are from the same manufacturer .  oh boy was i wrong .even the though i get full bars with these cards ,  i get very flaky connections with them .  i've tried many different settings and firmwares to try to rectify the problem .  many hours have been spent trying to get a stable connection .  no dice ,  very flaky .other computers with different cards work fine with the wrt54gs and never dropout .  so there is something about this card that just isn't right ,  and i can't imagine both cards being defective .  i haven't tested them with another router ,  but if it can't work with a wrt54gs v3 ,  then what's the point
ive had this unit for over a 1+ year and ran into problems with reception it would drop signal and it would eventual come back .   i found out that this unit had a defect and the xm rep said i could get a replacement for $50 !  !  !   they didnt figure to tell anybody about this ?   if this is true i would not recommend xm radio at all .thanks john
if you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet ,  your unit will not be covered by the aps warranty on this device .  lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried .  the cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with aps .  they denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage  ( even though the modem wasn't hurt ?  )
-small button size-recording time is crap when used with the best batteries-hold button ,  many bugs with-bugs ;  files often end corrupt in various ways ,  meaning you get f***ed over-software is crap ,  also it cant convert to mp3 ,  o and did i mention you have to convert in general not true for all ic recorders ,  which others record directly in mp3 for example-mic is without noice reduction-device is the most fragile ic recorder ever-a consumer grade product ,  not a professional grade productgo with the following :  ds-2200 made by olympus ,  it smokes this ic recorder by a mile ,  and its tough and goes for about the same price perhaps cheaper .
i bought this to use in hotels .   this thing sucks .   i barely got it to work in my house .   too slow to set up .   based on the size of this thing ,  just bring a longer eithernet cord .   i am really disapointed .
i recently bought this keyboard to go along with a fancy ergonomic laptop stand .   the stand puts the laptop screen at a reasonable height for use on a desktop -- that works great .   the keyboard ,  however ,  is fairly awful ,  and i'm returning it .i realize i shouldn't expect much for $20 ,  but the keyboard has an exceptionally soft ,  mushy feeling .   the  " comfort type "  slanted keys didn't get in my way ,  but they didn't help anything ,  either .   the worst part about this keyboard ,  however ,  was that it uses a non-standard layout .   look closely at the right side -- the  " enter "  key is oversized ,  and the |\ key is moved below to accomodate it ,  with the consequence that the right shift key is miniaturized .this ,  for a shell user or programmer ,  is awful .   when you need to pipe something ,  or escape the next character ,  you really don't mean to be hitting return instead .   and with the small right shift key ,  even typing properly with balanced use of the keyboard is difficult .   this small design decision makes this keyboard terrible for heavy computer users like me
ipods are the leading sellers of portable players and everybody knows that but guess what ipod does not support the leading and best quality video format divx and avi hmm thats kinda retarded no ?  if any of you out there use file sharing programs such as limewire or any torrent programs if u download any of those videos the best ones and the majority are divx and avi too bad for you unless ur willing to sit around for an hour or two and convert your video to mpeg4 .  also the video you convert may have a few complications ,  the audio and video may not be sychronized .  .  . at all and for those of you who have already purchased this piece of garbage im sorry and i have great sympathy for you so if ud like a program that will convert ur video for free and results in pretty good quality go to download . com and search for jodix video converter .  this is not from speculations i have experienced this all myself with my own purchase of the video ipod and was a decision i regreted .  suggestion check out the creative zen vision m sure it may be thicker but the price is amazing for its features and conveniences of transfering files into it
may be i got a defective one .there is nothing inside to hold the ipaq .  its just a 3 fold cover .  ipaq comes with a much better case when you buy it new
yes ,  i burned them in for at least 25 hours .  they sounded muddy .  smooth as caramel ,  but veiled .  the bass was heavy and indistinct .  the high frequencies were not clean ,  and not abundant .having listened to stax headphones for years and years ,  i know i got used to a superclean ,  almost clinical sound .  but still i cannot believe how completely different the hd600s were .i borrowed these from a friend ,  who bought them new and had hardly used them .  frankly ,  i get more pleasure listening with my sony mdr-w20g sports headphones that i bought for less than $10 .    i am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews .  i would love to hear a headphone that sounds as wonderful as people are describing .  but the one i heard did not .  not even after break-in .   never would i consider one of these phones without auditioning them .  perhaps i truly heard a rare ,  defective unit .  but if so ,  both drivers were defective ,  because they sounded the same .
i bought this thing becuase i use voice recognition with my computer and i'm on the phone quite a bit .  it was supposed to eliminate the need to for two head sets .   with the amplifier and the plantronics headset to go with it the total cost came to around $200 .  yay !the amplifier has a strong hum when used through the phone and when i use it witht eh computer it has such poor sound quality that it doesn't work with my voice rec .  software .  i called customer service and they said i should send the unit to them and they would send me a new one .  funny ,   i have read that in a few places online .i went out and bought the labtec equivelent ,  the dialog-301 at a whopping $15  ( headset included ,  the head set is cheap though )  and it is chrystal clear for both the phone and my computer .  plus if you want to upgrade the head set you can buy any analog computer headset .save yourself $185 and just buy the dialog-301 you will be happy .
it is a great idea ,  with a few qualifiers .i have found that the forward and reverse buttons don't function for my video ipod or for my niece's nano  ( maybe it would for a non-apple mp3 player ?  )  .   i have to pair the device to the ipod every time i turn it on .   the bluetooth transponder will drain the ipod's battery even though it has it's own battery .   sound quality is decent .
this portable color tv doesn't give me any channel that you can actually watch .  i returned it and i was credited .  however ,  much to my surprise i received the same five inch tv as i had returned .  it already cost me to have it returned .  since i didn't ask for it ,  should i consider it a gift
i have a voip setup with voicepulse .   this phone works great as long as i don't assign phone numbers to the presets .  when i do it stops ringing after a few days .   the lights flash indicating an incoming call and i can answer the phone if i notice the lights flashing but it doesn't ring .  if i reset the phone to defaults ,  erasing all presets ,  then it works ok .    i got a new one from at&t and it does the same thing .   i love the headset button to switch between speaker and headset .  let me know if you know a workaround
this lexar brand has had issues with it's memory cards .   i lost lots of pictures from a vacation to disney world and a convention .  their site had software that was to help recover some of those lost images !  !   i have never had flash memory trouble until lexar !   i now only buy scandisk items .  samsung invented this tecnology and sd is their product .  the store i bought the lexar chip was in a hurry to give me another chip i could trust .  he gave me the higher costing sd chip .  i wasn't the first to have issues from buying it in his store .  he took a $50 . 00 loss to make me happy .  people take lots of photos now that we went digital .  imagine looking for some pictures you know you took and they are not there !   most think they messed up .  with this chip you will have that happen so pay very close attention .  most of what is lost can not be recovered .  pay the extra money for scandisk .
i bought this since it's economical ,  compact ,  didn't need cabling  ( although it has an extension if you need it )  ,  advertised a whopping 108 mbps .  well so much for that :1 )  drivers are problematic and causes conflicts with xp sp2 .   my first ever blue screen of death in about 3 or more years running xp came this item2 )  it is extremely unreliable :- already mentioned repeatedly ,  it overheats- it drops connections randomly and yes ,  the only way to re-acquire the signal is to unplug and plug back in- it's utility is worthless ,  just install the driver  ( if you can )  .  if you try using wpa ,  forget about using this utility ,  just use windows to configure it .- i've also found out that it's better if you just remove this utility from the startup  ( don't run it at all )  so that windows can do everything it needs to connect ,  which is faster and more reliable .  be careful not to uninstall ,  since it will also remove the driver .  .  . just remove it from your windows startup folder list .  netgear has an faq about this problem ,  but i'm not going to tweak windows and risk more stuff for this cheap piece of hardware .3 )  108 mbps ?  yeah right .  you'll need the right kind of access point/wireless router for this ,  if not ,  it's 54 mbps .  this was one of the selling points ,  but it's definitely a  " gotcha "  .  you're limited to specfic equipment ,  specific channel  ( 6 )  ,  so if you have neighbors on the same channel ,  well ,  you get the picture
i can use it for about 5 working days and ka-put !    ( even though i switch it off when i'm not using it .  )   there is no intelligible low battery indication or warning either .   also when i changed batteries ,  the battery contacts fell out .   poor quality
i bought one of these ,  it has a bad audio  " crackling "  noise on every mode except fm tuner  ( an obvious defect )  .  sounds like a capacitor going bad ,  not sure how it got through final test .plus ,  the audio has noise when the display updates or the volume is changed .  it also hangs on to stereo mode on weak signals with no blend or rolloff ,  you hear audio tones from the stereo decoder pll losing lock from the station 19 khz pilot tone .   am section is not bad ,  but the fm selectivity is not good enough to block alternate stations that most of my other radios deal with just fine .   volume steps are so small it takes forever to change ,  needs a flippin' crank on the knob .don't buy this steaming turd .  .  .  .  . buy a no-name china box ,  then you can throw it away when it claps out without feeling like you got scammed .
i bought this phone for a work-at-home situation .   i then discovered that the maximum number of characters i could enter into  a speed dial entry  ( the number itself ,  not the name )  is 24 characters .   a telephone calling card number is 25 characters long ,  26 if you program a pause  ( a space ,  for this phone )  between the phone number and the card id/pin .   when i called polycom about it ,  i was told that not everyone uses calling cards .   funny .   i've been issued a calling card at every company for which i've worked  ( going back 25 years )  .   this is the only phone i've ever owned  ( well ,  since the 80's )  into which i could not program my calling cards .   pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss .on top of that ,  when i try and enter the calling card number and card id by hand ,  it never  " takes "  on the first try :  the network doesn't recognize the card id and pin the first time i enter them .   i have to do it twice  ( i've tried this a number of times ,  and it's consistent )  .for that matter ,  the sound quality ,  especially through the headset  ( also purchased from polycom )  is not that good .   of course ,  that could be because the headset jack is  " loose .  "   you can easily move the jack from side to side ,  which makes the sound quality even worse .i regret having made this purchase .   i'm going to scrap it and look for a new one from a different manufacturer .   the only reason i gave it one star is because the site interface here won't let me give it no stars
i tried it with 3 differnt usb sticks and i could sometiems successfully record a 3 minute songs ,  but most of the time it failed .  i tried to record with an ipod - no success and also with 2 different external usb harddrives .i'm very glad that amazon took this unit back .i would not recommend this unit .
it dies if you plug in any external usb disk drive or card reader .   d-link just doesn't know how to write device drivers that work well .   i've had problems with every d-link product i've ever bought
i have to admit ,  the price of this item got me .   it's now 40 bucks down the drain as it has failed to work completely .   it worked for about 8 months but was very fuzzy .   the quaility was that of an am radio station .   recently ,  it quit working altogether so now i am back in the market for one that will work
i canceled the order of velocity dvd-r disks since it took too long to deliver
i agree with the previous review .   this phone cord worked twice .   now ,  it only retracts about half way ,  and keeps getting worse .   i'm returning it for a refund .   don't waste your time with this
cowon aka iaudio have the worst customer service of any other major company i dealt with .  no phone support ,  they have an 800 number but when you call it they direct you to their website .  their website support gives you the option to submit a ticket or live chat .  i waited over an hour on their live chat before i get a message saying that live chat is not available at this time .  i submitted a ticket & guess how long before i heard a response .  & the response was  " ship the item back for a refund "  .  i also tried to download the latest firmware and the link was broken .  i heard a lot about how bad their customer service was ,  but when i tried it myself it was even worse
like another reviewer ,  i had the srf-h3 model ,  and loved them - comfortable ,  secure ,  decent sound ,  and *almost* indestructable .i was hoping these would be  " new and improved "  .  well ,  they are new .  .  .  i really do not like them .  the electronics/sound seem to be at least as good as the srf-h3 ,  which is fine ,  but the new design does not work for me at all ,  for 3 reasons .1 .  the bigger band that goes over the top of the head is almost square - flat on top ,  instead of curved ,  so the weight all rests right on the crown of my head .2 .  the smaller band ,  instead of keeping it secure ,  just loosens up rather than hanging on .3 .  the earpads ,  which were on wobbly stalks on the srf-h3 ,  to match the angle of the ears ,  are fixed on this model .  so they push more on the rear edges of my ears ,  and push the headphones forward .the quality of the electronics and sound don't do much good if the things are a pain to wear .  maybe they will work well for some head shapes ,  but not for mine .  bummer .  .  .  maybe i can find the old model somewhere .
we have had ours for almost a year - it still works great ,  but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light .   great for visibility of the clock when you need it ,  but unfortunately ,  even when it's on the lowest setting ,  it lights up our whole room !   my husband sleeps through it fine ,  but i need a dark room to fall asleep and i always have to throw a sweater or towel over it .   we finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio
wouldn't it be nice to know what eight types of media the device will handle
i will not be sending this item to my frail 85-year old mother in law to help her survive in hurricane alley on the west coast of florida .   it is virtually impossible to open the battery case cover to assemble the rechargeable battery connection for this radio .   most folks would buy this and store it until needed and so would not know in advance that they cannot access the battery compartment .   this is unacceptable design failure for something the red cross is touting as a household essential .when the company was contacted for assistance ,  they suggested inserting a butter knife in the hinge and forcing the cover open !  !   folks have already reported being injured in trying to force the cover open .i will be returning this one as soon as i can
i bought this product less than a year ago .  2 days ago ,  i locked my laptop and tried to unlock it .   but i couldn't .   it was somehow messed up and the combination did not work .   i had to cut it !  !  !   i don't know how it got messed up but i'm sure that it was not study enough to last long
of the various ipod cases i've tried i found this one to be the worst .   the click wheel cover is impractical and annoying and the screen cover falls out all too easily .   using plastic in rubber hinges was a bad idea which simply does not work well .   see my other reviews for better ipod protectors
i bought vonage service thinking that finally there is a company which will let me control everything from their web portal ,  and provide features that traditional phone companies do not .  good thing i kept my number with traditional phone company and got a second line with vonage .its voice quality was really bad ,  and cancelling it was a pain to say the least .  it took me 4 months to cancell it .  waiting forever on hold .  please read internet forums/blogs before you decide to  " save "  money
i really enjoyed my zen ,  when it worked .   the first one i ordered i had to return becuase it would only play every other song ,  and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and i would have to take out the battery to make it stop .   so ,  i exchanged it for a new one ,  and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again ,  it would freeze up ,  and would only play 5 seconds of every song .  what i liked about it ,  for the small amount of time i had it was the sound quality ,  the choice in colors ,  and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space .   i'm not sure i would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days .   now i have an iriver clix and have had no problems .   it has less storage but i don't care ,  it is easier to control and i haven't had problems with it
low volume  .  .  .  people can not hear me at the other end .  i therefore have to return it .i liked my siemens 8825 much much better .other complaints :1 .  no central office voice mail indicator2 .  all handsets display the same missed call messages ;  so the same missed call has to be handled 4 times .  a very stupiddesign .3 .  large heavy handset4 .  this is not a phone system .  it is a collection of phones .
it looked flashy and well-conceived on the web shopping sites that featured it ;  however ,  after setting up panasonic's kx-tg5576m ,  i'm underwhelmed .  .  .     first of all ,  even in this day and age ,  it's not mac-compatible  ( though the pansonic call center representative had assured me ,  after checking with her superior ,  that it indeed was .  )    so ,   i cannot comment on downloading ringtones ,  wallpapers ,  etc .     ( meanwhile ,  these mobile phone-like features were the main reason i wanted this particular cordless phone )  .secondly ,  the built in digital message recorder is of the lowest quality .    i was looking for an alternative to the monthly charge for voice mail through the phone company .     this isn't it .  if you prefer to record your own message in lieu of the generic built-in message options ,  your callers will here something sounding like a worn-out edison recording .    it struck me as odd that with the included audio cable ,  you can connect the handset to an audio device with a headphone jack ,  to record custom ring tones ,  with good quality results .   yet ,  to record a message for the digital answering machine ,  you need to speak into the dinky little microphone hole on the base unit ,  with the aforementioned low sound quality .finally ,  the battery life of the handset is rather short .   this is despite the  ( too )  low backlighting on the handset keypad .   oh ,  why no backlighting on the base unit ?
we had such high hopes for this product and sadly had to return it .   only 20 feet away from the base unit ,  the clarity was very ,  very poor .   we've owned many regular cordless phones of varying quality and price-points ,  yet the least expensive of these were better than this .  .  .   they just weren't waterproof .   it's a great concept if they could just make them work well .   sure wish we could find a good waterproof phone !  !
after purchasing the stylus ,  i immideatley noticed that the styli were far significantly lighter in weight than the factory included stylus for the tungsten t5 .   even worse ,  after a fatal exception and hard lock on the t5 ,  i noticed that these styli have no built-in pin to hit the reset button with
i have a dishnetwork 942 hdtv dvr system .  this antenna is designed for a much older system .  it doesn't fit the dish very easily and was difficult to secure .  i can't tell if it works because so far it just seems to be incompatible with my system
when i purchased this plan it was for a tv between $1000 and 1499 . 99 .new contract claims that my purchase had to be under $1000 so they will not honor it .  this means i do not have an extended warranty .i either want this warranty for the price that was agreed upon or a full refund .i'm happy i found out about this problem before i needed the warranty .
i agree with the previous review .   this phone cord worked twice .   now ,  it only retracts about half way ,  and keeps getting worse .   i'm returning it for a refund .   don't waste your time with this
i've had this camera replaced by linksys 4 times .  the first time ,  was due to the camera crashing on a weekly basis .  the second replacement worked fine until i upgraded my router and switched from wep to wpa .  after the switch the camera would not connect to the router ,  switching back to wep ,  of course worked .  linksys has replaced the camera 3 times for this issue ,  and with the last support call confirmed that there is a known problem with wpa encryption and this camera
it would be really great if amazon and other resellers did a better job outlining which accessories were compatible with which products .   this is stated as a cf type i card yet this does not work with a nikon coolpix 4300--another ,  more expensive kingston card ,  must be used
either i am idiot or this product is very poorly designed !  it takes forever to get it just right ,  so that it won't slip off and still it feels uncomfortable and not quite right .  now they have them in sorts of colors ,  don't buy it ,  you'll just get annoyed everytime you want to use it ,  like me .
we purchased this system less than two years ago .   it has seen light to moderate use .   several days ago ,  the speakers started intermittently cutting out .  this afternoon ,  the subwoofer popped several times--then caught fire !   fortunately ,  my son was able to extinguish the flames before much damage was done .   beware !  !  !  !
the microtrack will not hold a charge by itself or even operate very long when hooked up to an external  usb battery pack .  it just drains away under charge .  the concept for  this  a pretty good  ,  but the implementation woefully lacking almost to the point where i may not reliably recommend to others .
i wish i had read the reviews before buying this piece of junk .  as another reviewer says ,  u3 ruins it .  i have a mac so that feature is useless ,  but even worse it cannot be disabled .  everytime i plug in the drive i get this cheesy cd image cluttering up my desktop and i have to eject it ,  along with the drive icon ,  before the unit can be removed .  what clunky engineering .  i'll be returning this and scratching sandisk off my list of reliable companies .  i also agree with the reviewer who complained about the packaging .  it is impossible to open without tearing it apart ,  which is probably a strategy to reduce returns
the mouse pad is a great idea with superb support for the wrist .  unlike some customers ,  i did not detect any odors or problems with the materials use in the gel pad .   however ,  the mouse pad did not work with my logitech optical mouse .   great idea but poorly implemented .
these phones had so much static ,  you could not hear !  !  !   we ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use !
a short list of grievances :1 .  the earbuds don't fit well in the ear2 .  the retraction wheel is in the middle of the cord ,  so that if you're walking while listening to music ,  it bounces around and threatens to pull the buds out of your ears .3 .  the retraction wheel broke after a month ,  making these headphones no longer retractable .not worth the money you'll spend on shipping ,  let alone the cost of the headphones .  these headphones are garbage
bought 100 dvd blanks - so far every one a coaster .   never had this kind of problems with any type of discs .   tried different software and burn speeds but nothing good .   very disappointed - at least they were cheap  (  .  .  .  )  .
after seeing a wide range in the prices for hdmi cables ,  i did some research into why is it .  found out that these cables carry digital signals  ( 0's and 1's )  ,  so no matter what kind of fancy name you add before this cable ,  its basic purpose is simple like a cat5 cable .  then i went ahead and bought the cheaper ones which are working perfectly fine .  so ,  dont be fooled by the high price cables .  there is no special sheilding &%*p in them .  its all misleading marketing .  for this length of cable ,  i would pay maybe $5
i'll admit ,  i'm not the techno wizard some on this panel seem to be ,  but then again ,  i don't believe you should have to be to operate what should be something simple ,  like a handheld computer .in essence ,  the title of this review says it all .   almost $300 and several months later ,  i am unable to get this hunk of junk to even turn on .   let alone connect to a server .   all of these things were supposed to be fixed by a 'patch' that if someone can download from the hp website ,  i'd love to see it .   all downloads came back with an error message when i attempted to download .long story short ,  you'd be better off buying a laptop .   hp is not known for their handhelds ,  do not buy this product or anything similar to this from hp .   you will be sorry .
i purchased dvd express and it never worked .  i spent endless time with tech support .  the old story about ,   " it must be your computer .  "  did not fly either ,  my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads .  i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it .  same problems .  tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product .  they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones .  my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money .  ads also told me it would not work with ulead's movie factory 3 ,  some of the software it came bundled with ,  but that was uleads problem .  i should use cap wiz  (  their program  )  duh !  !  !  guess what ,  it did not work with their program either .  ulead said they had several complaints with ads's product .  their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work .  save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product !  p . s .  since ads doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade .  i don't think they want a product like that either .  the only reason i gave one star is .  .  .  .  . it was packed well .ju
i recently purchased a refurbished toshiba gigabeat f40 for about $150 .  quite a bargain for a 40-gig mp3 player .  however ,  upon reflection ,  i regret the purchase .the gigabeat hardware seems to be ok ,  with good sound quality etc .  the major failing is with the included software .  as other reviews have pointed out ,  the gigabeat will only play encrypted tracks .  the gigabeat is supplied with gigabeat room application software to provide the necessary encryption .  gigabeat room starts automatically when connected to the pc via the usb port .  from the time the gigabeat is connected till the gigabeat room application is displayed on the screen is 30 minutes .  if you switch from viewing the gigabeat file directory to the pc file directory ,  the application hangs .  if you try to update your track library ,  the application hangs .  i have yet to get  through a single operation from beginning to end without the program hanging .  every time the gigabeat room hangs ,  you have to restart the application ,  with yet another 30-minute wait to resume .  the file directory on the gigabeat is usually out of sync with what is actually present on the hard drive .  microsoft media player version 10 may also be used to synchronize the gigabeat .  i have a 35-gig library .  it took media player 18 hours to encrypt and copy all 8100 tracks to the gigabeat .  in short ,  be prepared for a maddening and time consuming experience with this player .  software that gives error messages such as  " the program is quitted "  and with such obvious fragility may have been expected in 1986 but is absolutely unreasonable in 2006 .in my estimation you would be much better off purchasing an mp3 player ,  even at greater cost ,  that can play mp3 files directly ,  with file maintenance provided by windows explorer and or media player .
i had this gps device for only 3 days and found it to be no better than mediocre .although at one point i was able to track 6 waas satellites and the display claimed accuracy to 17 feet ,  while driving along a straight road for 5 . 5 miles ,  it indicated that i was traveling approximately 350 feet to the side of the road .   on two occasions on this straight road ,  it said i actually crossed the road and traveled on the opposite side .i conducted a test by placing the unit where it would have an unobstructed view of the sky for 1 hour and leave it motionless .   the trip computer reported that it had moved nearly a quarter-mile during that hour .   i checked the accuracy at 15-minute intervals and it was constantly reporting accuracy between 12-24 feet .the base maps are crude and inaccurate - a major 4-lane road  ( hwy 7 )  in tacoma ,  wa stops at 38th street .   really ?  !  ?   if i drive down hwy 7 ,  it goes a couple of miles farther than the unit shows .while using the compass you must hold the unit level in order to obtain accurate readings - understandable .   there is even a little message that tells you to hold it level if you are off a little - nice .   i tried and tried to find  " level "  according to the unit and after about 3 or 4 minutes was able to determine where  " level "  was .   it was nowhere close to actual level .   now ,  if i am trying to navigate with the unit's compass while it is mounted to my bike ,  there is no way it is going to be level and accurate .at 5 . 3 ounces ,  it doesn't even pass off as a good paperweight .fortunately i was able to return it to the seller with no problems for a full refund  ( thank you rei !  )  .   i found out that wal-mart . com sells the unit for 50 bucks less than rei after i bought it though .recommendation :   if you need a paperweight ,  get a rock - if you need a gps ,  get a different one .
i had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the fvs338 .   the main reason is the speed .   i have a lab and we tested the max internet throughput of the fvs318's at 1 . 2mbps !   this is unacceptable .   oh yes ,  this is with the latest firmware .several calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem .   i contacted their legal deptartment the same day .   several promises were made on netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist i reinstall my os !i have successfully sued to get my money back .with all of my venting done ,  i would like to say that i am still a fan of the prosafe line and will continue to use it .   but netgear be warned ,  i will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported
i purchased the 1gb lexar card ,  and 5 hours after i started using it ,  i've got corrupted data that no amount of formating or data deletion will remedy .   given that i had already disceted the box into small pieces to send in for mail in rebates ,  i contacted lexar and sent it to them on a warrenty claim  [ cheaper then driving back to the retail location i purchased it at anyway ]  .i got it back yesterday ,  and it was suffering the same problem i sent it in for in the first place !their solution ,  they pay for the return shipping of card #2 ,  and swap it out for two 512mb cards .not happy .   but at least they are somewhat responsive to fixing the problem
the features ,  size ,  and design of this unit are what drew me in .  but after just a few uses ,  i quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive ,  but completely unusable package .  to start with ,  the unit is small - the smallest of its kind .  but the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace .  second ,  the unit has a built-in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed .  so ,  when it crashes ,  which it does frequently ,  there is no way to  " cold-boot "  the unit by removing the battery .  this is also a problem because it reduces the unit's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no ac power to recharge it .  then ,  what you have is a paperweight .  oh ,  and by the way ,  when you do have it plugged in to charge ,  the backlight is always on  ( even if the power is off )  .  so forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either .but ,  all of this aside ,  the firmware simply does not work .  it locks up incessantly and ,  with no way to reboot ,  you literally have to unplug it ,  wait for it to auto-power-off ,  and hope that you can start the machine up again .  and ,  to add insult to injury ,  the body is a cheap chinese-made piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones .overall ,  don't be taken in by the low price .  paying any amount of money is too much for a unit that doesn't work
my sangean dt200v pocket radio failed after 2 . 5 years of infrequent use .   i kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes .   it worked perfectly on the few occasions when i used it over the 2 . 5 year period ,  until yesterday .   the buttons ,  switches ,  and display still work perfectly ,  but only very faint white noise can be heard ,  whether via speaker or via earphone .   the volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control .   the batteries are new ,  and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries .
i do not recommend sennheiser's mx75 headphones .first ,  the good features :1 .  as with all sennheiser products ,  these earphones deliver first rate sound for its price range .2 .  the earphones are very comfortable and easy to fit properly using the included pads .3 .  once inserted in the ear ,  these earphones will not fall out due to vibration ,  movement or sweating .however ,  the cord has ugly problems :1 .  the cord is unusually stiff and consequently tends to be tough to manage .  this is especially true when the phones are first removed from the package ,  as the cord maintains a sort of corkscrew shape for quite some time .2 .  the cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone .  the result is annoying slack around the face and neck .3 .  the cord is the ugliest possible shade of green .all in all ,  should sennheiser offer a new product using the same earphones ,  but with conventional wiring ,  i'll be a buyer .  until then ,  i've given up on using these lime green annoyances
the absolutely worst headphones i have ever had .   trying the different sizes ,  the earplugs just don't want to stay in my ears  ( even standing still )  .   the headphones that come with the i-pod ,  and the earlier version of lanyard headphones were both much better .   the sound was fine ,  but not any better than the standard headphones .   a poor product .   i was very disappointed ,  as i have had good experiences in general with apple in the past
the product description for these speakers is misleading .  they do not plug directly into a dvd player or game console .  then ,  after buying the adapters and doing the initial setup ,  three of the five speakers did not work .  perhaps these speakers are a good solution for pcs ,  but that's not why we bought them ,  and we immediately sent them back
this card crashed my system with the blue screen of death after installation .   please be really careful with this one
please search for the thread on the linksys support forum titled  " befsr41 v4 intermittent drop of connection "  which goes on for 4 pages with no reply from linksys support ,  i'd post a url but that is against the review guidelines here at amazon .the only way to fix the problems that occur with this router is to buy a different model or better yet a different brand .   it appears that linksys doesn't really care about the issue .i returned this router after the second day of dealing with it's constant connection drops and bought a belkin instead .
the memorex dvd+r has got to be one of the worst dvd-r's out in the market .  not only is the rate of a successful dvd burn very low  ( movies ,  games ,  etc .  )  ,  it also has a horrible shelf life that lasts for about four months .  from what i hear from other members ,  memorex uses a low-quality dye ,  and is explicitly evident in the red colored deterioration of the dye that can be seen on the top layer of the disk .  all my dvd+r's are actually stained red for some reason ?  !  ?  overall ,  go with verbatim or heck ,  even compusa dvd's will be more suffice than this garbage
terrible product .   i have tried using the windows xp wireless application with just the netgear drivers and tried using the netgear wireless application with the netgear drivers .   using either one the card disconnects at random using wpa ,  then you have to repair the connection and sometimes reboot to get the connection back .   i reinstalled windows both times i changed drivers just to make sure nothing was conflicting with it ,  but nothing helped .   latest drivers are 2_0_0_7 and were published in nov 2004 ,  so netgear has moved on to other cards and is not supporting this one any longer
don't even accept it as a freebie  ( as i did )  unless you are prepared to pay $1 . 15 per sheet for color ink .   that was my experience with the first color cartridge ,  which was fully consumed on a total of 20 sheets ,  12 of which were heavy color ,  the others being mixed color and text or very light color .   at $17 . 99 per color cartridge and $14 . 99 for black i calculate the outrageous ,  obscene $1 . 15 per sheet figure for ink .   this is about six times greater than the average ink cost for my old hp720c ,  which unfortunately does not work with my new hp pavilion pc  ( no printer port on this model ,  among other issues )  .   i have vowed to not purchase any hp product in the future if i can possibly avoid it .   i just ordered a canon pixima to replace this ink hog .   on the positive side ,  the print quality is good ,  speed is excellent ,  and color fidelity is fair .   the software installed without incident ,  and the machine is easy to operate ,  but the hp software is overbearing and constantly trying to sell you something--worse than daytime television
it doesn't work properly .   i can charge the ipod but it doesn't let me sync .   sent an email to the seller but no answer so far !i am very disappointed with my purchase
do not get these headphones ,  as they are way too tight .  i have been using them for a month now ,  hoping they would break in more ,  but they have not .  you can only have them on for 20 minutes or so before your ears hurt so bad you have to take them .  im not sure why they made them so tight ,  but they would probably best fit a 10 year old .
i bought this and i'm sorry .   it sounds horrible .   don't waste your money because you'll just have to buy another one anyway for any true enjoyment .   this crap is barely good enough for my bathroom
i can't understand how apple sell so much ipod video while they are so bad in front of an archos .  just look at the screen and you'll understand  !archos is an hundred times better
this player worked for 2 months .  then all of sudden it started failing with  " no disk "  message .  please do not go for cheap players
i decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g .   i did this because the  " g "  card would randomly disconnect when the wep or wpa security was activated .   living in a home near about 6 other networks i really wanted the router and wireless network secured .   so ,  i purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem .   i can happily say it solved the random disconnect with wpa security turned on .   the range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid .   have not had a disconnect yet ,  over the last 5 hours .the reason i took away one star is the fact on the wireless network monitor v2 . 1 there seems to be a flaw .   when i connect to the network and internet the monitor says it is hooked to the network but unable to find the internet .   obvious by my submission of this review ,  the internet can be found and used .all in all a good product that functions just fine in my a45-s121 toshiba laptop .phil  ( mesa ,  az
you'd think that a palm screen protector from palm would be best in class .  however ,  these palm  " premium "  screen protectors have a lifespan of about 3-4 days at best .  i'm very careful with my new palm tx ,  yet under normal use the stylus easily scratches the screen protector to such an extent that the device no longer accurately recognizes stylus input .  i also dislike having to cut the screen protectors to size .  i've tried an invisible shield screen protector ,  and it was tough as nails ;  the problem was that installation was difficult ,  and the tacky surface also produced input errors .  next i'm trying a boxwave cleartouch .  i never had this sort of problem with the old fellowes writeright protector ,  which lasted a year or more on my old palm m130
when i got the moniter i said it was cool and alright but whe i plugged it in it did nat work and i was angry . i tried again but it did not work so i tried to send it back but it was to much of a hassle . i decided t see what was the problem and send it to a electronics store and the told me the the ic was bad . the only thing i could have done is to buy a new adapter . so i paid 800 trinidadian dollars to get it to work . i was furious
worked well for a while  (  2 weeks )   ,  the sound always had static ,  later the sound went really low and then it just died
i agree with the person who says there are no instructions and poor image quality .  i wonder if they gave us a mini jack like games systems use if it would work better on tvs that have the 3 jacks on the front .  games systems get good image quality so why is this so bad .  .  .  no info on this from monster .  looks like a very good product but i will return it unfortunately .  i did discover though that i can use a stereo jack with r-l on one end and a mini jack on the ibook end to give me audio speakers on any tv or stereo for my itunes ,  and audio for a dvd that i am playing but i don't need to spend this much money to get that .  if the image were good i would keep it .  i would rather show my slide shows from the computer .  the image was very bad .  .
the z-5450 has good points ,  reasonable cost ,  ease of use and ease of setup .  it has a major fault in a buzzing noise made when the unit is turned on .  give this item a pass ,  wait for the next generation and a guarantee that this problem has been corrected
i was on hold 50 minutes ,  52 seconds before anybody answered .   i heard  " your call is important to us "  at least 100 times ,  which wasn't very convincing
i agree with the previous review .   this phone cord worked twice .   now ,  it only retracts about half way ,  and keeps getting worse .   i'm returning it for a refund .   don't waste your time with this

dont microsoft ever send their software thru quality assurance checking ?  they asked me to install a windows update  ( kb something or the other )  saying that it prevented the software from running at 100% cpu usage .  lo and behold ,  it still gets stuck !  !  task manager dutifully reports that it is after all consuming all resources
for my powerbook - my first bluetooth mouse  ( a macally bt )  worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk .  so for the replacement i read the reviews and went with the kensington bluetooth mini - primarily for the on/off functionality .i like the size and shape ,  the on/off switch and the scroll works just keen .  however ,  tracking is a nightmare - especially when cpu usage is high  ( applications like photoshop ,  acrobat or using a vpn to access my work files )  .  i tried troubleshooting ,  adjusting the track rate ,  but nope .  the cursor continues to stutter across the screen with this mouse .i think i'm going to throw in the towel and go back to wired
i bought this to run ethernet into my daughter's room .   the powerline etherernet works flawlessly ,  i've had it up and running for six months without restart or problem into three other rooms .   the wireless module however tends to overheat and drops the network after 24-48 hours of operation ,  so she has to unplug it every time she is done with the network ,  and plugs it back in whenever she wants to connect .   i am going to upgrade her to another wired powerline ethernet module
a short review .  .  .don't buy this product .  the wire is too long and the remote control is too heavy for the jack to hold .  after a month of the remote and wire hanging and swinging about ,  the wire where it's connected at the jack gave out making this remote unuseable ;  i have to jiggle and find the sweet spot now just to make the remote work .long wires plus a remote adds considerable stress and weight on the jack .  .  . a serious design flaw .  if you want to buy this ,  i suggest you tie the wire and the remote using a rubber band around your ipod to support it's weight without pulling the wire off the connector
before you buy this drive ,  be sure to google  " cypress at2lp rc42 "  and  " western digital "  .until yesterday ,  i recommended this drive to everyone .  then my drive failed ,  prompting me for new hardware and to install a driver for cypress at2lp rc42 .  it appears that there is a chip in the drive housing manufactured by cypress that is failing in drives left and right .   ( class action suit anyone ?  )the western digital support staff is no help .  act like they have never heard of this error .  offer no option to just switch out the housing .  will replace drive- but you lose all the data .  there are $30 replacement housings available - but you void your warranty .bottom line - if you buy this drive ,  be prepared for it to fail .  keep everything backed up ,  because there will come a day that this drive will fail
the first thing i did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually was an apple product .   its really cheap looking .   looks like something you'd find for  [  .  .  .  ]  at a flea market or in the  " stocking stuffers "  section of the dollar store at christmas time .  the nano is small so almost anything will hold it ,  including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit .this looks more like the freebie armband that should come free with the unit .  certainly not a  [  .  .  .  ]  accessory .  it just cheapens the apple image .if oem apple products are your thing ,  then go ahead and try this .  but if you're looking for something as sweet as your nano that stays put while you workout ,  look for something else .   i'm returning mine this weekend to spend my money elsewhere .
no tricks ,  just treats and delivered on time as promised .
heres a new one .  .  .  . i have recently bought two spindles of these discs ,  and my computer  ( imac w/ intel chip-hardly outdated )  simply doesnt recognize them-like i never put in a disc at all .   the kicker is that this spring ,  i also ordered two spindles of these discs  ( exactly the same as far as i can tell )  ,  from which i burned one hundred discs  ( not a single faulty one !  )  for a freind overseas .   i have no idea what the deal is ,  but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs .   anyone got ideas ?
air purifiers were recently reveiwed by consumer reports magazine .  they are quite ineffective and can be dangerous to your health .  for further info ,  read article in consumer reports
i have wanted a crockpot for a long time and this one was one of the cheaper ones i saw .i've read reviews about rival before but decided to go ahead and try it out .i really wish i would have kept my receipt and box !  .the lid doesn't even fit and moves around most of the time making a bunch of noise and letting all the steam escape so all your liquid ends up being gone .the food is well done before the slow time is up .  my chicken turns out so dry and overcooked .
this mixer is so weak it couldn't mix air .  it's horribly under powered .  seriously ,  it bogs down mixing mashed potatoes ,  and i'm talking instant mashed potatoes !  and mix protein drinks ?  ?  forget about it .  it leaves clumps because it doesn't spin fast enough .  i'd do better twirling my finger in the glass .consider using a spoon over using this contraption ,  and $20 will buy a lot of spoons .  or get a real mixer and leave it somewhere handy - same convience but it will actually work .if you don't believe me and the others here warning you ,  go ahead and throw your money away on it ,  and then you'll wind up here adding your own warning to others .consider yourself warned
i only used mine once ,  then tossed it .  wish i would have read these reviews first !   thought it looked good at kohls .   i liked that the grates can be seperated to wash .  .  .  they do ,  but it takes a lot of force .   feels like you're going to break them .  i should have returned it but i was mad at it and trashed it .  .  at least it was marked 15% off  ( still higher than here though )  .i've been trying to find one like we have .  a simple one with a handle .   no plastic .  i feel they work the best .   i think it's an ecko ,  but i can't find it anywhere .   target and walmart don't have it
why does this light cost 30$ ?  for this price and supposedly a bunch of  " design awards "  ,  i find this light to be of extremely poor quality .  the connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension .  the chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on .  i am still looking for a better alternative ,  but for the price ,  this light isn't worth the investment .
to begin with .  .this pan heats up even and fast .  i have a hard anodized circulon non-stick pot ,  a copper bottom skillet ,  and this calphalon pan .  the heat distribution is excellent ,  and unlike the copper bottom pan ,  the calphalon is light and easy to use .but ,  the good stops here .  the stick problem is bad ,  and my stainless steel copper bottom pan sticks less than this calphalon skillet .since it's not a non-stick pan ,  some sticking is expected ,  but clean up is just pain .  regular soaking over nite will not help sometimes .if u cook vegitable and small amount of meat ,  this pan is good .  but never fry egg or cook steak in this pan .  avoid anything that will carmalize or contain high sugar .i once cooked some balsamic vinegar mushroom with brown sugar in this pan ,  and it took me forever to get it clean again since the sugar carmalization litterally stuck to the bottom .
the cuisinart egg cooker :- over/under cook the eggs according to its measuring cup- plastic tray deforms after it's heated  ( and stays deformed )- the metal cover burns your hand- is $10 more expensive than the krups 230-70 egg express egg cooker ,  which is a much better product than cuisinar
i was very unhappy with this product .   i ordered several cannisters and 3 out of 5 cracked after the first use !  !  !   i did everything that they recommended and they all cracked in the same manner .   the people at foodsaver were very happy to replace them because they are under  " warranty "  but i am surprised to see how fragile this product is .   fyi ,  they will not warranty the products sold on e-bay .   i should have listened to the reviews and not taken a chance on this product .
after getting the teakettle in january ,  i had to stop using it by june .   the kettle was leaking water all over the kitchen counter and at time it would not turn off by itself .   delongi sent me a new kettle to replace the one that was broke  but it was a model only worth $80 . 00 .   when i ask about the $50 . 00 difference in price of the two teakettles i was told they covered their warranty and i'm out of the $50 . 00 .  i won't be buying anymore of delongi products !
this machine is the only sub-$3000 machine i could find that would make a cappuccino with the push of one button .   however ,  after an hour of trying ,  i could not get the machine to do anything other than display a message saying the grind was too fine .   the delonghi service number blamed it on the plastic float in the water reservoir ,  the simplest and cheapest looking mechanism imaginable .   i was having second thoughts about their quality control for a machine whose all-plastic construction did not inspire confidence to begin with ,  when the service person ,  after conferring with a colleague ,  decided there could be something more seriously wrong with the machine and that i should  exchange it .   knowing that super automatics in general are not known for their reliability ,  i envisioned years of chronic problems with this machine .   i opted for a refund from amazon instead and am relieved i did
i use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco .   you need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to ,  wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half .   adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice .   it looks ok ,  but it just isn't the quality item you would expect with the name cuisinart .   the price is also reasonable ,  so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that don't require as much water or cook time  ( like white rice )
i bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle .  this implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design
this was the best toaster over i ever owned .   but one of the infrared bulbs blew after about 4 months .   does anyone know where to buy a replacement
i have depended on my french white - the  " old "  style - for many years .   i went to buy a few new pieces for myself ,  but discovered that corning has changed the design .    " french white "  is now nothing more than cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware .   i saw many chips and even a crack in the display models .   stupid corning !  they seem to have forgotten that corningware was designed to be the smart alternative to that cheap-cheesy-heavy-porous-breakable stoneware !   please save your $$$
product not even worth a penny .  impossible to use after the first wash .  . wont recommend to anyon
i have a dead knife .   this is a dangerous knife .   as i was cutting something the handle and knife broke .   i was only cutting cheese .   this should not happen with a good knife .   i loved it until it almost caused me major damage .   so be careful with this one
the tumbler that i have is sold in various places as the '360-degree dribble-proof tumbler' ,  i am not sure if that is the same as the jmt401 but on paper the specs and features are the same .   it is not a good design for car use .   on the plus side i like the no-handle design and it has a small base which should fit most cupholders .   on the down side you need 2 hands to twist the lid open or closed .   also the 'dribble-proof' design means that the mug has a very deep lip ,  and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing
this bowl does not work with the ice-45 ice machin
when i received my set of mini springform pans i was very excited .   i couldn't wait to get started on some wonderful deserts .   and as expected the results were great .      only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves .   not only did i notice rust on the release hinges ,  but the rims on the collars were warped .   at first i thought i could live with this ,  but a friend pointed out it could only get worse .      i am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment ,  but these definitely do not make the grade .   admitedly the results of my first time use were great ,  but i just don't feel these pans will last .      i hate buying something and knowing i will have to replace it soon .   and that is exactly the way i felt with these pans
this item was broken when it was received .   it was not packed properly
this thermometer never worked correctly .  for oven temps .  over 350 the probe is worthless ,  it reads the oven temp .  ,  not the temp .  of the meat .save your money and buy and old fashoined one
i bought three of these when i saw them in a local store ,  thinking them a great deal .  they look like the equivalent of the henckels ,  solid and sturdy ,  at one-fifth the price .  looks can be deceiving .  they are suitable for paper ,  skin ,  aluminum foil ,  etc .  ,  but do not try them on anything more substantial ,  like chicken leg bones .  i broke these on items that i routinely cut through with my henckels and wusthof shears .  the cost of sending them back under warranty was about the purchase cost ,  so i tossed out all three pairs .sorry ,  chicago cutlery ,  but if you are selling office scissors ,  label them that way .  i expect kitchen shears to be a lot tougher ,  so i can't mark these more than one star .  chicago cutlery makes a pair of scissors called the insignia series ,  for only about $2-3 more .  i suggest potential buyers look into these ,  or spring for the more expensive german brands
after me first coffeemaker began leaking- and it was a realtively new proctor-silex 12 cup maker- i decided to try one of these  " cute "  single serve ones .   why ,  oh why did i purchase this brand ?  ?   first ,  it does take around 3-4 minutes to brew a single cup of coffee or tea .   this seems like a longer time than most .   and now ,  after 2 or 3 frustrating weeks ,  it's leaking just like the old one did .   not user error ,  as the water comes from underneath the coffeemaker .   also ,  the coffee is not coming out as hot either ,  which causes me to wonder if it's the heating element .  .  .   even though this one can use loose grounds or pods ,  it is not worth the frustration !   try a different brand .   my sister-in-law has really enjoyed her sensao !
this has been used twice .   the first time i used it ,  it made a great smoothie .   i tried to use it this past independence day and the  " pulse "  stopped and started continuously .   after a while ,  something smelled like it was burning .   on the bottom ,  there appears to be lots of specks of metal .   don't think i'll be buying a new one
it has a terrible desing flaw .  i use it to mix and carry protein shakes .  i put the powder in ,  put the cap on and when i am ready put the milk or water ,  shake and drink .  too good to be rated 2 stars ,  isn't it ?  well that was the good .the bad is :  the tread that hold the cap is inside the conteiner so when you mix ,  the mixture go thru the tread  ( it doesn't look nice )  ,  and it's supposed to be hold in by a clear tiny silicon-like band that is attached to the cap .  if you tighten the cap too much ,  the band will be squeezed out of position and leak .  if you do not tighten it enough the band won't seal and leak .another thing ,  maybe not as important as the above ,  is that it is little uncomfortable to drink directly from the bottle ,  the lid keep closing everytime .so before you make your decision analize carefully .  despite all that .  .  .  .  it mixes ,  when you get it right ( until the band break )  and spray eventuall
i wish i had read the review by mary twain before purchasing the pro form rose bundt .   because it was made by nordic ware ,  i thought it would be the same as the cast aluminum but it's not .   don't be fooled b/c the cake will not look like a rose .   the pan is more shallow & the ring is bigger than the cast aluminum .   since i only paid $9 . 99 for this ,  i didn't want to waste paying for shipping to get a refund
i liked the mug's look ,  feel ,  & size .  then i took a drink of java from this mug .  .  .  i never could get a lip lock on this mug .  the rim is very thin & very wide .  it would always spill a couple of drops on my shirt .  nissan mugs have what i call a  " lip ledge "  that prevents the  " dribble "  effect to which the bodum is prone .  nissan mugs also have a much smaller diameter rim which also makes drinking from them less hazardous to my white shirts
bought this item last christmas for my wife .  worked fine until this thanksgiving when rubber bulb split apart when basting turkey .  she had complained when i bought this fancy one to replace her old ugly plastic one last year but i insisted this was better .  boy am i in trouble now .  old plastic one had lasted for 10 years and cost 1/10 as much .  did not look like much but it did the job
this breadmaker is not doing what i want .   it is so touchy ,  you have to be very very precise to be able to cook a reasonable bread loaf .  i am not satisfied with the product and will try to return it .   also it works very noisy during dough process .look for something else if you want a breadmaker
love those irobot products and everything they're capable of doing .   in fact ,  this was my third purchase ,  but my first remanufactured product .   what a headache !   the product worked correctly just three times ,  then died .  both technical support and customer service from irobot were helpful and prompt ,  but still took weeks to resolve the issues .  i tried a different way of recharging ,  which didn't work .   then they replaced the battery ,  but that still didn't solve the problem .   ultimately i had to send the product back ,  then waited more than a month for a replacement ,  which was on backorder .   finally ,  they substituted a different model ,  and which works just as advertised .   i'd never buy another remanufactured model .   but i still believe in irobot .
no postives to report .the unit is :1 . too small to make enough cheese to bother with .2 very difficult to clean .3 poorly designed ;  the cheese sits in the whey .4 . overpriced .  this should retail for under eight bucks .  four or five on sale .faster and easier to use cheese cloth than this device .
i have ordered and returned twice and my third one they sent has the same result .after a few uses it seems to twist off stroke and stays that way .
i've had this appliance since just before thanksgiving but only able to fully use it twice .it's very cool the way the egg poacher works with the muffin toaster .  but when i washed the egg poacher cup ,  a good bit of teflon came off .   ( i tried a second time and my poached egg was full of black teflon flakes .  )   the appliance came with a notice that implored you to please call the back to basics if there is a problem  ( rather than the retailer )  so i did .i was told they would send a replacement cup immediately .i can boil eggs in it which is great but you can't toast at the same time so either your toast or your eggs get cold while waiting for the other .as i approached my 30 day return period ,  i called back and was told that the cups were being redesigned and they would send one out immediately .today  ( now 64 days after the first call )  i called again and was told that my cup was mailed 10 days ago  ( but only 7 business days so they won't even discuss tracing or resending until next week )  .   they mailed it from utah .   i live in seattle .i am so not happy with their service ,  their attitude and now i'm even getting annoyed at the appliance .   hopefully ,  no one else will have this problem .   but ,  just in case .  .
firstly this set arrived with the small lid broken .   amazon of course sent a replacement set but then the large lid was broken on that one .   i now have my full set however it feels kind of thin and fragile .   it's an ok buy but when the time comes to replace them i'll be looking for something a bit more durable
i should have listened to the other reviewers ,  which i usually do .  i followed the directions to the letter .  put it on in 95+ degree weather and never felt cool at all .  in fact ,  after several minutes i actually felt hotter and was sweating as much as without this thing on .  even if it had worked ,  it was very uncomfortable .  i am suprised that sharper image sells such a bad product
i followed breakin instructions as written on pg 3 . the clear see-thru top warped . unit works , but is ugly .  i contacted salton and was told my unit was out of warranty , too old !  i mailed copies of my invoice .  no response . i gave up . i was very happy with your service , but wonder if driving to walmart might have been better .sincerely ,john c bennet
" warring "  has a high reputation for being a powerful blender .  i purchased because of its reputation .  but it turned out to be actually not that powerful and may not be as powerful as the one i had before which only costed $30 .  so i asked myself why bothered to replace it when the new one ,   " warring "  ,  in fact does not really break ice any better than the cheap ones .
i love the way the tefal deep fryer cooks ,  however ,  i am returning my second one due to a defective lid closure .   the lid may close initially ,  but after a few uses it no longer stays closed .   since i have small children in my home ,  i will not be purchasing this one again .
this toaster at the lowest setting of 1 burns my toast .   it also burned one side of a frozen bagel when i put it on defrost .further ,  when plugged in ,  the dial is lit up by a red light .   it makes me feel like the toaster is on ,  and needs to be turned off .   i have to keep reminding myself that it is okay .   if i can find the box ,  i'll probably return it .   maybe i just got a dud ,  since most reviews here are goo
we purchased this corkscrew as a gift for our daughter .   on her first attempt to use it at a holiday dinner party ,  we found that it required an unreasonable amount of strenghth to uncork a bottle of wine .after contacting amazon . com customer service ,  our entire $39 . 95 purchase price was refunded in the form of a gift certificate under their extended holiday gift return policy .recently our daughter had an opportunity to use a corkpuller of a similar design .   it removed a cork with far less effort .in summary ,  we offer a rating of 5 stars for our amazon . com buying experience and a rating of 1 star for the metrokane rabbit corkpuller .
i cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished roomba discovery 4210 .  while i think the product did a good job on bare floors  ( not carpet )  ,  now after only 4 months of light use  ( we only used in the kitchen/den area of our home )  ,  the unit is trashed .  the refurb warranty is only 90 days and that's apparently all the machine is good for .  i purchased a new aps fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out ,  but it did nothing .  this seems to be typical of this vacuum since the roomba rep i talked to told me that if the charger failed the roomba was  " probably trashed "  .  she was right .  if you want  to try this machine stick with the new one ,  at least you'll get a one year warranty .  but i recommend staying away altogether
i had slightly older edition of the krups crystal aroma for several years ,  until i lost one carafe too many - if you're careless ,  when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop .   but that's my fault .   the crystal aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water ,  but overall ,  the quality of the coffee it produces is merely ok .the reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that krups now makes a much better one .    " aroma control "  is a poor description for the recent line of krups coffeemakers by that name actually do .   the aroma control machines have a simple ,  but ingenious mechanism for retaining the coffee in the brewing chamber for an extra minute before letting it drip through into the carafe .   more than filters or an exotic shape that supposedly retains aromas ,  that extra minute of brewing makes all the difference in the world .   unless you're just in love with that round carafe ,  skip the  " crystal aroma "  and move on to the  " aroma control "  line .
i was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after i figured out how to make it work ,  loved it .  after a while the latch on the top broke off and i had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee .  that made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down .  it was a little inconvenient but i got use to it .  then the metal filter broke and i decided to get a new one .  luckily i put the old one in the garage for  " spare parts "  because not long after i started using the new one the side tab broke off and i had to grab a replacement off the old one .  i will probably not purchase this brand again
i purchased this egg cooker specifically for poaching 2 eggs .  i used large ,  farm-fresh eggs .  whatever combination of water and timing i tried ,  i never got a perfectly cooked poached egg .  the cuisinart instruction book is confusing in its layout - specifically page 5 .  i called cuisinart and after much back and forth ,  it was determined the eggs i used were too large and the directions were for medium-sized eggs .  if considering this machine ,  be aware you might have to sacrifice the eggs you want to eat .
i had bought this vacuum because of the good reviews .   i wanted a cordless vac to take care of the quick jobs -- not heavy cleaning -- but the primary job was to do to take care of daily kitty litter cleanup  ( rescued mother cat and 4 kittens )  .   it does a good job for lint and hair but doesn't work on kitty litter .   it spits it around or keeps in roller section .   i thought i was using it wrong and tried it every way -- but it only picks up a small percentage of the kitty litter and rest is just blown around or drops out when it's turned off .   i'm going to have to buy another cordless vaccum
i bought this juicer last week from a local store .  it is impossible to keep it steady when you use it .  you are lucky if you get the half of the juice in the glass !   the juice is all over the place .  the unit started to make a loud noise after 2 days .  i will return it this weekend and get my money back .  stay away !
the cooking set looks great .   however ,  once you heat the pot/ pan ,  the steel material handles become super hot .   i have to return the huge box
this product simply does not work .   the vacuum is so weak that it does not preserve the wine ,  even for a day .   i have used a vacuvin for many years and it is a far superior product at a far lower cost .   we bought this item because it appeared to be easier to pump than the vacuvin -- and it is .   the reason :   it doesn't preserve the wine .   i am seeking a return and refund ,  either through amazon or metrokane
this product is junk .   i like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed .   the hadle is spot welded and can not hold any weight .   my second one broke after shaking the remains of a stock out .   do not buy this product !  !  !
the glass is quite fragile .  i had two break
i placed two separate orders for this product and each order was received with one broken dish .   the set s not packaged correctly by the manufacture .   ended by buying a different produce else where
i had been looking for egg rings  ( without knowing what such a thing was actually called )  for a long time before i happened upon these babies .   as soon as i saw them i knew they were exactly what i had been looking for and ordered them on the spot .   unfortunately ,  my glee turned sour when i tried to use my new egg rings .a lot of people report they haven't had a problem with sticking ,  but that is not consistant with my experience .   eggs stick to virtually everything ,  and these rings are no exception .   trying to remove the ring and flip the egg is a pain ,  usually i flip the ring and the egg flips with it ,  and then i have to cut the egg away from the ring so it falls down to the pan
i was so excited at the prospect of having a 3-cup mini chopper .   i thought it would be ideal for hummus ,  which i hate to scrape out of my blender .   however ,  it was very disappointing .   on either speed ,  it just seems to chop what is in the center ,  so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped .   if i wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around ,  i'd use the blender ,  no ?   i nearly pureed some red pepper ,  trying to get it all chopped .   i have a 2 cup mini chopper  ( procter-silex ,  i think )  that is really much better at consistent chopping .   i never had to take the top off of it .   unfortunately ,  the bowl got warped in the dishwasher  ( even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe )  and the lid does not fit tightly now ,  making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs .   still ,  even warped ,  i find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad !
thought for years ,  i was missing something by not having a cuisinart !   what a laugh .   in the few months i have had this unit ,  two pusher assemblies have cracked and broken .   i did read the manual from cover to cover and watched the video prior to using .   this is an obvious design defect .   guess i was lucky ,  in that first replacement was made without a hassle or having to return anything .   now they want the broken item returned ,  which is an inconvenience and a delay .   i was without my replacement last time ,  at least six weeks .   i plan to return this item and purchase a different brand
well ,  i just got my blender ,  real excited to use it ,  filled it up with the ingredients ,  flipped on the switch  ,  and within 5 seconds it started smoking ,  badly ,  and then died .   i turned it off and tried to turn it on again ,  and all it did was make a grumbly noise .   so i am sending it back and sticking with my old hamilton that i have had for 9 years .   why did i quit using it in the first place .   $20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie .   $79 for this waring and it crashed and burned on me .   my advice is it looks nice ,  but it isn't worth the money ,  especially since it died right away on me .   oh well .  .  .
good size ,  good color but way too stiff  . i washed these 5 times with no change
i purchased this handsome can opener in june 2004 .   feels & looks substantial and promising .   it worked ok for a couple of months ,  and now it's useless .   i'll return to using my zyliss opener ,  and throw this in the trash
absolutely horrible !  the worst $20 i've every spent .   this machine is an absolute waste of money .   i have had this machine fore 2 weeks and still have not found a cup small to fit it ,  they are all either too wide or too tall .  a total headache when your rushing out to work
i returned three incantos ,  all for the same reason .  the steamer stopped working on all of them after 3-4 weeks .  it sounded like the pump failed .  i replaced it with the slightly more expensive ,  older magic comfort plus ,  which has worked like a charm
this carafe keeps beverages warm enough .   the problem i'm having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position .   the instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue ,  although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid .   despite following these instructions the push button still sticks .   to get the lid to close now after i'm done pouring i have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe .   very poor design in my opinion .   i wouldn't buy another zojirushi product based on this experience .
i ordered the my cafe from amazon in early october and received it a few days later .  on initial set-up ,  the unit failed to prime .  i talked to bunn's service dept .  and was coached to try several steps ,  which did not work .  i was given a return authorization number and told that i would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one .  i have fed ex verification that the my cafe was received by bunn on october 18 .  i called bunn on november 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes .  no return call came .  i called again on november 9th and was told that the my cafe has been on back order and that i am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment .  they could not ,  or would not ,  give me any meaningful information on when i might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original .  my cafe may be a great machine but bunn's service is atrocious
absolute rubbish . cheap ,  inferior product ,  don't waste your money .it doesn't hold in place while you mill anything .  this product isguarenteed to make you lose your temper
i am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so i bought this to make it at home .  making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions  ( i didn't watch the video )  .  the frother even works well .  the problem i had was with the flavor .  the manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time ,  but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing .  i had best results making just over one shot at a time ,  but the flavor was still burned and flat .  in the end ,  i used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker
the other reviewer was luckier than i was .  mine warped immediately ,  which forced off the end pieces
i liked the look of these pots .  i bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta ,  potatoes etc .  the stainless steel used is very poor quality .after just over a month all of them have rust spots on the bottoms and where the handles meet the pot .  after the first use i noticed small discolored spots on the inside bottoms ,  not your typical discoloration from heat ,  and they would not polish out with bar keepers friend .  these spots are now where i see rust forming after each use .  these are definitly no where near the quality of my all-clad and calphalon stainless steel cookware ,  but then again neither is the price .all said i wouldn't buy them again .  even cheap stainless steel pots and pans shouldn't rust with normal use .  even the free cuisinart santoku knife i received is rusting and i've only used it 3 times .  i cannot stress how bad the steel is !as far as cooking goes ,  they work great .  the aluminum core bottoms conduct the heat well .  they also have a great look aside from the rusting
after one wash the fitted sheet shrank and color leeched onto it so it has grey splotches in places .  we don't even have a deep mattress but now the bare mattress shows on the sides .  it'll have to go in our next garage sale .
i've heard of others complaining that these probes will end up failing under  " normal "  use .  .  .  something goes wrong at some point ,  and they just don't read right anymore .i love my taylor digital thermometer ,  and these probes seem to work with the taylor ,  but i went through 3 probes very quickly .  i use them in my weber barbeque when doing indirect heat cooking .  in spite of the fact that i took care to not route the cable over a burner ,  or anything of that sort ,  each probe lasted only 5 or 6 uses .i had ordered three at one time ,  and all of them failed in a similar way .there are other probes available that are better !  there is one available on the internet that is sold as a taylor probe replacement .  these probes look the same  ( with the 90-degree elbow bend and the right-angle mini-plug )  ,  but they have a smooth grey silicone-rubber sheathed cable ,  instead of a metal braid sheath .   i bought several of these  ( reasonably priced ,  around $12 or so )  ,  and so far ,  they have worked like champs with no failures and accurate readings from freezing to boiling .i would not recommend these probes based on my experience with very high failure rates .
the old oxo tea kettles had a train whistle sound .    this new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you couldn't hear it in the next room .   save your money and buy something cheaper .   it will work as well if not better .   i returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too .
this product was horrible .  i ordered a queen size and expected a huge box to arrive carrying such .   however ,  it was so small that a pair of shoes could have fit in it .   when i took the featherbed out of the box ,  it was terribly thin .   i currently have a featherbed and it is nice and fluffy .   this item unfortunately felt as though i was simply lying on a blanket .
i bought one of these because i think that the idea of a slicer is good .   supposed to work with soft cheese ,  eggs ,  mushrooms and other soft items .the first time i used it i decided to try it with mushrooms and on the third mushroom the cutting wires broke .   i would have returned it but for the price didn't think it was worth the trouble .   so i just tossed it .   maybe mine was defective but i doubt it
be aware ,  if you are looking for bonechina stay away from this piece .  it is made in china and very low qualit
i purchased this item from a well known home shopping tv show .   after 4 months ,  it's no longer working .   also ,  it is advertised as being able to be put into the diswasher .   i have an average size diswasher and it does not fit !  !   i have contacted the manufacturer and will return it for repair or replacement !note ,  when it worked it was great !   i mainly purchased it for the reversable grill
i'm a huge fan of le cruest's products and own a few well chosen pieces .  having said that ,  this new satin finish is a disappointment .  i was given this a gift a year ago and was thrilled  - until i used it .i really wish they'd go back to their original smooth enamel finish .  this must be an attempt to produce an interior more durable for using metal utensils with .  an attempt that in my opinion is a failure .  things  ( like eggs and hamburgers )  stick to this finish .  you have to use a lot more fat to prevent sticking .  it's hard to get clean ,  takes quite a bit of scrubbing even after soaking .  it doesn't give the finish to grilled meats ,  etc that i want from a fry pan .  forget deglazing it to make a sauce .  i find my all clad 9 inch skillet to be a superior performer to this one .since this is a 9 inch skillet ,  i haven't used it to saute onions ,  etc .  ,  so i can't say how it performs with these items .i do use it to make cornbread and to roast small portions of meats or veg in the oven ,  with good results  ( as long as i'm not going to use the browned bits to make a sauce )  .  this to me though ,  is not enough uses to justify buying it .
i decided to give this product a shot .  some reviewers said the bags would work properly if you don't overstuff them -- still not true !  a large bag re-inflated when i put 2 standard pillows in it .  so i took out 1 pillow and tried again ,  and the bag was nowhere near being full .  it seemed to work all right ,  but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated !  and if you buy the bags with the zippers ,  the zippers come off easily ,  they make sealing more difficult ,  and one even tore a hole in the bag .  i purchased straight from asseenontv . com ,  but their return policy looks a little weird .  i'm not sure if i'll get a refund .  also be careful if you order straight from asseenontv . com -- i upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later !  i guess the product was just too good to be true .
as this is a consumable food product ,  i'd like to know what each color is made of .    ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
what i most like about this product is the crumb catcher feature .   unfortunately ,  i have a problem with the acrylic piece at the end of the cutting board popping out when i am using it .   i would also recommend that the wood used be a harder wood such as is used normally with cutting boards as when i slice it leaves grooves in the wood
i bought this to simplify making fries ,  it was a disappointment .  it takes a lot of effort to push through a potato ,  and when it does go through it most likely won't go straight .  either save your money and use a knife ,  or spend more and get a mandoline
well ,  it started off a fairytale .   this small vacuum has a lot of power .   unfortunatley ,  i think i have permanant hearing damage from the volume of this vacuum .   it is extremely loud ,  it terrified my pets and i had ringing in my ears after using it .   it worked very well for about 6 months and then pooped out on me .   i'm not sure if the motor gave out or what ,  but the suction doesn't work even though the brushes still spin .   the filter is a pain !   i run a rabbit rescue and deal with a lot of pet hair ,  it just clogs up way to fast .   if you have a small apartment with merely area rugs ,  this might be ok ,  just make sure you buy some ear plugs .   yikes .
the item was not what i expected .   the description said metal but it should have said  " tin "
i wouldn't purchase anything from vision decour !  i ordered this 3 piece set the same say i ordered pieces from three other companies .  it took vision decour longer to just e-mail me than it did the other companies to ship and deliver the other three pieces i ordered .  apparently the set i ordered was out of stock ,  but vision decour neglected to update their web site .  after they contacted me about this issue i checked their site and they still had the set listed as availabel and in stock .  so now i have been waiting for weeks and have half of a living room with no prospect of getting the table set i needed to match everything else
i should have listened when the other reviewers said to stay away from this steamer .   now i wish i had spent the extra $60 and gotten one from jiffy .the box the unit arrived in was pretty beat up and did not look like it had been professionally taped .   it definitely looked like it had been returned by another customer ,  and lucky me ,  i got sloppy seconds .i read the instructions and assembled it carefully ,  but the performance is just awful .   even after letting it heat up for two minutes and then holding the trigger for 30 seconds ,  as the instructions indicate ,  it lets out a pathetic gasp of steam .   additionally ,  it sprays out great gobs of water all over the clothes ,  and i don't mean a few spots of water like you get with any  steamer
i grew up with corelle .  my mom still has a complete set she got before i was born .  it survived four kids--all boys--and three marriages .  i thought it was indestructible .i was wrong .when i lifted the box from amazon ,  i could hear shards of glass scraping around inside .  i only needed to open one flap to see that ,  indeed ,  the entire set was destroyed .  however ,  i should point out that the problem doesn't lie with amazon .  the damage is purely the result of corelle ,  which clearly didn't intend for this box to be shipped solo .  my advice :  pick up a box locally at macy's or dillard's or something
i bought a haier rtc1700ss oven from amazon about a month ago .  i am still waiting for a replacement from haier because the trays & spit did not fit .i hope by this summer i will know what it's like to cook on a con- vection oven .  i'll let you know if i ever get a chance to use the one i've already paid for
what a shame that this appliance fails at its sole purpose in life .   let's hope there's a support group for mediocre toasters
this steamer was only useful to get the wrinkles out of clothes that had been really balled up .  .  .  it gets them to a state where you can iron them more easily ,  but basically saturates with the steam so the fabric is damp .  sure there is technique to learn ,  but i spent a good long time on several different items .  it heats up quick and produces steam well etc ,  but it performed far below what i thought were reasonable expectations .  it also has a low hanger so you constantly have to extend the hose to let the condensation run back down or else get gurgling and low output .  i returned it ,  amazon was good about that ,  and the return shipping was less than what amazon charged me in the first place
i have had this pan for a year .  i bought it because it was on sale and was shopping around for a new pot set .  i figured it would be a good test run on the circulon brand .  it grills great , but you will spend  twice the cooking time cleaning the pan !  i could not imagine how much food would be left on this pan if someone without great eyesight cleaned it .  you have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out .  it is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it .  i wonder if the calphalon pan is the same ?  ?  ?  as far as the pot set i ended up buying-analon titanium 12 piece .  highly reccomend it
after 3 months of average use ,  this vaccuum stopped spinning the brushes .  the canister is difficult to empty .  i was very dissappointed because of the failure of this machine to last .  i will never buy a hoover product again
regardless of the setting you use ,  you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds .   in addition ,  the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top  .  .  .  does not work .   be prepared to grind more than you need ,  and then measure the grounds  ( somehow avoiding the powder )  yourself .
my rack came with pieces warped ,  one screw and most screw holes missing .  wood split as i was putting it together .   used it once for drying pasta ,  then once for kindling .  hope you have better luck
this is the worst basting brush i have ever encountered .   at first countless bristles fell out in my food and every time i washed it .    ( although it's dishwasher safe ,  it failed to come clean in there ,  even after a big squirt of dawn and much hand washing it isn't spotless ,  but i think i pulled most of the loose bristles out in the process .  )   it also doesn't stand up to any heat ,  i use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things  ( at about 375 degrees )  becuase i don't like the residue left by pam ,  and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time .   i also don't like the good grips in general  ( these were a gift )  the handles are too bulky and take up too much space in my utensil crock and limited apartment kitchen drawers
i bought this  " piece of junk "  at wal*mart .  i was actually surprised to see a food processor so cheap ,  so i decided to buy it .after going home and washing the product ,  i decided to try it out .  i plugged it in and nothing .  it didn't even budge !anyway ,  i am going to have to drive all the way back to wal*mart and return this .  .  .save your money and go with a more expensive model that will last you .  .
i bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed .  first of all ,  the iron is very big and heavy .  that's not really a problem by itself ,  but when the iron leaves wrinkles on a shirt as much as it did ,  it becomes a big problem .  the controls were hard to deal with .  turning the iron on and to the setting desired involved getting under the holder .  i can see someone burning their hand on a hot iron by accidentally reaching underneath to get a grip in order to work the controls on a hot iron .the water receiver only accepts water when the iron is laying flat .  well ,  that's fine if the iron isn't hot ,  but what if you decide you need water while ironing ?  the steam controls either don't work on the unit i have ,  or they don't work similar to any other iron i've used .this iron is far worse than the sunbeam i'm trying to replace due to inherent problems and leaks
the kitchenaid professional 5 plus  ( kv25g0x )  is a great product ,  but you should buy it elsewhere .  we ordered it from amazon ,  and got the commercial  ( km25g0x )  instead .  we did not want that ,  so contacted customer service .  they said they'd exchange it ,  but they sent us another km25g0x .  no good ,  obviously .  then ,  the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse ,  so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise .  they said they sometimes substituted similar products .  great .at this point we gave up ,  and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer
i found this product cumbersome ,  and the instructions for assembly ,  battery replacement ,  etc .  were not very clear .  the vacuum didn't hold a charge well ,  and it was hard to remove the batteries for replacement .  i finally gave up altogether and bought a different product
i bought 2 sets expecting them to be as good as the other corning products i have used for over 30 years .   1 piece cracked in half while cooking vegetable in the microwave and one piece cracked in half while baking chicken in the oven !   i wrote to the company and they have not responded
amazon took over a month in shipping me this roomba battery .  it works ok .  also the list price is too high on this amazon site .
this chopper ,  if you can call it that ,  is terrible .   i've tried chopping all kinds of foods from veggies to fruit to nuts to cheese .   i've tried filling up the bowl ,  half full and barely anything at all .   it doesn't chop .   plain and simple it just doesn't chop the food .   i've had pieces of vegetables get stuck on the blade .   then ,  i'd have to stop and remove the piece and try again .   it started to chop a little a couple of times ,  but then just stopped and the blade kept spinning while chopping nothing .it was horrible and i've opted now for a bigger 7 cup kitchen aid or cuisinart processor based on reviews here .lesson learned ,  you get what you pay for
my only reservation is for safety sake ,  it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless ,  because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet .
i am usually very pleased with oxo products ,  but this one is a big disappointment .   i have not found it to be good for or at anything .   wished i'd saved the five bucks
i'm surprised you requested this review because i returned the item .   theywere just what i wanted ,  color and all ,  but when i tried to put the dinnerplates in the dishwasher they only fit if i placed them using two spaces .this reduced the dishwasher capacity .   next problem surfaced when the samedinner dishes didn't fit in my standard sized kitchen cabinet
i have to echo some of the other customers' negative sentiments below - this thing never really worked well .   recently i noticed it had completely died ;  i think i used it all of 6 times .   there have to be better models out there - i wouldn't recommend this one
i bought this because it was well priced ,  good sized and looked better than many other slow cookers .  i assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that i gave away .  the first time i used it  ( as soon as it got up to tempurature )  the lid started to rumble and slip around the top .  then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter .  the lid is the worst !  at first i thought maybe i was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid .  now i realize this is the way it was designed !  i made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid .  the only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly , tumbly , bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter .  not to mention its probably a fire hazard .  i don't think my paper towel idea is what rival had in mind when they designed this !  i wish i could return this but i threw away the receipt .
i bake a lot of cookies .   i love my mixer but and concerned and disappointed in this piece of equipment .   it peels and chips constantly and those pieces of plastic paint mysteriously disappear into  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?      how can they sell this type of faulty equipment
you get what you paid for .   nice pattern ,  but the bedding is somewhat rough to the touch .   wouldn't give it as a gift
i have the large one tried to use it on coffee .  .  .  .  can't get it to work .  love the rest of the products
this product is a disgrace .  nonstick is not one of its virtues ,  and those who are thinking of purchasing this waste of money should be forewarned .  it is not even well designed for broiling with small openings for fat drainage that quickly clog up .  i am honestly surprised that amazon would allow such an unworthy product to be sold under its banner
for approximately six months i owned this knife .   i used it everyday as it far outshined my other henkel chefs knife in balance ,  cutting efficiency and need for regular sharpening .   until a few weeks ago when i was peeling a clove of garlic with the knife .   lo and behold .  .  . i know have a two inch blade attached to the handle and five inches of steel sitting on the countertop .   i am currently looking for other brands of this knife style as i was unhappy with the manufactures complete lack of response regarding my complaint
i ordered these glasses 3 times and everytime they came in a million pieces .  i would not waste your time purchasing these
i felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set .  the grill cover started to desapair ,  and the last time i cooked a stek using this set ,  the paint sticked to the meat ,  leaving black spots .  it started to show deteriorazion and everytime i washed i have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon .the deep pan it is ok ,  perhaps because i did not used that piece with the same frequency .i never used metal utensills or harsh detergents durig the cleaning ,  i always leave it in hot water first and later do the cleaning ,  to avoid scratches .thank you for your attentionnilda
i bought this product thinking that it would be better than the cordless spotlifter that i had previously owned .  the  " powerbrush "  just grinds in the spot and water flow required to loosen the stain must be hand pumped a little squirt or more accurately a dribble at a time .  the prevoius cordless spotlifter pumped large amounts of water under pressure and made the clean up much easier .also the suction is lousy compaired to the old cordless version .  once the spot is wet and loosened there is not sufficient suction to pick up the water .i'm sorry i bought this product .  it does a very poor job
brass rivets expand and contract .  wood expands and contracts .  together these elements are a bad concept from the word  " go "  ,  because they will ultimately separate because someone will at one time or another put them in the dishwasher .  the metal is only tempered 4 times leaving the metal soft ,  meaning there is a lot of sharpeing to do .  henckel ,  cutco ,  trident are expensive and chefs all over the world use them because the are used everyday and they retain their sharpness because they are tempered 7 times  ( the maximum amount before metal becomes so hard that it becomes brittle )wood is pourus and is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria .  you don't just wipe off knives and put them in a wood butcher block ?  what moran came up with that great concept ?  utensils need to be sterilzed through a dish washer and very hot water with good cleaning agents .why woould you buy a knife that you can't put in the dish washer ?  why would you ever purchase a knife that requires maintenance .  there's no moving partswood handle and stainless steel spells disaster .  learning to sharpen your own knives is not easy ,  chefs don't even do it .  reading direction from a pamphlet and attempting to sharpen your knives for the first time spells disaster .  your knives will never be the same if you attempt this .  companies sell sharpening tools to inexperienced knife sharpeners  ( like yourself )  so they wreck their own knives and buy new .  you buy clothes that require dry cleaning ,  correct ?   bring your knives in and have them professionally sharpened and protect your investment .  you should only buy one pair of knives in your lifetime and they can be handed down from generation to generation .a dull knife is a dangerous knife .  a dull knife will require more pressure which will lead to a person cutting themselves .take it from me .  i was a ceo with a company who marketed these knives to people like you and we made alot of money too .  these knives were never designed to be passed on from generation to generation
in theory ,  this is a good machine .   it did ,  in fact ,  work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell .   all of the urine ,  drinks ,  vomit ,  whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet ,  starts to pool under the holding tank .   as it festers there ,  the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house .   this ,  to an extent ,  is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet ,  making more mess than you started with .   the first time this happened ,  bissell customer service sent a replacement unit .   we started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it .   bissell only wants to send us another  ( no doubt defective )  unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky ,  urine-leaking ,  mess-maker ,  don't buy this product  !
i purchased this wok for my husband's christmas present .   it was lovely ,  we cooked two meals in it christmas day .   nice heat transfer ,  beautiful on the table  ( but big )  .   that night ,  he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan .   it's considerably narrower than the normal le creuset handle .   back it went to williams sonoma ,  where there were a few other l . c .  woks with similar cracks !   phooey to you ,  le creuset .i wish i could find another glass lidded joyce chen wok - my old one was the best ,  before it was dropped one too many times
i ordered this stupid thing one month ago and they delayed multiple times and kept saying delay .  these things will never come .  so never expect cheap things from amazon although they tried very hard to convince you to wait .
we registered for a set of 10 wmf utensils for our wedding .   they look great hanging in our kitchen and most all of the utensils are very functional .   however ,  we are now on our second scooper and it has broken now for the second time .   its just not sturdy enough for its intended use .  .  . ice cream
last year ,  i bought a pizza stone from pampered chef .   it was a rousing success with my family .   for the 5 of us ,  however ,  one stone was not enough and i wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time .   sadly ,  the product did not come through .   my pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off .   i tried going against the directions and didn't preheat the stone the second time .   it stuck even worse !   the pizza didn't get fully done in the middle ,  while the pampered chef pizza was perfect both times .   i will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from pampered chef .   you get what you pay for !  !
i was pretty happy with this toaster oven until last night when it just stopped working while i was baking some potatoes .  i have no idea why it would just quit working like that .  i am not happy at all with this product
i wish i saw the feedback before i bought this .  .  . this thing sucks you have to charge it 15hours just to get 23minutes of nothing .  .  it has no power and it just pushes the cheese it doesnt even grade it .  .  . please dont waste your mone
i realize i'm in the minority here ,  but i do not find this can opener comfortable to use .   the crank does have a  " good grip "  ,  but i'm not trying to grip it ,  i'm trying to turn it .    i do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up ,  with my index finger on the far end pushing down .   the knob's shape  ( relatively short ,  fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends )  makes this cumbersome and tiring .   it does open cans cleanly most of the time ,  but if i'm opening a large can or several cans ,  i reach for my old basic swingaway  ( which sells ,  incidentally ,  for less than half the price of this oxo )
very disappointing !   spend your money somewhere else .   i threw away a perfectly good but old made in the usa thermos bottle and bought this made in china nissan 0 . 79-quart stainless-steel insulated bottle back in june of 2005 .   ten months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function .   i think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which i think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside .   when you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - think again
this unit simply does not do the job .  press makes irregular shaped tortillas and they cannot be easily removed from the wax paper .  better job can be done with 2 dinner plates .  save your money
i am a major fan of  " le creuset "  pots and have a number of them but i must say that their kettle is not up to par .like the other lady said ,  it does spit out water  ( substantially at that )  when it boils on the stove .   i am finally throwing mine out to the garbage since i have had it for a while and the coating at the inside bottom of the kettle is coming apart and i have been boiling  " contaminated "  water since a while .  .  . i just noticed one day that there was this stuff floating on top of the water .  .  .  . i wonder what kind of chemicals i have been putting in my body ?  ?  ?
these dishes ,  first of all ,  are just beautiful .   the white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous .   that said ,  be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them .  they break horribly easily and the cleanup ,  well ,  we just won't go there .   i've had mine for 10 years and now i'm down to just two of the serving pieces .   they break very easily in the oven ,  in the cabinet ,  you name it ,  it's gone .   if you're looking for a better one ,  go for the le creuset la poterie line ,  or just grab a longaberger one .   they're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece .   i hate trying to clean these after using them so i just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items .   that way ,  nothing gets baked on them and i am not breaking nails scouring off the mess .   i definitely recommend getting something else
i read all of the reviews and thought this was the paper towel holder for me .  boy ,  was i wrong .  it looked beautiful when it arrived and i couldn't wait to use it .  well ,  i put on my first roll of paper towels and pulled one off .  the racheting system worked ok until it came towards the end of the roll .  the racheting stopped and jammed and the paper towels ripped in half instead of where they were supposed to .  i am going back to the old paper towel holders that just have a stick holding the roll and not a racheting whisk like bar .  jesh ,  all i want is a paper towel not aggravation .  which is what i got with this item
the fiestaware scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous .   the handle is much too small for this size mug .   if you can get your finger through the small hole ,  your finger will soon be as scarlet as the fiestaware .   the first and only time my family used these mugs ,  two of us burned ourselves .fiestaware really screwed up on this one ,  a shame given the beauty of the scarlet fiestaware
bought this for the kitchen and the only piece that truly does what it is supposed to do is the vase they give to hold all the pieces .   the spoons both melted in pots of boiling water stirring spaghetti .   the spatula bent and distorted while trying to lift something off a hot cookie sheet .if there was a choice to give a half star ,  that is all i would give .  .  .  .  . you have to give them some credit ,  since the vase looks nice on the counter &lt ; grin
i chose this set of knives because of the calphalon name  ( i love my cookware !  )  ,  german steel use ,  and the description ,   " hygienic fiberglass-reinforced poly resin handle will not absorb moisture ,  crack ,  split ,  or chip .  "   i was disappointed to find that one of the sets i ordered was already showing signs of rust -- even though the set was unused and delivered in a  " sealed "  box ,  all four handles had rust marks
i bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly .   i called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange .   i was under the impression they would send it out but when i called ,  i was told i was supposed to send in $14 . 95 for shipping or i could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when i returned it .   the new unit i received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than  to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again i just used a manual timer .   it baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans .  i just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in ,  including the oven but i doubt i will reorder this product .   too unpredictible .
we also bought the fcp12 after years of hearing from satisfied farberware users .  unfortunately it only worked about three months until it also made lukewarm ,  tea - like coffee .  i removed the bottom and wiggled the wires and it worked great for another month or so .  after a few times of this monkey business ,  i contacted farberware and was told i had voided my warranty by removing a single nut from the base .  the best they could offer was a refurbished unit at half price .  shipping would be on me both directions as well ,  i told them i would not pay any price for another one of their products ,  based on our experience and their lack of any desire to acknowledge the widespread problem or help to fix it .  i am going to try replacing the thermostat ,  as i like perked coffee ,  but i am not convinced it will last any longer ,  time will tell
i have had these dishes for only 1 year and they have all chipped and cracked and the glaze is cracked as well .   i have re-ordered a set of bowls and several plates and had the same results .   they say they are  " microwave safe "  but after the first few uses ,  the dish heats up to the point of burning your hand  ( or worse yet the unsuspecting hand of your child or guest !  )  and the food/liquid inside stays cold .   i am so disappointed and am now shopping for a new set of dishes
like 7 of the 8 other reviews ,  this product broke with no way to repair it .   for the price and apparent sturdiness ,  it is just one big failure and is to be avoided .
i purchased these pans based on my previous positive experiences with calphalon cookware--have tons of it ,  but i experienced the same problem as two other reviewers--that is ,  the slumping in the middle .   i have been cooking for over 30 years and have never experienced this problem ,  especially since i have a new kitchen-aid convection oven .   also ,  the &quot ; non-stick&quot ;  is not so &quot ; non-stick&quot ;  .    at their prices ,  i think they have a little work to do to meet other calphalon products
the only 2 foods it grates well are parmesan and chocolate ,  as long as the chocolate is cold ,  not worth the money ,  i think i'd rather use my small hand held gater .   it was a good try ,  but i won't buy another one
this thermometer is very cheaply made .  it feels flimsy and the magnets on the back won't hold it secure on a metal surface
i bought this box about 4 months ago and stopped using it about 2 months ago .  it turned out to be more work than just a regular box .  at least you can wash out a regular box and start over clean .  good luck with completely cleaning all the poo crumbs from the sliding track and cheap gears .  it gets to be a disgusting affair ,  more than with a regular box .as other reviews said the rake only goes over the top half of the litter so there's tons of sticky cement left at the bottom which you have to manually scrape out .  it was often unable to push the clumps into the bin .  so it would just very noisily push until it got stuck ,  back up ,  and then start over again like 10 times in a row .  when it does get clumps into the bin ,  it also pushes tons of litter through the crack between the bin and the box and then you're left with a huge pile of litter underneath the box .  to clean it ,  you have to take it apart .  the top part houses a computer so you can't soak it which means there's poo always stuck in the crevices .  ever see office space ?  at the end of two months i was ready to bring this thing out in a field and bash it with a sledgehammer .now we're looking for another box .  currently ,  we are just using the plastic box from the littermaid without the rake ,  etc .  this is my worst investment to date .
don't waste your money .  i bought this because it was small and i wanted a rice cooker that would make 3 cups and take up less storage space than the bigger ones .it burns the rice every time no matter how much i adjust the water ratio .  and brown rice - forget it ,  even more burned on the bottom .  you have to watch it instead of being able to rely on it doing what it says it will do .  it has yet to turn out 'perfect rice . 'if i could rate this a zero i would
my first and only use was to cook a roast in the oven at 275 degrees and within the first 30 minutes it started to give me the wrong readings .   i have had it a while but have not used it as it is only good for the oven .  the statement on the inside instructions  " when cooking in a barbecue or smoker ,  do not use as a continuous read thermometer ,  use only as an instant read thermometer .  "  ,   " 5 .  do not use this unit to measure cooking temperatures over 392&#9702 ; f .  "  as well as  " warranty excludes thermometer probes .  "  should be on the outside ,  letting people know this is only for the oven for continuous use and that the probes are junk .   if you have to keep checking the meat in a smoker over many hours ,  a cheap $6 . 00 meat thermometer will work just fine other than letting out the heat .   why does the outside packaging say the reading range is 86&#9702 ;  to 572&#9702 ;  if you can only use to 392&#9702 ;  .   i would say this is only a typo and they likely did a cut and paste on their lower temperature unit's instructions ,  but 275&#9702 ;  in the oven killed mine so maybe not ?   cut to the chase ,  look for a better unit and let me know when you find it
the furniture itself is fine .  or rather ,  it would be if it was shipped properly .  before ordering anything from target ,  think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return .  if you receive something damaged  ( and you will )  ,  be prepared for an extensive return process .  chances are ,  the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well .  this happened to me twice .  if you're lucky ,  you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments .  this ,  however ,  will take time .  additionally ,  even if the piece is not cracked ,  you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood .  i bought the desk ,  the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain .also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier .  after waiting and waiting ,  and calling target on several occasions ,  someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications .quite honestly ,  this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth .  by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax ,  this is not so much a  " deal "  but a waste of time and money .
i am writing this to warn all of you cooks and bakers at home ,  that like me ,  prefer real commercial equipment in your kitchen .   anything less is just a toy .   i had purchased the waring pro 1500 convection oven thinking this would be a quality convection oven to replace a farberware convection oven that i have had for over 10 years and just plain wore out .   i ordered the waring pro 1500 from a catalog/online store other than amazon ,  i don't know if it is legal to say ,  but it does have the word chef's in it .   i was so excited to get it !   i opened the box ,  set it up ,  and was so disappointed .   it was made so poorly i was just sick .   the stainless steel top was not smoothed out ,  the oven door was installed so crooked it scraped the metal off of the side of the controls ,  and it had been dropped or something before packing because the feet were up inside of the thing ,  and the top was bent down .   the shipping packaging was fine ,  there was no broken packing and the box was fine .   ok ,  so i sent that one back ,  got a replacement thanks to the wonderful customer service at the online store ,  and opened the second one ,  same thing !  !   i was so devastated ,  that i decided to give it a shot anyhow .   while cooking with it ,  the door had such a bad seal that it just steamed out the front ,  sides and bottom .   i was amazed that there could be such shoddy workmanship out there on what was being advertised as commercial quality .   ok ,  so oven number two went back ,  and i tried one more ,  what the heck three strikes you are out right ?   right !  !   finally oven number three came and it was put together so much better ,  seal looked good ,  top and feet looked good ,  so i decided to give it a whirl .   once again ,  huge disappointment .   the convection fan goes on and off with the burner coils .   thus not giving the cooking cycle a true convection .   i called waring customer service and it was confirmed by engineering that they designed the fan to come on and off with the coils .   bad design !   it took longer to bake cookies in there than it would my regular oven ,  and then they were hard and dry .   i rotisseried a chicken and it took over 1 and a half hours and when i cut it ,  the skin was soggy ,  not crisp ,  and it wasn't cooked all the way through after 90 minutes !   the thing popped  ( sounded like it was going to blow up )  every time it heated up because they riveted the rack holders in there so tight ,  also making it nearly impossible to go from racks to using baking trays .   ok ,  that was it !  !   after extensive internet research ,  i finally found a convection oven that is truly a commercial oven made for residential use ,  and exchanged it with the wonderful catalog/online store mentioned before and got the cadco commercial  ( and i do mean commercial )  half size convection oven model number ov-350 and have used it many times since it's arrival and absolutely love it !  !   i know it is twice the price ,  but as usual ,  you get what you pay for .   there is a smaller size version of the cadco/broilking oven that is quarter size ,  for people that do not need to bake huge quantities like me ,  that is the same price as the waring pro .   please people ,  if you are at all a person that demands quality in your kitchen ,  do not waste your time on the waring pro ,  just skip right to the real commercial stuff and save yourself some major stress !  !   thanks again to the wonderful customer service at the aforementioned catalong/online company for not making me be stuck with the worthless waring pro 1500 !  !   go for the cadco !
i feel it was an unlucky day when i bought this pot .   as careful as i tried to be ,  it was extremely difficult to tell if i had correctly placed the stem  ( with basket )  in the pit .   it had to be by  " feel ,  "  and half the time it was apparently a hair's breadth off and would not perk .   or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet .   it was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot .   a hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk .   so each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day i got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds .   i am returning to my old friend ,  the farberware fc280 .   it may or may not last more than a year but at least i can depend on it
i had a russel hobbs electric kettle ,  made in the uk ,  which worked well for 3 years .  when it finally died ,  i ordered one of these ,  based on the glowing reviews .  it arrived new from amazon not working .lf  port jefferson ,  n
the black & decker ic200 arctic twister ice cream mixer is a product that you must not purchase .  it is a total waste of money .  it's designed to make soft-serve ice cream at home .  the are not enpough pro's and way too many cons .  the only pro :  it makes soft-serve ice cream when ever you want .cons1 .  it's loud and noisy2 .  the ice cream you use in it must be as frozen as it is the second it comes out of the freezer which makes it very hard to scoop out .3 .  if not used correctly ,  it make a huge mess .4 .  it wastes ice cream .  when you use this product ,  half of the ice cream gets stuck inside the machine .5 .  by the time its finished ,  ice cream is pratically melted .6 .  you ongly get about 1/3 of what you put in the machine .  the rest gets stuck inside the machine .7 .  you have to hold onto the on switch while operating the machine .8 .  you have to hand pump the ice cream into soft-serve yourself .this black & decker ic200 arctic twister ice cream mixer is such a waste of money .  i so reccomend not buying this .  just going to dairy queen or baskin robins is a much easier and cleaner solutio
this item is cheaply made and i sent it back .   the picture looks cool but it's deceiving .   the minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side ,  it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left ,  it plopped down to the left .   it couldn't keep the right time
this products is horrible .   it burns the rice and the heat actually bend the insert so the lid would not fit anymore and after using it only a handful of times it stopped working .   it is really terrible would give it zero but there is no option
i was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and i needed to send it back for a refund
when i received this item it was packaged with the wrong power cord ,  which didn't fit the unit .  so i wasn't even able to use this unit .
i wanted to like this toaster .   it looks nice ,  seems sturdy enough ,  and stays cool to the touch .   but it toasts poorly .   one side of the bread toasts more than the other .   so i have to pop up the toast 1/2 way through and turn it over .   and now the pop up mechanism isn't working well
we have had this machine for about a year and it might have work right the first time we used it .   we now have to borrow a friends hoover steamvac when we need to clean the carpet .   we are getting ready to buy a different machine bcause this one would never work right .   it never has any suction power and it constantly sprays soap everywhere even if you have it only on the water selection .   i wouldn't buy
first of all i was abt to buy this product .  .  .  but cancled my purchase as i found the same kind toaster with less price in the market .  .but same time i bought one kitchen utensils set .  .  and i am sorry to say it is just usable not good one like i they shown .  .  i saw many utensils set with same number of item atleast 500% times better than what i got ,second thing ,  i wanted to cancle the order immidiately but i tried to find out the customer care no on the amazon site .  .  but i could not find one  : o (  (any way thats why i have decided not to buy from this site anymore .  .  .as now i can't rely on the pics only .  .
the coffee maker was working fine as long as i was using the presto mypods with no filter in them .  .then ,  i tried using some pods in the regular pod holder .  coffee all over the counter every time .  .  i suspect that using the pods created back pressure that ruptured something internally .based on the fact then when used as intended it fails miserably ,  i would have to say that it is an example of shoddy engineering .  .  junk ,  garbage ,  crudbtw - if yours is working ,  i found that the secret to decent tasting coffee was to wash the pod holder  ( the presto mypod )  with soap and water every time and throw the pod holders in the dishwasher once in a while .i guess they let some three year olds design the thing on a 'take your kids to work' day .
i thought  " kitchenaid "  this has to be a keeper .  i was wrong .  the handles are much too heavy .  there's too much give with the spatulas .  i find the utensils to be too bulky and uncomfortable .  i'll stick to my other much cheaper temperature regulated utensils
we bought this to use at events for a chocolate-themed group at college ,  and used it several times before giving up .the cord is in the way ,  you need a shallow dish to pour the batter into so you can dip the crepe maker ,  and the crepes tend to fall off half-baked .  we eventually gave up---now we just put chocolate on waffles
i bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust .   well ,  sure enough ,  rust started to form on the knives just after the first run through the dishwasher .   the rust spots were small ,  but i returned the set anyways ,  as i am not willing to risk the severe rust problems reported by others .and just for the record ,  i did not use lemon detergent ,  and i only allowed the set to stay in the dishwasher a short while after the cycle completed .   this set is at best a high maintenance proposition .   hand washing and drying is not for me !its a shame ,  because the set really is beautiful
i find that such a well-known brand would have a longer warranty than 12 months .  my blender broke  ( it was the  " coupler "  )  after about 18 months of use .  i emailed ka about it and all they did was give me two repair shops where i could pay to have it fixed .  both repair shops are more than one hour away .  they also offered me  [  .  .  .  ]  off a  " refurbished "  blender .  gee .  .  . what service .  you'd think they'd at least work with me since the blender wasn't even 2 years old .  for  [  .  .  .  ]  i went out and bought a cuisinart and that comes with a 3 year warranty .  ka blender was not worth my  [  .  .  .  ]  .  it never blended fruit all the way ,  either ;  it always left chunks of bananas
it's just bad looking plastic .  if you want expresso buy nespresso machine with capsules
the machine is easy to use and makes great espresso  .  .  .  when it's working ! mine broke down within the first year .   i spent $80 dollars to fix it the first time ,  but it broke down again after another two months of use  ( water wouldn't heat up )  .   it would cost me another $200 to fix it .   i'm now looking for a more reliable machine .
this is a disapointment for me .  i ordered these sheets in white ,  and recieved ivory .   ( unlike other reviewers i am not talking about a tinge of ivory ,  my package said ivory instead of white .  )  i would return these sheets ,  but they are a gift for my mother ,  and since they took so long to ship ,  i won't have time to get her anything else !  i have never had a bad experience with amazon products ,  some of the third party sellers could be better ,  but usually amazon it's self is pretty good .  not in this case !  the sheets do feel nice ,  and hopefully they work out for my mother ,  but i am keeping my paperwork and packaging just incase she runs into any problems !buyer beware :  $200 dollar sheets for $30 is too good to be true
the v2 is one of the worst built appliances ever especially at about $250 .  without exaggeration i have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece  ( breaks )  ,  a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly .  it seems to fall apart ,  leak ,  and requires constant attention .  i now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don't rotate .  and this is with use maybe once a month .  frankly ,  i'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable  ( and expensive )  quality
i was very pleased with the le creuset baking dishes i have  ( i have the poterie 10 "  x 13 "  deep dish baker ,  14 "  oval baker ,  and 9 "  square dishes as well as this one )  .   however ,  my 12 "  dish just cracked down the middle while i was cooking a pork roast in it at 425 degrees .   it had only been in the oven about 45 minutes .   i am sorely disappointed and now i am wondering if i wasted my money on the others .   i have only had it for about 2 1/2 months
the temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected !   over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it .  this means the thermometer has a short life span for people who rely on the markings for anything  ( which granted is not everyone )  .   last time i buy an oven thermometer in which the markings don't sit behind a glass face !
after a couple of years of casual use ,  my bowl also cracked in the freezer .  fortunately i had it wrapped in a plastic bag so the mess was kept to a minimum .  now i'm in the market for one with a higher quality bowl .
we had to return this item for a refund .  it arrived and never worked .
have had it for three years but haven't used it much .  the times i have used it ,  it has worked very well .dislikes :  cant tell when it is done boiling the water .  there is no indicator .  the only way is to hear the switch click from on to off .also ,  there is a min and max line for the amount of water needed to use .  however ,  very hard to see so i used a sharpee to highlight on the outside .  would be nice if it had cup indicator markings or other markings to tell you how much water you are boiling
received this toaster as a christmas present in 2004 .   from day one i was not very happy with it .   the knobs and temperature control are difficult to use - sometimes it would bake good ,  other times it would not .   about 6 months ago i noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial .   about 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time .   today the timer dial broke off completely .   so i got about a year and a half of poor use out of it .   so ,  don't purchase this product ,  it is not worth it .
the frother is great !   easy to use etc .   the espresso temperature is 140 degrees f when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes .   at that low temperature you can't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso .   other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate .   this occurs when the grind is too fine .   i've had this machine for over a year and it is not recommended .  i use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine .   to add insult to injury ,  the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap .   i thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble .   previously i had a gaggia which is superior in every manner ,  and cheaper also .   the only reason i rated it 2 stars is because of the frother .
i finally just threw them out .  they were apparently cured with some chemical and the smell was terrible .
i bought this product about a year ago and for a while it worked great .  then i noticed that the unit was starting to shut off faster and faster until today when i finally decieded to toss her .  overall in the beginning yes there is alot of power but what is the good of it when the battery's life is only about a year before she goes .  i wouldnt recommend one especially since dirt devil came out with a cyclone one which i will try with hopefully longer lasting results .
fiesta scarlet is a beautiful color and the sugar and creamer with tray is really great .   mine arrived broken and i had difficulty returning it so i remain disappointed and unwilling to try again .
the littermaid mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases i have ever made .   in less than two months time ,  the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely .   litter maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat .   well ,  i have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily .   the litter maid is good for controlling odors when it works ,  but it constantly jammed and then shut down  ( and i used a recommended brand of premium cat litter )  .   after a few weeks of this load ,  the tiny  ( and very loud )  motor simply gave up .   i'm waiting to hear from litter maid regarding warranty repair/replacement ,  but i suspect i'll end up returning to a traditional $5 . 00 litter tray .   the overall concept of the litter maid is good ,  but without sturdier components ,  it ends up being trash in no time
i have gone through 2 of these now and both ceramic inserts have cracked in the same place !   cuisinart customer service is not interested in replacing the inserts even though i have only used it 2 times before they cracked and were unusable .   i had to send the pot back for replacement and the replacement had the same trouble .my cheap rival crockpot that i had for years before i purchased this one never had problems or i would think that this was operator error .   i was really looking forward to using this because i love all my other cuisinart products but i am going today to purchase a nice ,  inexpensive ,  reliable rival crockpot .
i bought a set of these years ago ,  and used them almost daily .  .  . freezer to oven to table ,  on the range .  . never a problem ,  and wanted to replace the same sized casserole .  as the previous reviewer stated , the rough and unfinished  bottom of the dish was coarse and gritty ,  and scratched my table and counter .  what a disappointment !  i don't believe the older set i have was made in china ,  but here in the usa .  save your money
looks great in my kitchen but i ,  too ,  only use it for shakes & smoothies .   it does smell like burning rubber nearly every time .   i used to think something was wrong with it and now i just disregard it .   and after less than two years or making smoothies ,  i'm replacing the blade & gasket assembly .
the fiestaware scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous .   the handle is much too small for this size mug .   if you can get your finger through the small hole ,  your finger will soon be as scarlet as the fiestaware .   the first and only time my family used these mugs ,  two of us burned ourselves .fiestaware really screwed up on this one ,  a shame given the beauty of the scarlet fiestaware
i was really hopeful about this product working .   i have four dogs ,  ages 2 through 8 .   i tried and tried to teach them how to use this product ,  but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button .   they just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it
i bought this cookie press to make my favorite christmas cookies-spritz .   i got the dough into the gun ,  squeezed the handle ,  kept squeezing the handle ,  and nothing .   the mechanism that was supposed to push the dough out thru the disk kept slipping ,  and hence ,  no cookies .   it was very frustrating ,  having everything ready to make the cookies ,  but with no way to properly form them .   i would not recommend this cookie press
i went to amazon after having several problems with this coffee maker only to find lots of others with the same problems .   yes ,  delonghi makes a great product .   no ,  this is not one of them .   i have read the directions so often i have them memorized ,  and i can tell from the number of reviews that there is a serious quality control problem with this unit .   i bought mine from costco ,  and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for costco product runs .   i hope that is not the problem ,  but that is all i can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews .   so .  .  . who else bought this unit from costco ?   because if that is the problem i'll bet costco will be all over delonghi to fix it .   until then ,  this is definitely not the coffee maker you will look forward to first thing in the morning ,  every day
i purchased this black &amp ;  decker food processor on 12/30/04 at target .  i used it the first time to grate cheese and loved it .  however ,  i used it tonight for only the 2nd time to chop some onion and celery and it started smelling hot .  smoke started pouring out the back .  i will be returning to target tomorrow and not purchasing another black &amp ;  decker kitchen appliance
works if you have cold soda and it's frozen .  after 2 cans it's done .  yes you get two of the sleeves ,  but i'm not pleased .  better luck with a 99 cent foam coozi
there are a lot of theoretically good ideas that  fail when executed .  this is one of them .  1/quality : it's made cheaply ,  and even before it breaks ,  it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence .  2/resistance : the levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression  ,  as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks ,  ( many will be unchallenged right from the beginning )  .  the standard :  if the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue ,  you need more resistance .  3/compared to crunches :  there's a reason why crunches are done lying down :  the weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance ,  whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort ,  as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up .  much of what makes the ab crunch machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it ,  not your muscles working .  this little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides .   ( you may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect ,  but you can get -exactly- this effect ,  or -better- ,  without any equipment at all !  just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so .  )  .  .  .  of course ,  by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down  (  ?  ?  )  to do crunches is ,  we've reached the real problem :  this thing is designed to avoid effort .  it seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort .  unfortunately ,  exercise is effort ,  and the more you avoid effort ,  the less exercise you get
i read the reviews after i purchased it .  we made grated cheese  ( turned out so so )  and *tried* to make hummus but it wouldn't even turn the blade and was very ,  very noisy .  i'm returning it to target tomorrow .  if it can't stand up to crushing a few cooked beans then it's no good to me .until i find a better one i'm using my 10 speed osterizer blender i've had for 10 years .  it made hummus easily
we received 3 sets of this for a wedding present .   i really liked how the polished silver shined and how they felt in your hand .    however ,   after just one wash there were quite a few that had rust spots .    after two more washes the rust got worse .   these are supposed to be dishwasher safe !   there are recommendations to hand wash these and dry them ,  but who has the time for that these days ?   despite the apeal of the set ,  we decided to try something else .    it's a shame because it's such a pretty set  ( before the wash of course !  )  .
the soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet .    ( children would love this feature .  )   you have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm .   also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually .   you cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use
i too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit ,  and mind you ,  you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer .   i have tried putting hot water in the tank in an attempt to regain its original shape to no avail .   i would not recommend buying this steamer for this reason
the timer worked great at first ,  but in less than a month ,  the alarm for the timer has stopped working and the magnet has fallen off .   i am only keeping the timer because the clock and the stopwatch are still useful
i sent it back because the shaft that was supposed to fit down through a hole didn't ,  no matter how i considered the matter ,  so never tried it ,  sent it back ,  asked for a refund .   : - (
why would anyone want pots that can't be used on high heat ,  can't be washed in the dishwasher or can't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish .   my calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly .   i have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who haven't owned these pots for longi am a real cook and use my pots several times a day ,  i need them to work ,  not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental .   after leaving them on the heat too long ,  just once ,  they warp .   food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads .   after a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake ,  the pot finish was ruined ,  and i had aluminum coming off on my food .   i am someone who takes good care of my things ,  and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish .   i had taken some  comfort in the  " lifetime "  warantee ,  i tried to return them ,  but the warantee ,  like this cookware is absolutely useless
i received the 14 . 4 volt vacuum for christmas 2004 .   after a full charge ,  it lasts less than a minute .   it would be great if the battery lasted ,  but it doesn't .   go with another product and save your money on this piece of junk
i bought this item for my daughter for christmas and after she removed it from the box i took a look at it to check it over and i discovered there was missing paint where the band is that goes around the top of the mixer .  do i get the feeling that the mixer i purchased was a defect .  i ordered another one for my other daughter and i will have her check that over also .  i am not happy with this and i will have to look into this matter
inside this unit there are 2 cleaning trays ,  one for the cleaning solution and the other for water to rinse .  each tray has a cup coming out the bottom which is used to lock the tray into the device .  after only 3 uses the base of the one cup cracked .  after about 6 more uses the other bottom cracked .  i would not recommend this product to anyone .
i had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely .  the rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter ,  even with daily cleaning .  sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night ,  very noisily ,  until i put a timer on it to turn off at night .  it was very diffult to clean ,  even with daily inspection .go the old fashioned way ,  with a tray and a liner
flimsy .  mine started rusting after 2 months .  but then again ,  what can one expect for this price
this press doesn't seem to work well .   the top browns much more quickly than the bottom .   clean up isn't all that easy .   i was surprised by how small the grill surface was
i loved the way the vortex digital heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch .   but within a week ,  the one i had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on .   i was worried that it was overheating all the time and called vortex who told me i could send it in at my expense and pay $15 to fix it .   i emailed my amazon seller  ( louise at pinnacle packaging )  who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her ,  and is going to refund my money .   i think i am going to buy another one only i am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure i can bring it back if the new one does the same thing .   i guess i am a sucker but i really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly
i have this scraper and after just a few uses ,  it fell apart at the connection in the center .  normally ,  i rave about kitchenaid ,  but this product was truly a disappointment
i really liked this spatula in the beginning ,  but after just 6 months of very gentle use its head developed cracks and chipped .
this delonghi toaster oven was not made as well as the previous one we had .   the grey plastic on the sides made it look cheap .   the stainless steel was very thin too .  you could bend it easily .we returned the oven
the unique design of this dinnerware line is lost in the low quality earthenware body .   this low fired clay body breaks easily ,  is bulky to handle and is just plain disappointing .   before you buy ,  beware .   what is the dinnerware made of ?   if the dinnerware is not high fire stoneware ,  porcelain or a china clay body ,  forget it .   if you plan to use it then you are wasting your money .   someone should be ashamed
bought the vacuum on oct 1 2005 .   brought it back to the store on oct 7th .  the belt broke !  thought it was a fluke .  tried one more .  .  . brought it back after 10 days .   a piece went flying after using the hose .  the suction on the hose then did not work !   overall the cleaning was great .  .  .  .  while it worked .
unfortunately ,  i've ordered more than my share of foodsaver products ,  having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage ,   despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers .what many of them claim is very much to the point :  plastic containers frequently develop cracks and loss of vacuum .   i've had many of their marinators and storage canisters prove defective after less than 10 uses .   it seems to be related to the material properties and container size characteristics .   the smaller containers seem to last longer .  those with thick walls relative to the specified volume or reinforcing structures seem to last just a bit longer .in plain language ,  the plastic containers are unreliable .   foodsaver should develop materials and designs that can handle the stress of the vacuum cycling placed on them ,  or quit the the business .   since their products have been on the market for many years ,  i can only assume they are more interested in recruiting new customers than satisfying existing customers .  if you like filling out warranty forms every few weeks ,  more power to you .bottle sealers are equally worthless .   every one that i bought lost vacuum in short order .   in one case ,  a defective seal resulted in a spill of cooking oil that damaged a nylon tent and other camping gear .foodsaver has done a good job with certain items in their product line .   the vacuum unit is well designed and performs reliably ,  as long as the instuctions are followed .   the bagging system is unassailable ,  even though the cost of the bags and rolls is quite high  ( read consumer reports reviews )  .   and ,  to be fair ,  their universal lids are excellent .   use them to seal  small glass jars or stainless steel bowls ,  and there is no loss of vacuum due to cracked plastic .bottom line ?   be careful which products you buy .   some are excellent ,  while others are pure junk .
it doesn't break ,  chip ,  or even discolor ,  but the base has a compound kick  ( depression on the outside and protrusion on the inside .   this makes a very messy exit from the dishwasher and precludes removal of debris on the inside .why hasn't any one noticed ?  where's the reviews ?  i own a dishwasher  ( gee- )  and this is a very irritating function-having to drain the glass ,  dry again ,  and place in my cabinent-geez !don't buy it unless you have maids and butlers .   the again don't buy it because they'll get miffed too !
why do manufacturers always have to change a good thing ?i had a rival crockpot for over 12 years .   it always worked great .   the idea behind a crockpot is to cood slow and low .   my old rival cooked at 150 degrees on the  " low "  setting .i use the old rival all the time ,  and decided to get a second one so i could use them both simutaneouly and cook two recipes at the same time .   i looked at the reviews for the electronic rival models .   everyone said they cooked too hot .   so i finally purchased this 6 . 5 quart model with the simple knob control .well ,  i filled the crockpot full of 8 lb . s of chicken .   the next morning ,  i could smell the burning food .   i looked in the pot ,  and the chicken was boiling on the  " low "  setting .so ,  the next night i filled it full of a vegetable soup recipe .   the next morning ,  the soup was boiling over  .  .  .  again on the  " low "  setting .   the veggies were overcooked and mushy .   i measured the temperature and it was 195 degrees .i won't buy anymore rival products .   i only gave this 2 stars because i guess you could conceivably use it to make soup  .  .  .  if you're willing to stand over it and turn it off when it starts to overboil
airbake products are horrible !  i have used the cookie sheets multiple times and i have had nothing but problems .  there products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans .  i have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than airbake .  buyer beware !  if you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature
we bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped .   we looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task .out of shear frustration we ended up selecting this black & decker .   at first it seemed  " ok "  ,  but after just a few months we are back to using our old  " manual - hand wind "  opener .   the reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes .   over time  ( not much time !  )  it gets too loose to hold a can anymore .   we lock it in place ,  it spins an inch or two and the can drops onto the counter .   repeat this scene over and over .  .  .  !   at the end ,  the lid is never  ( repeat - never !  )  separated from the can - ever !it's back to the hand held and a search of a decent electric continues
rating should be  " 0 "  but that wasn't a choice .   i ordered this item at beginning of july pending move to a place that didn't have a dishwasher .   they backordered it until august 10 .   so i waited and didn't have sanitized dishes in the meantime for myself and my 12 pets .   then ,  on august 9 ,  they sent me an email saying  " we can't get this item ,  we're cancelling the order .  "   i have gone 5 weeks without a dishwasher !   now i have to go find another online store to order from .   target may advertise the cheapest price but they don't deliver
i get this thing and they forget to tell you about the big bulky power cord its impossible to feed the fish and a number of other problems
the interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use .  it got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil .  a lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains ,  but the pan never got its new look back
the cutting boards are not silicone but have a thin layer of silicone sprayed over one side of another plastic that is not heat resistant .   i placed a hot pan on one and it melted onto the bottom of the pan which took a great deal of effort to clean the melted plastic off so the pan could be used again .   i prefer a thick cutting board so i bought these thinking that they were heat resistant so i wouldn't purchase them again
there are only two mixers on the shaft .   as a result it is very difficult to mix the ice cream into a thick milk shake
while the combined grinding and making of the coffee in one unit is a great idea ,  the mess that it created was a pain to clean up each day .   the grounds would get caked in on all three removal parts and each part needed to be cleaned before using again .   i had the product three months and it quit working .   the good thing is that when we call cuisinart's 800 number ,  they told us to just return the item to the store that we purchased it at and we got our money back .
definitely not up to typical cuisinart standards .  while the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup ,  it's relatively thin .  in a 400 degree oven ,  the pan actually bows .look elsewhere for your roaster
i've had 2 polder thermometers and both of them have had a very short life span .   don't waste your money
i was really looking forward to receiving this ,  but four weeks after purchasing online ,  i received an email from amazon saying they did not have a supplier for my purchase !   i am disappointed in amazon .   how can you sell something you do not have
i wish i had .  this one goes to the goodwill .  grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean .  grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular ,  like a chicken breast .  hamburgers work best .  watch out for burns
i folowed the instructions and found that the coffee was very weak so i experimented with differint grinds and filter no filter .  i found not useing the paper filter and grinding the coffee expresso and stoping the water when it starts to look pale makes a med .  strong cup .  a lot of work for a decent cup .  i still think that my old krups drip makes a great cup .  i will keep trying other alternets to the pods becous there very expensive .  i am waiting for some one to start manufacturing a home pod maker .  that you can fill & seel at home
my husband sweats a lot at night and i thought this would stop the problem .   it didn't at all .   it doesn't seems like it does anything for me either .   it just feels like a normal mattress pad .   not exactly worth the price for a normal mattress pad
wish i had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before i purchased this .  i went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years .   after it got the new plastic taste out of it ,  it made good coffee .  even without the brita filter .   just like all the reviewers indicated ,  the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully .   unfortunately ,  it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months .   the seller ,  etronics ,  is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period .   that will be the last thing i buy through them .   like uhh ,  since they sell braun , one would think they would have some recourse through braun and try to help their customers .   so ,  here i am between the proverbial rock and a hard place ,   try to find a braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced ,  or just bite the bullet an go buy another .   ( want to bet it won't be a braun ?  )  additionally ,  what do we do for coffee in the mean time ?   such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet
i bought one of these to make bagna cauda ,  and upon loading the necessary ingredients and depressing the  " high "  button ,  it sparked and died .  well ,  ok ,  i guess it only *half* died ,  as the  " pulse "  button would still work ,  if i leaned on it with my entire weight ,  but both the  " high "  and  " low "  switch settings did nothing .  so i'm thinking next time i'll spend a little more ;  meanwhile ,  this little guy goes back
i would have given this no stars but it won't let me .  this non-stick griddle has more things stick to it than tape .   it is simply the worst product i have purchased in a long time .   i have this  " non-stick "  griddle for just about a month and it is ready for the trash .   the non-stick is coming up on the flat end and the griddle is worthless ,  it ripped my chicken cutlets to shreds .   don't buy it !  !  !  if you read this and still buy it may you have three horrible meals like i did before it met the old trash can
i bought these classes earlier today because they are attractive and inexpensive .   i placed them in the dishwasher to clean them all prior to use ,  and one was cracked and a small fragment of glass had broken away after the cycle was done .   i then checked amazon's reviews ,  and found that this was a common experience .   they're going back to the store tomorrow .
the blade broke after 14 months of use .   and to take advantage of the warranty ,  i learned that i was required to send them a check for $4 . 00 for processing costs ,  not to mention the cost that i would incurr to ship it to them .   it was an adequate grinder at best ,  so i'm definitely not going to bother returning it  ( i assume that this is cuisinart's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place )  .   i wonder if the rest of their product line is like this .   until now ,  i thought cuisinart was a name you could trust .   i'm very disappointed
have been wanting to get the pasta roller attachment and ran accross this plastic pasta maker at the store .   was really excited since it was in my price range .   took it home and tried to use it .   my kitchenaid mixer starting smoking and so i let it rest for the hour .   upon removing the attachment i found oil and black rubber or grease was all over the inside of the attachment .   ( on the coil thing that pushes the dough through )  next time i wanted to use my mixer to beat egg whites it had no power .   i sure hope this inexpensive attachment didn't ruin my wonderful mixer .   highly disappointed with kitchenaid on this attachment
amazon seems to experience a disproportionate number of  " pricing errors "  .   whenever you attempt to purchase anything at amazon that represents a 50% or higher discount ,  don't expect to receive it .   poor business practices
i just received my set .  the glasses are so .  .  .  beautiful !  yet ,  5 out of 6 are defective !  !  what a big disappointment !  i have been looking forward to receiving my first riedel .  .  .  . amazon . com provides great deal which i got $80 for 6 glasses ,  but they were obviously factory seconds !  so disappointed !  however ,  the design of the glass are beautiful !  !  i am still returning them !  so sad !  .  .  .  .  .  .    :
i got one with my foodsaver .     i like the foodsaver but their canisters crack after a couple of uses .    also the manufacture is not handy friendly .    i was injured and can't speak .     when i tried to get help  by email they told me i needed to get friend or family member to call them if i wanted help .    that just wrong .    i guess they haven't heard about the equal access laws
i was excited to upgrade to this coffee grinder after years of using a cheap krups model ,  and i have to say that i am very disappointed with the way this machine grinds coffee .  it takes way too long to grind ,  whether pulsing or grinding continuously .  and then the grounds are very uneven .  although the manufacturer says it is grinding slowly to keep the flavor in ,  every coffee expert i've consulted with says the longer coffee grinds ,  the more it heats up and the more flavor is lost .  even after long grinding ,  there are large pieces of bean still visible .  i was also excited about the machine's detachable bowl ,  which does make for easy cleaning .  but only of the bowl .  the rest of the machine is a pain to clean and no matter how carefully you remove the top ,  your counter is covered in grounds .  i bought a second bowl so that i could grind spices in the same machine ,  and i think the coffee grinder works better on spices and seeds  ( such as flax )  than it does on coffee .  but you still have to clean the entire thing before reusing it ,  or your spices have a strong coffee flavor from the grounds that are stuck to the protective case .   ( that plastic case does make grinding quieter ,  however .  )  all in all i'm quite disappointed with this purchase .  i should have gone farther upscale and gotten a more serious burn grinder ,  or stuck with my cheap krups with the slanted bowl base which made even grounds quickly .
i was given mr .  bento as a gift last summer .  i was so excited !  i bring a lunch to work every day ,  and i thought mr .  bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well-organized ,  balanced ,  and easy-to-carry lunch .  you can imagine my dismay when the mr .  bento containers leaked day after day .  anything remotely soft came out from the containers ,  which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way .  cute ?  yes .  impress your co-workers ?  yes .  but practical ?  no .
i agree with the previous reviewer that these are difficult to clean and dry .   i could never get mine really clean so i threw them out
i have tried and tried but the thing just makes weak coffee .i don't know how many different pods i have tried but the thing just can't make a strong cup .  i have tried 2 pods - i have even tried making my own pods .  if you try to jam too much coffee in it ,  it leaks and will try to pop it's head off .i have not done the proper  " priming "  that folks have mentioned and i also have detected a bit of a metalic flavor so that may be associated with my lack of effort .am going to try to return it because it is just too expensive to make a wimpy cupa joe
when i bought my first littermaid box ,  i thought it was a miracle -- no more scooping !  hooray !  it worked so well for my four cats that a few months later ,  i bought a second one .  unfortunately ,  the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks  ( and i'd thrown the receipt away ,  so i couldn't get my money back )  .  soon after that ,  the original box quit working ,  too .  so ,  within about 6 months ,  i spent close to $200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned .after researching better and more reliable options ,  i've settled on the omega paw box that you roll to clean .  i now have three of them -- no electric parts to break ,  and ,  actually ,  less mess than the littermaid
after reading the reviews here saying that the chemical smell mentioned by others was not a problem for them ,  i went ahead and ordered this rice cooker .   after i received the cooker ,  i was a little disappointed to find that it was made in china ,  rather than japan ,  and that there were some very noticeable imperfections in the fit and finish .i made sure to remove the shipping paper under the pot ,  and wash the pot and lid thoroughly ,  but upon trying it out i was disappointed to find that my cooker did in fact emit an acrid chemical smell that filled my apartment .   it was the kind of smell that you more feel in your nose than actually smell .   the smell also flavored the rice ,  which was most noticeable after letting it cool and airing out the apartment .  aside from this problem ,  though ,  the rice ,  which was standard japanese style white short grain ,  came out perfectly .i returned this cooker and ordered the panasonic sr-na18 ,  which should arrive tomorrow .   i have compared a few rice cookers at my local asian store ,  and this panasonic model seems better built than the newer  ( i believe )  panasonic sr-la18 ,  plus i believe it is made in japan  ( i'll have to check when mine arrives )  .   i also highly recommend the zojirushi 10-cup  " neuro fuzzy "  model  ( ns-jcc18/ns-zcc18 )  .   my parents have had one for several years and it works perfectly
i purchased this as a christmas gift for my mother .   i was very excited when it arrived much sooner than i had anticipated .   i opened it up ,  so that i could give it to my mom assembled .   unfortunately ,  an entire corner was broken off and the other corner was cracking and splintering .   the packing materials are insufficient to say the least .   i immediately called target's customer service ,  and the operator very graciously assisted me in returning my table .   despite my dissapointment about the broken table i was glad that target did the best they could to resolve my issue without any hassle .   &#60 ; br /&#62 ;&#60 ; br /&#62 ;
the tea kettle is inexpensive ,  but i'd spend more to get a tea kettle that whistles and also has a top that flips open from the handle instead of one where you have to manually pop it off .   in addition ,  the handle gets hot ,  and you need an oven mitt to hold it
i've had this toaster for four years now .  it just started going down hill recently .-it started toasting too darkly on the settings i had consistently used for years .-the digital setting knob no longer works ,  it is stuck on 4 .-it only shuts off when manually popped up .i have to agree with other reviews that said it doesn't toast very even .  i've noticed this in my four years of use .so if your willing to pay the price for it to last 4 years get it .  if not ,  try another with better reviews
box arrived damaged .  opened product ,  scratched on front ,  dirty on the inside .  after i cleaned it up it worked great for a week then  " poof "  .  no power at all .  thought i may have ran it too much so i left it unplugged for 24 hours then plugged it back in and nothing .  additionally customer service for edgestar is terrible .  i have left 10 voicemails and sent approx 14 e-mails back and forth with their customer service  ( haha )  reps and still have made zero progress .  buy with caution
i am a man who loves his tea .   i drink up to a dozen cups a day ,  so i use my tea ball quite frequently .   my major complaint with most tea balls ,  and the reason i must always replace them is that eventually the clip begins to not fasten securely .   over time this gets worse ,  and the tea ball becomes unusable .   there are other balls with clips that are a bit more sturdy .i just got this tea ball in the mail a week ago ,  and while it is still usable ,  the clip is already losing its grip .   look somewhere else for a tea ball .
i love to grill but i keep my grill a fair distance from my house while cooking so you can imagine the excitment i had in purchasing this item with the wireless transmitter .   first ,  it took more than 1/2 an hour to get the two pieces to communicate with each other .   secondly ,  and worst of all ,  on just my second attempt using it i was watching my pork roast temperature from the comfort of my kitchen when the temperature value jumped to  " high "  .   i immediately went out to check it and the probe is dead !  !  !   there's no way to purchase a replacement probe so the whole thing is just a fancy kitchen timer !  !   taylor is no help !
this worked great .  .  . for 5 minutes .  i tried everything to make it work again over three days .  i finally contacted customer service and they said there is nothing else to do - send it to them and they will replace it .  i'm glad they were responsive ,  but now i have to pay to ship the darn thing to michingan
this product did not even approach what was described .   a bagutte pan needs to have a decent-sized curvature so a bagutte shape will be obtained .   this pan would have produced a fairly flat loaf
as shannon says ,  kitchenaid mixer bowl covers are terrific for storing food and attachments .   but be warned :  these particular covers may not fit your mixer bowl !   i purchased a new artisan mixer &amp ;  ordered these to go along with it ,  but they are too small .   they do not fit the artisan or ksm90 mixer bowls .   models they fit are kbc5n ,  k5ss ,  &amp ;  ksm5 only
after operating the petmate fresh flow cat fountain for a month my 2 cats won't go anywhere near it .   very disappointing !
i bought this air cleaner in march of 03 and was pleased with the thing until it just stopped working in january 04 .   there was no indication that anything was amiss ,  i was changing the pre-filters on the recommended schedule and then one morning nothing ;  no lights ,  no sound ,  no activity .   am sending it back to honeywell  ( on my nickel according to their warranty policy )  .   we will see how long the replacement lasts .   i have read several reviews here that don't give me much hope .   amazon was nice ,  said i needed to contact honeywell directly but suggested i post a review
i loved this iron until it died after owning it for a little over a year .   i bought this iron because consumer reports rated it #1 .  it was a great iron while it worked .    ( i iron about once a week - sometimes twice a month .  )   i've had irons last for years and i usually get rid of them because they lack the bells and whistles not because they fail to work .  black & decker customer service acted like i was the only one whoever had a problem with one of their products and told me to go buy another iron because it was over a year old .   i'm sorry ,  but i think with light use ,  an iron should last more than a year .   forget black & decker .  i'm trying rowenta or bosch
i have always had a percolator so having cuisinart products and another percolator by them i ordered this one .   i received it the first of sept .  2006 and on nov .  10 plugged it in ,  it sparked at the pot and that was it gone !  !  i am sick about this as i had thought cuisinart was a step above the rest
i purchased a 14-cup cuisinart some years ago .   i have had nothing but trouble .   first the handle stuck while i was kneading dough and i barely was able to pry it off .   then i had problems with the stem .   when i tried to get a new one from customer service they told me that they were no longer servicing my older model and suggested i buy a new cuisinart !   stay away from cuisinart !   i'm looking into kitchen aid for my new processor
this sharpener seemed to work well ,  but that was before i noticed it was putting chips in the edge of the knife
i bought the capresso 114 last december  ( the difference being ,  the model 112 has chrome trim and a very questionable milk reservoir )  .  this machine is unbelievably finicky ;  you must use an extremely coarse grind  ( according to the manual )  ,  and almost zero tamping pressure  ( again ,  according to the manual )  ,  otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow  ( several minutes for a shot of espresso )  .  even when you get everything according to instructions  ( which includes ,  according to capresso tech support ,  disassembling the machine every few days )  ,  it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso ,  which comes out weak ,  bitter ,  and with no crema .  after two months of discussing this with capresso tech support and getting nowhere ,  i returned the machine to amazon .  after that i bought a krups xp 4000 -- bliss !  the machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds ,  even with a fine grind and firm tamp .
i purchased this unit due to the fact that you could dispense without a coffee pot .  in the past i have usually ended up breaking the glass carafe that comes along with traditional coffee makers .  at first ,  i was very pleased with the unit and thought i made a great purchase .  eventually it started to drip and leak at random .  the handle in the water/coffee holder broke .  the top of the unit that lifts up broke off completely and now just sort of sits there precariously .  finally ,  this week it decided that it was not going to work at all .  it will not make coffee .  it will turn on ,  but not brew .  i have only had this for a year and a half or so .  look elsewhere if you are looking for something that is going to last .   ( it was only used 2-3 times a week
usually oxo produces well designed items that have you thinking &quot ; they *really* thought about how this thing was going to be used  ( and abused )  ! &quot ;   unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles .   it's a shame ,  but you should pass on these
tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice ,  i was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently .   no such luck with this one !  first ,  it uses a different measuring system for the rice  (  " rice cooker cup "  ) than it does for the water  (  " regular measuring cup "  )  ,  so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again !  worse though ,  is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed ,  so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam .  for those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great .  one might figure out how to adjust the measuring ,  but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output .  since water boils at the same temperature ,  fast or slow ,  it makes no sense .yet another gripe is that it automatically goes into  " warm "  mode when it is finished .  may be handy to have the warm option ,  but if you don't realize it's done and its left on  " warm "  for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab .it seems very well made ,  and handsome bau-haus design ,  but unfotrtunately i can't use it because of the above problems .others' experience may vary .  keep in mind i'm very good at ruining rice .  i just don't need help doing it !david
maybe i just have stains that are too much for it ,  but this cleaner didn't seem to do very much ,  certainly not enough to warrant paying the extra for it versus normal cleaners .  and i'm not using it on very old le creuset either ,  everything i have is less than a year old .  maybe it does better on older stains !
wonderful pan ,  but the handles get very warm since it is oven-proof  -  wish it was broiler proof
i bought this teapot from amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times .   the material is great ,  heat retention is good ,  it looks very nice ,  and i had no problems cleaning it  ( i use a babybottle brush )  .the tea infuser is not very effective though .   the holes are a bit on the large side ,  so any broken bits from whole tea leaves can still pass through .   and the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves ,  especially when i'm not planning to fill the pot to the brim  ( it doesn't extend deep enough )  .   so i don't use it at all  ( i put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as i pour )  .however ,  my biggest gripe is that the spout does tend to dribble after you pour .   so you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours ,  ending up with a wet spot on your table/counter .   i have to make sure i either wipe the spout in between pours ,  or set it on a dishtowel/paper napkin  ( unless i'm planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session )  .   i found that pretty annoying .so in conclusion ,  for the price i paid for this teapot's supposedly wonderful features ,  i don't think it was a good buy .
product not even worth a penny .  impossible to use after the first wash .  . wont recommend to anyon
the battery is way below standard ,  extremely disappointing .  it's cheaper to buy another machine than to replace it
i purchased the cuisinart grinder from amazon based upon customer reviews just over two years ago after trying two cheaper $20-ish models picked up at local discount stores .   motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order ;  the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2-3 months in a storage building .  the motor on the cuisinart is still going strong ,  but i had to trash it today .   i have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1-3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight ,   but that's to be expected with a blade grinder .   the on/off button broke about 2 months ago ;  then ,  last week ,  the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite john conti beans .   others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models ,  but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee !   if i don't try a higher quality burr grinder ,  i may get another one of these !
i am a trained research assistant ;  therefore ,  i try to research products before i purchase them .   in the case of this purchase ,  i saw the item during an early bird sale at kohls ,  so i grabbed it .   i owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness ,  but it is really bulky ,  so i thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice .   on the contrary ,  it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse ,  and although it was on sale ,  it was a waste of money .   the problems i had were :1 .   the cord is too short :  directions instruct user to hang nozzle on the door hook which hangs over the top of any door .   the nozzle would not reach to the top of the door ,  and i live in a mobile home ,  so it is not like i have the tallest doors in a home .2 .   the most important thing in steaming a garment ,  for me ,  is to avoid the garment getting wet .   i did not fill the steamer to the maximum line ,  because i know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect .   after 2 minutes of waiting for the steam ,  i began to try it out on a silk blouse ,  and what a big mistake i made .   the water spat out on the material .   i thought that i should not hold the nozzle so close ,  but it did not matter ,  because water continued to spit out on the blouse .3 .   the steam pressure would not dewrinkle the blouse .   the is not a case where the material was so hard to dewrinkle ;  it is silk ,  not that hard of a material .i have read other reviews ,  and if this machine worked for them ,  i don't know how ,  but i can attest to the operation of the steamer that i purchased .   i dabble in selling clothing on another website ,  and i have owned my other steamer since 2002 ,  and i will continue to use it ;  i will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home .   conair gs4 compact is a bust .
this attachment vibrates so badly that it about bounces the food processor right off the counter .   i love the food processor but i regret having bought the juice extractor
these are plastic-y ,  one cracked after 2nd washing ,  they look like the little fish bowls from the county fair ,  so big you have to use 2 hands to prevent sloshing it all over yourself    :
if you're in the market for a used nissan coffee mug ,  then step right up and order from amazon . com !so you're probably thinking ,  yes ,  maybe i would like a used coffee mug .   how about a used coffee mug with dried ,  brown coffee stains still in it .  .  . and how about with the fresh aroma of a .  .  . what does that smell like ,  ah ,  vanilla latte i believe it is .if you're still interested ,  continue ordering ,  but be advised as customer service will be unwilling to compensate you for any issues you may have with receiving a dirty mug in the mail .   i think nissan stainless makes a nice product ,  but i wouldsuggest ordering from somewhere else !  !  !hip ,  hip ,  boooooo
although i love the way it clips onto the oven rack ,  and it's very easy to read ,  it took about 15-20 minutes to  " register "  the temperature of the oven .
my salter 1001 scale started having problems within 3 months and broke within 10 months .   i am sending the scale back to saltier for replacement .   a good scale while it worked ,  but what pain this has become
i bought this and some other pans in the set .   very disappointed .   i have a glass cooktop ,  and when the pans heat up ,  they warp .  then return to their normal shape when they cool down .  guess i got what i paid for
we had registered for all-clad pans for our wedding last year ,  and decided to go with a calphalon commercial nonstick set instead .   the person helping us highly recommended the calphalon one infused anodized set instead ,  and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic .   we bought that set and have had it for nearly a year .   we hardly ever use it ,  however ,  because things stick so badly ,  even with oil .   while the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and bar keeper's friend ,  i'm very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it
it is really the worst coffee maker i had .  it is too slow ,  the automatic stopper always breakes and the coffee pot is useless ,  because you can not pour in a cup without making a mes
it looks like a krups -- what with the stainless steel look and the fancy electronics ,  but ,  as a rice cooker ,  it does not  perform as expected .   the rice is passable but certainly not the best we've had - our very old national rice cooker produced better rice .   also disappointing is the lack of a retractable electrical cord - winding the electrical cord around a chintzy metal cord holder  ( unstrategically located at the bottom of the cooker )  gets old very quickly .   lastly ,  the fancy electronic display is not very informative when cooking rice .    ( it may be more helpful when using the appliance as a slow cooker - but we thought we were buying a rice cooker .  )bottom line :  it looks like a krups ,  does not perform like one ,  and ,  with all its good looks ,  is decidedly un-ergonomic in its design .   a disappointment .   if we could ,  we'd return it .
have to say  " ditto "  to all the reviewers below--i owned another brand before but it wasn't nearly as powerful .   at least one reviewer expresses concern about keeping the blades clean ,  so i must note that the instructions indicate everything but the motor housing--which detaches from the blade element--can go in the dishwasher !
i purchased this blanket because i loved the color .   that is the only thing it has going for it .   there were feathers all over the place and i keep finding random ones in rooms on different floors !   it is now stored in an airtight bag because i can't toss it- i paid good money for it
i was not happy with this item at all .   the pillowcases are really thin and after washing and drying them ,  they are extremely wrinkled .   they also had  " pills "  on them after washing them before they were even used .   very unsatisfactory
i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best .   only problem is that they rust !  !  !   i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior .   i don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot ,  so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times .   the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so ,  but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic .i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn't last long at all .   i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot
this is very misleading .  this item is only half of the package .  after its delivered you will find that you must also order more parts to make it work .  very disappointed in amazon for allowing this
i am sorry to say that i was not satisfied with this pan at all !   the cakes i bake are browning ,  even burning on the edges before the middle is even done !   the edges are rising but the middle is &quot ; slumping&quot ;  down .   i own the calphalon cookware and that is nice but they have a stinker in their bakeware .   my recommendation= look at a different pan
i have had this gadget for a little over a year as we got it as a wedding gift .   i had not used it as it did not seem worth the trouble to plan on getting it out ahead of time and charging it for 15 hours when i could use a manual grater right when i needed it .   last week ,  i needed to shred some cheddar for a recipe .   i read the instructions front to back ,  allowed it to charge the full amount of time ,  and i was pretty excited when it came time to try it out .   right from the start ,  i knew it was junk .   you are supposed to be able to lift the piece of plastic up and have it stay in the up position while you change the blade .   not mine .   the plastic piece kept coming off ,  and dozens of tries to keep it upright resulted in dozens of failures .   i decided to look past that and judge purely on the shredding ability .   once i started trying to grate ,  i had a really hard time getting the thing to shred .   i tried varying degrees of pressure .   as others commented ,  the cheese does get stuck everywhere .   then ,  the cheese that does come out is in tiny little shreds .   i did not get the nice big shreds that i am used to with my manual grater .   my husband thought i was doing it wrong ,  so he tried it .   he had the same result .   i will not even sell this at a rummage sale or give it to goodwill ,  because people are better off without it .   since it was a gift ,  i'm glad i'm not out any money .   it is going in the trash
i had a littermaid a couple of years ago that lasted me for a year and did great .  i am not sure what is wrong with this type we had it for a whole week then it stopped working .  do yourself a favor and do not get this
this was an excellent item .  .  . for about 3 uses .  .  . then the mandoline would not hold to one thickness .  .  . it keeps opening up to maximum cut depth .    miu france says this is not their problem .  .  .  " just buy a new one "  .   with an attitude like that .  .  . and product failure so quickly .  .  .  .  . yes ,  i will buy a different brand .  .  . and avoid miu france product
sometimes it sprays when she barks ,  most of the time it doesn't .  so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low .  it's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog .  i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine .   ( my children found this amusing .
everything sticks to these pans !  i cannot get off the potato residue and i'm probably just going to throw them away .they are awkwardly heavy .  they do not warp ,  but they do pop out of shape  ( this happens when the pans are in the oven and you'll hear a very loud ,  scary pop )  .just awful .
worked great the first couple of times .   i didn't keep it on the charger for 24 hours  ( not realizing that this is a problem )  and now the battery only works for 10 minutes at a time .   it's now basically worthless
after checking the calphalon web site the suggested retail price for model r1384  14 "  everyday pan is $160 . 00 .i am dissapointed that this is not a true discounted price .
i purchased this after looking at all of the reviews .  what a mistake !  after using this to cook single cup servings of several types of rice ,  there was one thing in common - a huge mess .  even after rinsing the raw rice several times ,  the unit still spatters out to about a two foot radius .  i may try it with a wet dish towel on top to contain the mess ,  or i may just stick it in the basement and forget about it
i bought this because it had such good reviews .  .  .  i got one and used it a few times perfectly without problems .  until it blew up in the microwave .  yep ,  blew up .  now im sure i did everything as i was meant to .  .  so i really am being objective about this review .  .what can i say ?  this was my experience ,  ive decided to buy a more reliable egg cooker which does not involve the microwave .  .
the first dolce item i purchased was the wine tower and i have been very happy with that piece .   however ,  the coffee table and end tables all arrived with cracks .   the coffee table was not glued together properly and was misaligned .   not pleased at all and way too costly to ship back
yes ,  it is pretty .  no ,  it is not a good teapot .  i have made tea for over 40 years ,  in all sorts of pots ,  and this is right up there with the worst .  it drips a lot !  perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout .  and no ,  it does not drip from the spout .  rather ,  lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot .   this happens with both fast and slow pouring ,  with full and near empty pots .   this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot .  just too much mopping up
i just received this knife yesterday &amp ;  am sending it back for a refund .   upon first use ,  the forked metal tip broke off when i was chopping tomatoes for a salad .   it took me a few moments to notice the lost tip  ( as it had ended up in the salad i was preparing .  )   could have been very dangerous to swallow a sharp metal tip !   the knife itself is flimsy ,  can't imagine that it could cut a bagel very well
i've been using a large cusinart for over 10 years .   it is marvelous ,  so i decided to get the mini-mate chopper for smaller jobs .wrong idea !  !   this is a horrible little machine .   it won't grind more than a couple of seeds at a time & forget chopping !   the grinding unit won't rotate most of the time .it's going to the salvation army as a donation .
after cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan ,  i'm sad to say that my non-stick pan sticks .   we've had this pan for maybe 8 months and i just assumed that pans lasted for several years .   we even bought this pan plus the 8 "  for my mother-in-law for christmas .   what a disappointment .   better begin research on a new pan .  .  . and i'll make sure to read the reviews .
threw it in the trash !   it was awful !  !   horrible to clean ,  didn't chop right .   pass on this one !  !   bought an unknown brand for $9 . 99 and love it
i saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one .   that was several years ago .   finally ,  our beloved brewstation gave up the ghost and went on to coffeeland in the sky .   so ,  i promptly bought another one .   morning is just not the same without our brewstation
i bought two sets to take advantage of the free shipping ,  despite the low reviews .   ( i plan to buy good sheets once they go on clearance at the end of the season .  .  .  )  when i took one set out of the package there was already a hole in it .  amazon replaced them ,  but when i washed them they feel like they are going to fall apart .  the filled up the lint collector .  i have red and green lint everywhere ,  even after washing them .  you get what you pay for
you look at them in a picture frame .  .  .  .  . the fish are crammed in there
the waffle baker  ( formerly waffle iron )  works great .  make that 'worked great . ' for an entire month ,  then it died .  it was ,  of course ,  under warranty .  no problem ,  we were told ,  we will ship a new one to your door .great !  we thought .  that was three months ago .  the latest is the honchos see no reason to hurry (  !  )  our replacement .  customer service is hoping -- not guaranteeing ,  not promising ,  but hoping -- we will get our replacement in mid-january .if ,  and it is a very big 'if' ,  we get our replacement in january ,  that will make the score 5 to 1 against us .  for six months they will have had our money ,  and for one month of the six we will have had a functioning waffle baker .it would seem that it is difficult to do much worse than buy a waffle baker that dies after a month with no replacement on the horizon .great when it works ,  but it doesn't work ,  so how many stars is it really worth ?  2 ?  1 ?  none ?  a negative number ?and it really was a great toy .  drat !
i purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it's too cold to be outside .   it looks very nice and clean up is super easy .   the problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it .the first time i used it ,  i grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan ,  i had no problem with smoke .this is great ,  i thought .    the next time i grilled hamburger patties and even though i followed the same procedure as before ,  it smoked up my whole house .   ( these were not high fat content burgers either )   i added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more .   it was not a pleasant experience .   right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until i decide to give it one more try .   if it fairs better next time i will return and give it a better review .  . maybe
like most reviewers ,  i found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist .   like a number of other reviewers ,  i found that one of my glasses leaked .   unlike one other reviewer ,  i was unable to eliminate the water between the glass' walls in the microwave ,  and when i tried to do so the glass became very hot because of the steam produced .   to my mind ,  elegance of form can never compensate for a failure of functional design .   5 stars for form ,  1 star for function :   2 stars total .addendum :   i liked the form of these glasses so much that i bought two more at my local coffee house ,  knowing that if either leaked i could easily return it .   neither did ,  and they're a pleasure to use .   i recommend local ,  rather than web ,  purchase
this is clearly a case of  " you get what you pay for "  .  for easy jobs this mixer works fine ,  but give it a thick batch of brownie mix or cookie dough and the motor will just di
had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction  ( it locked but would not unlock )  .   amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly .   however ,  the lock on the second one does not work properly ,  either  ( it doesn't lock )  ,  though i will keep it ,  since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home .  this item is a good way of storing blades and disks ,  but unless cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism ,  don't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it .
cup leaks out of the top closure part .  i need one that does not leak at all ,  most of the time my hands are full and it's a balancing act .  very disappointed for this amount of money it is not worth the aggravation
look ,  the product plainly reads  " oster blender blade with gasket "  and the package that was delivered is titled  " processing unit with sealing ring "  .   the blade was in the package but there was no sealing ring/gasket to be found .   i'm sure there is the possibility that i got the one defective package off the line but what kind of quality assurance is that ?  !   i'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this product but just be aware that you may have a problem .   i now need to buy a whole separate gasket which maybe costs all of $1 . 50 and will pay shipping of probably $3 .
this sifter broke a month after i got it .  it seems sturdy but it actually requires carefull handling .  the sifting is somewhat slow but good  ( excercise !  !  !  )
i purchased this product 4 years ago and have replaced the probe three times for about $7 each .  the latest probe just malfunctioned .   i really loved it at first .  .  . perfectly roasted chickens , loin roasts ,  and turkeys .   oddly enough ,  the thermometer works great but the probe itself isn't designed to handle much time in the oven .   if you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven  , the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable .   even at lower temperatures ,  the heat finally takes its' toll .  .  . it just takes longer for it to happen .   one would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat .   i will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working ,  it is great .   that is worth $7 a year for me .  .  .  . but not for everyone .   per another reviewers advice ,  i am calling polder
i bought both this and the similar version from brookstone this year .   i was expecting a lot from the metrokane ,  but it turns out the brookstone is much better .   it's $60 ,  but the brookstone version will last you much longer than the $45 metrokane .among the differences :  the metrokane is made of plastic ,  the brookstone is metal .   the brookstone model comes with two bottle sealers ,  and it's case is made of very high quality leather-like material instead of cheap plastic .   finally ,  my metrokane is brand new ,  and i've already managed to scratch the finish ,  since it's so cheap .if you're looking to get a new wine opener ,  do yourself a favor and buy another brand
i've purchased several different rotary graters and this one had the same result as many of it's other plastic siblings .   it too broke within 2 days of use .   these plastic graters just aren't built with much strength and should not be used with harder cheeses ,  or by someone who has a strong grip .   the common defect i'm finding in plastic graters is how the rotating arm is attached to the drum .   the tiny amount of plastic there isn't desined to withstand shearing forces which is what rotates the drum .when i find a good rotary cheese grater ,  i'll write a review on it
i bought this coffee maker ,  because some people gave it high recommendation here .  i think i wasted my money .it worked only for a couple of days .  finally ,  it just stopped working and i had to push the button at least three times in order to collect a small cup of coffee .  that is ridiculous for an expensive coffee maker priced at $80 above .  it makes me feel that this japanese coffee maker is like sony-made products ,  having a fancy looking but lousy quality .save your money for some other coffe makers ,  and avoid this one
mine worked reasonably well for about 7 months ;  then stopped switching itself off and eventually overheated the plastic bulkhead which holds the coil ,  giving off a strong  ( presumably toxic )  odour of melted plastic ,  also affecting the taste of the water .  amazon does not sell this item in britain ,  where it would never get through the safety tests required by consumer legislation ,  but apparently they are quite happy to put american lives in danger
there's hardly any suction .  i applied a full tank of cleaner on the carpet  ( which requires a little effort one squirt at a time )  ,  but it only sucked up a few drops of it .   customer service was helpful and had me return the product
i ,  too ,  bought this terrible piece of equipment .  my complaint ,  aside from the odd taste ,  consistency and smell ,  was that you could not tell when the egg was done .  it was still raw at 10 minutes .  by the time it was cooked you could have used it for a nerf ball .  what a waste of money .  as far as thinking up other purposes for it ,  i suppose it could be a sacrificial camping outdoor firepit cook pan for something .   you'll have to think of something ,  just don't put eggs in it
i received this a shower gift a few years ago .   standard mixer ,  can't do anything too drastic with it ,  but i noticed the last time i took the beaters out of the dishwasher they had rusted .   these are not stainless beaters and they will rust .   i'm in the market for a new mixer
the design is ok .  nothing fancy ,  nothing different ,  it looks just like any other teakettle .  it works fine .  the handle doesn't get hot ,  and the whistle isn't too loud .  i gave it one star because of the black goo that came inside .  i washed it before using it ,  and after the water was done boiling ,  i saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird .  the smell may have been caused by that black stuff .  i washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out .  i took one piece and noticed it was gooey .  i checked if there was something that had melted when i boiled the water ,  but i saw the kettle was intact .  i boiled more water and again i saw the black goo floating in the water .  i have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times ,  and there is still goo floating in the water ,  they are almost unnoticeable ,  like very tiny dots ,  but they are there .  at least the funny smell is gone .  i don't know what that black goo is or what's causing it or where it's coming from .  i'm afraid it may contain dangerous metals or chemicals that can be harmful .  if i keep seeing black goo ,  i'm sending it back .  i think i've learned my lesson .  when it comes to buying cookware ,  it's better to buy good quality .  it's not worth jeopardizing your health to save a few bucks .update :  after washing it two more times and boiling water one more time i got rid of the goo .  and i've noticed that the handle gets very hot when i fill it all the way up
the can has to be 100% dent free for this to work .   if you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can ,  this thing won't open your product .   a great idea ,  but this needed a little more refinement .paper weight in my min
i couldn't wait to get the dyson root 6 - i've had my dyson dc 07 for 4 years and i love it ,  so i figured the mini-version would be fantastic .  i have 3 dustbusters  ( one on each floor )  and i was looking forward to the dyson version ,  which i was convinced would be top notch .i'm so sorry to be wrong .first off ,  having to press the button continuously to make it work is a pain .  and speaking of pain ,  the root is so heavy and unbalanced - all the weight is in the back which puts a lot of strain on your wrist .  i haven't noticed any difference in suction to a dustbuster ,  but then again ,  i don't suck up bowling balls .  a dustbuster picks up lint and cat litter just as well .save your money - this dyson ain't worth it
i myself am not a coffee drinker but after watching the lengths that my husband has gone through to get keep his coffee hot ,  i will agree with other reviewers ,  this delonghi is dewrongi .  my husband has to boil the water in a kettle to pre-heat the carafe before brewing .  if he doesn't get a chance to drink it right away ,  he puts the carafe  ( filled with coffee )  onto the stovetop on low .   well a couple mornings ago ,  we were both rushing around to get the kids off to school and off to work .  without thinking ,  he put the carafe on the burner but must have accidentally cranked it to high heat .  next thing i know i'm screaming from the kitchen because the carafe is on fire with 2 foot flames quickly spreading .  he dumped a pot of cold water on it and hallelujah ,  no damage was done .   ( we are so lucky as we are selling our home in a few months .so after reading the other reviews ,  i'm no longer pursuing a replacement carafe but instead will buy him a whole new machine .  .  . and it won't be a delonghi
the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't !  this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt .  what a useless thing .  i'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor .  this thing certainly doesn't do it !  if you're looking to buy this thing ,  look again -- there must be something better if not just your regular broom
the 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor .  the mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water .  the bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd .  when 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds .  i didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set .  finding everything that i needed and used was more important .  the set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore .  this product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an islan
after using my 3 new circulon pots and lids for only 2 or 3 months ,  all the circulon lids have broken plastic handles ,  including the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan .first noticed the problem when i got gouged by the broken plastic ,  i saw that all three circulon lids showed big chunks of plastic off the underside of the plastic handles .   i am very careful and do not own a dishwasher .next ,  i saw that two of the faulty handles now had big chuncks off both ends of the plastic handles .  all the breakage occured where the plastic 'cool' handle attaches to the metal part of the handle .  just today ,  when i removed the hot lid from my toss and turn pan ,  the black plastic totally came loose from the metal part of the handle !  only fast dancing saved me from this big hot lid falling on my feet .   but at last i saw the flaw .  instead of these lids having a complete metal handle that is covered with the plastic for cool handling ,  the metal part only goes up an inch to meet the plastic .  the black plastic only overlaps the metal part for a scant half inch or so ,  causing the more sturdy metal part to undermine the plastic ,  and eventually causing the chipped plastic to separate from the metal with use .  the lids are subjected to steam and heat on a daily basis ,  so no wonder the plastic broke off ,  the plastic has no backing .  it is just carelessly and poorly attached to less than a half inch of the metal that is attached to the lid .  this poorly conceived construction is why the handle broke away entirely after the plastic was chipped ,  a full metal handle covered with plastic would have been nice for the money spent and prevented the accident where the handle completely separated from the chipped plastic .  there is no metal supporting that plastic folks .my enthusiasm for the circulon was originally quite high ,  but now that i have lidless pots after less than 90 days ,  i'm pretty unhappy !  this chipping happened to 3 out of 3 lids !  and the toss and turn lid is almost as expensive as the toss and turn pan !  now ,  after less than 90 days i must send in the toss and turn lid and my 2 smaller lids with chipped handles that go with the sauce pans .  because the toss and turn handle separated and broke away ,  this is not merely a cosmetic matter .  even before the lid handle broke entirely ,  the broken handles were uncomfortable to use with those sharp broken plastic edges digging into my fingers .  sending these lids back will leave me ill equiped in the kitchen after all the money spent to be well equiped .  further ,  i doubt their replacements will be any better ,  and they will probably need replacement every 90 days !  much as i love the circulon pans ,  these lids make them a bad purchase .  i would not buy this product again .  hopefully this review will help you make a good decision about circulon pans and their bad lids
i agree these sheets are horrible .  .  i should have know better .  .   i have the same issues as every one else does .  .   i dont know what will happen after the second wash .  .  they will proably fit the crib .  .dont waste your money
we thought this was smaller than pictured and not comfortable .   we were not pleased with this
i purchased one like this last december . on the 13th month i owned it it began to leak from the spout . i emailed breville 2-3 times and they never even responded ! their web site states they always respond within 3 days . don't believe them and don't buy a product from this company
this pricey toaster is not worth its weight in bread .   for the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster i have ever owned .   it is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread .   save your money .   do not buy this product
as mentioned in a lot of other reviews ,  my water tank leaks like a sieve .  the unit is completely unusable .  when you see how poorly constructed the water tank is ,  you realize hoover has built a clearly defective product .  save yourself trouble ,  buy another brand of cleaner .  i will never buy a hoover product again
zyliss makes different shaker with different color .   if you didn't catch this review ,  it is just because this color is n/a .   they all leak .after 3 months of daily use ,  i feel bad that i have another thing to full up the landfill
i have several other kitchen aid appliances and they are all great - solid ,  hefty machines that do superior work ,  the type of items kitchen aid has built a reputation on .   so that is why i bought this coffee maker  ( actually i have the previous model before this  " update "  )  .   boy ,  howdy !   was i blind-sighted !   the quality of the housing is no better than a mr .  coffee for 1/4 the price ,  and i too ,  have experienced the leaking problems like other reviewers have noted .   and on mine ,  the spring that keeps the shut off unit down while you take the pot off the machine to have that first cup while it is still brewing - well ,  it decided to not do it's job only after about a month of owning it .   the unit leaks coffee as if that is what it was designed to do .   hey ,  kitchen aid engineers - do you read these amazon reviews ?   if you do ,  then go back to the drawing board and make a coffee maker that is in line with your other products !   and give those of us that bought your previous junk a full credit trade in to upgrade to it once it is available !   how hard is it to make a good coffee maker ?   my grandma's early 70's mr .  coffee is still perking strong - what an embarassment to kitchen aid .   nuff' said
we registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first and second box we picked up .  it's a very attractive set ;  too bad it can't actually contain food due to broken corners ,  can't be washed in a dishwasher ,  can't be used on the stove ,  and can't be used to broil !  you can't use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee ,  which is why i wanted them .  additionally ,  target doesn't allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise .  i realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too ,  but i just thought i'd point out that the corningware doesn't have to be shipped to you to arrive broken
this item is priced wrong it is not in line with the other calphalon item
i bought this coffee maker to match my kitchenaid blender and coffee gridner .  the coffee maker is attractive but works terribly .  if you make more than 1 or 2 cups it overflows hot coffee onto the counter top .  there is almost always grounds in the coffee too .  when i called kitchenaid customer service they said they made a revision to fix the problems and sent me another one .  it has the same problems .  this is not user error i have tried different coffees ,  grinds ,  and positioning the carafe differently .  this coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake .  finally i got kitchenaid to buy the coffee maker back and got a cuisinart one .  it works perfectly ,  costs less ,  and has more features .  i would recommend cuisinart and highly recommend that you do not buy this shoddy coffee maker - you will regret it .
this grinder grinds well but failed after just 2 months of operation .   don't buy it unless you want to waste your money
when i bought this item i attempted to test it in hot water .  my only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which wasn't accurate .   it appeared to register better than the grocery store model .   however ,  when using it to make chocolate fudge ,  by the time it registered 225 degree's ,  the fudge was thickening in the pan ,  not a pretty sight .   i used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction .   it has a 5 year limited warranty for replacement .   i don't feel it's worth the trouble to send back as i don't want another of this brands products ,  ever .   it's going in the garbage as i attempt to find an accurate ,  well calibrated candy thermometer
this pan is nicely made ,  and is fairly thick silicone - but when full ,  it is floppy and doesn't hold its shape on the sides .   the cake i made turned out with bulges on the sides that i had to trim off to make it a nice ,  neat rectangle .   i understand now why some more expensive silicone pans have wire  " sleds "  to support the pans
if i could give this thing a negative number ,  i would .  i just threw away 2 large bags of brown sugar because ,  after i had thrown away the bags the sugar came in ,  i could not get the z845 to work .  what a mess !  i had brown sugar all over that part of my kitchen .on a couple of occasions the sealer has worked without creating a vacuum .  this time it appeared to be trying unsuccessfully to pull all the air out of the bag ,  but the bag never sealed .i have watched the video several times and have read and re-read the instructions .  at first i thought i was not operating it correctly ,  but now i believe the foodsaver is the problem .  the first time i used it ,  to seal a quantity of chicken for the freezer ,  it worked beautifully .  it hasn't worked right since then .another problem is that it wastes an amazing amount of plastic material .  is it possible this thing was invented for the purpose of selling refills ,  rather than to work as a sealer
to whom it may concern .   cheap assembly ,  binds up on internal hardwear ,  does not press fully ,  all in all ,  very poor product .   you would be better off hand squeezing with you hand than you would with this item .  .  . run
the sheets arrived soft and after washing stayed colorfast but shrunk .   they were difficult to get on the mattress
i have had the knife for a month ,  and now it is simply not sharp .   the knife does not hold it's edge ,  and i have used it only on soft vegetables a few times .acceptable at $19 ,  but hardly high quality
i just bought this fan and it is too loud !  even on its lowest setting ,  the noise is a bit much .  it does put out a stiff breeze ,  but i'm not sure it's worth it .  my black and decker tower fan is better
i just bought this toaster  ( not on amazon )  to replace a black&decker toaster oven that had served well for more than 10 years .   this new toaster oven burst into flames when making toast filling my house with rank smoke and nearly setting my kitchen cabinets ablaze .   this is a very dangerous appliance that ,  based on my experience and other reviews here ,  should probably be taken off the market and recalled
i have to agree with the other negative reviews .  this insert loosely fits the all-clad 3-quart casserole pan i bought with it  ( which i could understand if i were trying to use it with another brand )  .  it being from the same line and company one would think that someone would have tested how well it worked .  as with all all-clad products it's built very well but who cares about that if it doesn't work properly .  someone else mentioned all the perforations are in the bottom of the insert ,  it would be better if there were holes in the sides as well .  i think my artichokes would cook a little faster if tons of steam wasn't rolling out from in between the insert and pan .  it works ,  just not very well .
these knives are already showing spots of rust despite washing by hand & drying .  very disappointed in quality of finish
i wish i'd read the previous reviews !  i ordered this for $14 . 99 as a &quot ; bottom of the page special&quot ;  and it's going back .  it is not two inches thick as described ,  but 3/4&quot ;  .  what a disappointment !  and now i see that the regular price has been changed from $25 to $40 .  yikes !  don't bother .  .
nice ,  shiny ,  new ,  heavy ,  quality product .two uses later .  .  .warped and buckled tray bottom ,  shiny ,  heavy ,  poor-quality product .i am a keen cook and i don't expect to spend this much on an so-called  " quality "  item only for it to warp and buckle after two uses under normal conditions .1 star
unfortunately ,  i ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead .   this was *not* amazon's fault ,  but emile henry's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not .   in fairness to amazon ,  they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled .althought i would have preferred the oval bakers ,  i kept the rectangular ones and do like them
we've had 3 sets in just over 1-1/2 years .   return policy is great but it's a hassle .   can't oneida make silverware that doesn't rust ?   i'm going to try a different brand
there is one huge problem with these sheets -- they are not permanently pressed .   there is no way to get out the wrinkles ,  other than by ironing them .   otherwise ,  they are fine .   but who in the world wants wrinkled sheets !   you should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles -- like your average sheet .   these sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed .   i cannot believe you are actually selling these things on-line
this product does separate the fat but small bits of meat or vegetables will stop up the spout and the plastic is not heat resistant .  mine cracked the first time i used it and after the second use it had to go in the trash can
i bought these plates after i already had the rest of the matching dishes .  i already knew that i was not pleased with them but had to complete my set of dishes and will have to tolerate them as long as they last .they are really sturdy and go with everything but they get the 'knife-marks' - grey scratch marks from utensils scraping them .  i imagine that there are white dishes out there somewhere that are not subject to this flaw ,  and if there are i hope to find them ,  but these are not them
this is a great cutting board if one able to removed all the sticker glue that stays on the cutting board forever .i tried to used what ever i can .the glue just keep staying on the board and it turns black
i am really dissapointed with this bread machine !i had a panasonic 1 lb .  breadmaker which i loved--but wanted a machine with a bigger loaf capacity .  never had any problems with the smaller panasonic ,  and received the oster 5838 fo christmas and have had nothing but bad experience--how many times do you have to experiment with the thing to get a good loaf of bread--like the panasonic ,  you should be able to follow the instructiona and get a good loaf of bread !  !we also gave 2 of these for gifts --and really feel bad as they are a pain--all 3 are going back !
i bought this in october ,  2004 because i wanted something small for my kitchen .   you cannot cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker .   now ,  it shuts off mid-way and i have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it .   hopefully the  " powers that be "  will read these comments and make improvements
i own many circulon products ,  but most of which are under the circulon 2 line .  so when this 2 pack became available ,  i went ahead and purchased it .  i have only used it to cook eggs on and i must say ,  i was sorely disappointed by the results .  not only did my eggs stick ,  but i used quite a bit of oil on the 2nd batch to make sure they wouldn't stick ,  but they still stuck .  my circulon 2 skillet makes far better eggs than this non-stick version and doesn't stick !i'm not sure what i can use these skillets for now since my main intentions were for fish ,  eggs and items which have a tendency to stick to the pan .  it also left a horrible look on the eggs like the kind on eggs cooked with a teflon pan without oil even though i used quite a bit of oil .highly disappointed and will not purchase the circulon elite line again
we have owned this blender for about 3 years .  if i had to do it again i definitely would not buy this blender .  first ,  it is very loud .  the timer quit working and the band rivets around the jar are rusty .  the only things i like about it are that it is easy to clean and the jar is nice and big .  other than that don't waste your time
it is a strong knife ;  and easy to grip ;  but ,  i am upset about the rust spots on the blade ,  especially because i gave 2 people this knife as a gift !   it was very embarrassing !   i can't return it since it was a long distance gift .shame on oxo !    i gave it 2 stars because of the good grip ;  but ,  that is all it is .  .  .  . a good grip that looks like you bought it at good will
i baked two batches of madelines side by side ,  one in this pan  ( set on a baking sheet )  ,  and another in a traditional pan with non-stick coating .  i brushed both pans with canola oil before using .  as per the package instructions ,  i allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them .  the madelines in the traditional pan released easily ,  were golden and high ,  and had a pronounced design .  the other batch were almost soggy  ( probably from cooling in the pan )  ,  flat ,  pale ,  and did not have the appearance of a madeline .  to make matters worse ,  they did not release easily ,  and a few of them even broke as i attempted to remove them .  i would not recommend this pan
i accidentally ruined my father's old baking stone so i bought this on for him to replace it .  everything sticks to it !  we thought maybe it just needed to be seasoned a bit before it stopped sticking .  we've had it for over a month and we use it at least four times a week and it continues to make a mess out of anything we bake on it .  that's not even the worst of it .  it puts out a disgusting smell in the oven .  just last night we used it and had to sit it in the garage and open up the entire house because we all had headaches and our eyes burned from whatever fumes it was releasing .  i definitely do not recommend this item .
works well and looks great but lifting is not fun .   if you are a weight lifter always looking for a few more reps for your wrist elbow and shoulder get this kettle .this stainless wk600 one is listed at 6 . 4 lbs ,  and the white plastic wk200 is listed at 2 . 9 lbs .   a big difference !   the stainless one weighs empty close to what the plastic one weighs full .   with a minimum fill of 1/2 liter the stainless weighs in at 7 . 4 lbs .  and the plastic at 4 . 0 lbs .i'm returning my stainless wk600 unit and ordering the wk200 plastic one .
i bought it because of the rotisserie function ,  which i use a lot .  this model has no variable temperature control on that function .  there are some things i cook at a lower temperature for a longer time to get the proper doneness .  i don't know why when they wired the machine they didn't route that function through the temperature control .
doesn't work .  not worth the postage to return .  the foil cutter works ,  though .  .  . so if you want a really expensive foil cutter with a free paper weight ,  this is for you !
started having problems with hot water spraying out and burning those who stand in front .  contacted melitta and they said they are aware of the issue and i have to  " purchase "  a pod holder adapter due to the pods are too thick .  i questioned charging people for something they manufactured and were notified was defective ,  the dummy on the phone didn't have an answer .  i do not recommend this product .  maybe a class action is due
i also tried some cotton wamsutta sheets from bed bath ,  and beyond and they pilled the first time i washed them .   i was able to return them to the store ,  but it was a waste of time .   i wouldn't recommend these sheets or any wamsutta sheets because i think they're poor quality
how durable can a pan be that arrives in pieces inside the box ?  i can't imagine breaking my old cast iron frying pan .  .  . this one had a huge chunk out of the side .  i sent it back and will look for a better quality item .  shame on mario for endorsing this thing
purchased this ,  expecting better functionality .  sure it doesn't rust ,  but my $5 wustoff pealer works much better
i got the machine yesterday and was so excited .  i got it all ready to prime by following the directions ,  and it didn't work .  after several attempts i called bunn customer service thinking that i must be doing something wrong .  when i talked to the customer service rep .  he told me that the machine wasn't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine .  i'm thinking for $200 . 00 this isn't right ,  and why hasn't the company fixed it ?  he was very nonchalant about it as if it didn't matter ;  just get a new one .  this just isn't acceptable to me .  there are many positive reviews so i'm sure if you get a working one than you'll probably be happy with it .  as for me ,  i refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company isn't even trying to remedy .  therefore ,  i'm sending it back to amazon for a full refund and buying the simple human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews
received the bowls yesterday ,  and once again very upset to find 3 of the 4 broken .   this has got to be costing a ton of money in refunds and shipping .   i will not try again for a replacement ,  i didn't do well with the sango mixing bowls either .   can't understand why these are shipped with such little packing material
i am simply amazed that anyone can be satisfied with this pan .   i bought this pan last week .   i fried bacon it on medium heat  ( as advised by salesperson )  .   bacon stuck .   fried eggs on medium heat .   eggs stuck .   ok ,  must be my fault--try low heat .   i fried bacon on low heat .   bacon stuck .   fried eggs on low heat .   eggs stuck .   pan would not come clean with hand washing and mild soap  ( as the instructions advise )  .   i promptly returned the pan and got a non-stick .   my life is much better .   do not be fooled by the pan's good looks .   think its just me ?   my wife's sister bought the same pan .   her report :  everything sticks .   my sister has the pan .   she hates it !   guess what ?   everything sticks .   how can a product be so popular and perform so aweful ?   you are hereby on notice .
every time i use the pan is twists as soon as it gets hot .  it makes it very difficult to cook on and to move in and out of the oven .   the non stick surface comes off very easily too .for the money i expected better !  !
this gadget is better than nothing as a sink strainer  (  unlike the  miserable sinktastic ,  which i find hopelessly misdesigned )  but it's still far inferior to any good stainless steel mesh strainer .   ( do a web search for  " sink mesh strainer "  .  )  this one slides around on top of the sink drain ,  letting gunk slide in around it .  yet it's impossible to pick up without using your  ( ewww )  fingernails .  and those fingernails will be picking up a rusting metal edge ,  if yours grows old at all like mine did .well ,   " grows old "  is overly charitable to this cheaply finished thing .  i think i used mine for maybe the equivalent of 30 full kitchen hours before the paint along the edges began to chip and the underlying metal began to severely corrode .one way this might be made reasonably useful is if you sealed it in place with a waterproof nontoxic silicone caulk so it didn't move around .  then you could scrub it right there in the sink and never deal with prying it out for cleaning etc .yechhh .  .  .
i hardly ever write reviews but i felt the need to on this item .  i bought the senseo deluxe last night ,  i wanted the deluxe model so that i could also make tea .  the setup was quick and easy and the price was great compared to the competition .  here's the problem ,  i brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee ever and i'm not even a big coffee drinker .  to make matters worse each pod only makes 4oz of coffee .  who drinks only 4 ounces of anything .  you would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak .  which is wear the waste of money comes in .  the senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast .  i personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning .  i originally bought the senseo because i didnt want to spend tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get .  now the tassimo is great .  i've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son .  everyone likes it .  good luck everyone .
the size is nice for 2 people .   cleaning is easy .   seems to be a defect in that the unit has to sit just right on the base or it will not go on and off by itself .   you have to juggle it to be sure it is seated just right to get it to come back on after the oil is heated up and then you have to be real careful that it stays seated just right .
why would anyone rate these glasses more than 1 star if amazon is refusing to credit for those broken in shipment
i encounter too much resistance when trying to pull towel out for tearing .  there is so much resitance that the base moves ,  unless i perform the procedure with both hands .
i wish i had .  this one goes to the goodwill .  grill plates are fixed and a chore to clean .  grill leaves uncooked areas if height is irregular ,  like a chicken breast .  hamburgers work best .  watch out for burns
as of today august 19 ,  i have not received anything on this plan .no paperwork , no backorder .  .  .  . nothing  !  !  !i think maybe it's just a rip-off
i hope i never have to use it ,  but i have peace of mind ,  knowing it is in place
like the other reviewers ,  i followed the instructions for this machine to the letter .   i froze the canister in my deep-freeze for several days and took it out just in time to load it .   although the recipe provided was quite tasty ,  even after 60 minutes the stuff never even got cold enough to reach the slush stage ,  let alone ice cream .   my kids pretty much drank it from the bowl .   it's advertised to make ice cream in 20 minutes ;  no way .   returned it the next day  ( and paid for shipping )
the spoon handle is crooked and there are marks/damage to the wood .  avoid
this sushi set is really nice .  unfortunately amazon doesn't know how to ship ceramic properly .in my original order ,  they sent it in a medium-sized box ,  with air cushions only on one side .  of course several of the pieces were shattered .  so i requested a replacement via the returns website .the second order was dispatched immediately and sent via next-day .  that was impressive .  what was not impressive was that this time it was sent in an even *smaller* box ,  packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst .  naturally this set was also shattered .fortunately ,  i hadn't yet returned the first order ,  so i was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first set to complete the second .  i'm sure their returns department won't like hearing that ,  but as i see it i've saved them the cost of a refund .needless to say i won't be ordering ceramic flatware from amazon again .once again ,  i like the style of the set itself ,  and think it's a great deal for the price .  i just recommend that you buy it somewhere else .
warped badly upon receipt .  too much of a pain to return it .   it is already in the tras
the product is labeled as a seed grinder ,  so you would expect it to be able to grind seeds ,  but it failed miserably .  i tried grinding flax seeds  ( about the size of sesame seeds )  but about half of the flax seeds made it through the grinder intact .  i even tried running the  " ground "  seeds through a second and third time but still wound up with a large portion of whole or almost intact seeds .  that was with the grinder on the fine setting .  it seems to be a combination of poor design and cheap parts .  the  " grinding "  wheels are made of plastic which is not the best material for friction and the design allows a lot of the seeds to drop off the wheel into the chute without having actually been  " ground "  by the wheels .  if you're wanting to grind a very small amount of seeds ,  try a manual grinder .  if you're wanting to grind a medium to large amount of seeds ,  spend more money and get a proper flour mill
look carefully at where the spout is mounted .  if you fill above this line ,  with the lid on tight ,  when it boils ,  boiling water shoots out of the spout .  and the lid fits so tight it is hard to remove without burning .i'm suprised to see this still being sold
i've used these type of units all the time until i got my own .   it stopped sealing ,  and i haven't had a chance to use up the bags that came with it !   when i called ,  they said it was probably the heat tape that went bad and they can't fix it .   they offered to sell me a new one though !   i have no idea where my receipt is  ( my fault )  .   i have to have another one ,  so i'm going to buy the cheapest one so i don't feel so bad when i have to replace it in 6 months to a year
i received this grinder because i had purchased a defective melitta grind & brew coffee maker through amazon .   the coffee maker had electrical problems and i sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed .   to make a very long story short---melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker .   they stopped making them .   amazon had my money and i waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker .   amazon would not help me and after many ,  many phone calls melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the brew and grind .   grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months .  warning--don't buy melitta products and returns for defective merchandise should be returned to amazon .
i was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and i needed to send it back for a refund
i bought a machine similar to this one late last year - it broke after about 30 cups .   the 'tap' for the steam jammed .   i'm still waiting for the repaired machine to be returned after 3 months - yes months ,  not weeks .   according to delonghi service it will be another month before it's repaired .   i have no faith this will happen ,  nor that it will work for any length of time after i receive it .   their service people ,  while reasonably pleasant ,  don't help - they know virtually nothing and seem reluctant to go beyond just answering your questions .   if you're smart ,  you'll go buy a coffee machine from someone else
recommended :no .   the product is not very durablegood things :all in all ,  this caddy is great because it's versatile .  it's huge and tall enough so a 12 . 5 "  round cake that's about 5 inches high can fit in easily .  the locking mechanism is also pretty neat .  there's 3 of them so it makes it very easy to carry without any fuss of the cake dropping on the floor .  the handle of the carrier also gives a comfortable grip .   carrier is also see through so you'll notice if the decorations have been messed up during the transporting process .not so good things :not very durable .  locking mechanism that holds the base of the carrier may crack making it non portable .this product is susceptible to breakage perhaps because certain stores just have had these items on their shelf for a long time-- that's only my assumption .  plastic should not crack unless it's placed in extreme temperatures or is abused .  should the temperature in the fridge crack a plastic ?  very unlikely don't you think ?the price is also far cry compared to other products sold by discount stores  ( i . e linens .  . /wlmrt .  other carriers are sold from $4-$9 .the height is good but it can be problematic when storing it in the fridge ,  but aren't all cakes difficult to store regardless ?in terms of cleaning the base ,  you'll need a brush to really get the bottom cleaned up
great while it worked ,  though a little large .  but ,  it broke after 4 . 5 month
awkward handles and lightweight feel .   bought as a gift and had to be returned .  chicago cutlery has better lines .
when i first bought this pan i was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from costco .   that pan lasted about 3 years and i got my money's worth .the positive review from america's test kitchen is what pointed me in this direction .   the farberware pan was a joy to use when i first bought it and i loved the even heat .   all of the positive comments are accurate at first .the problem is it only lasted 3 months before it lost it's nonstick properties almost completely .   i never used spray on oil or subjected it to high heat .   i was always very meticilous about the way i cleaned it and never touched the surface with anything but plastic .   i even bought a special soft plastic cleaning brush so as to be very delicate with the surface .i have been using nonstick skillets since they first came out many years ago .   with the exception of one ultra cheapo model i have never had a nonstick that had its nonstick go bad so quickly .   of course i can send this back to farberware but it seems clear that if it has lost it's nonstick properties they only have to say it was my fault .   why waste $10 in shipping costs ?   this is my last farberware product .after writing this first part of the review i thought it would only be fair to email farberware to let them respond .   after doing some googling i have found that there is no email .   it is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone .   they sold their warranty service to a different company ,  all american lighting in berwick ,  pa .   as it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service .   if this isn't really farberware what exactly is their incentive to provide good service ?   you can check on consumeraffairs dot com and other places and you'll get an eyeful .   buyer beware
i ,  too ,  am so disappointed with this product .  when our delonghi toaster oven died after 15 years ,  my husband and i went shopping for a new one .  numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that delonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be ,  so we decided to try the kitchenaid oven .  it appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with .  the oven ,  which was bought from a major retailer ,  looked fine ,  but the timer and bell were out of synch .  even worse ,  while the top coils heated up nicely ,  the bottom ones heated very unevenly .  kitchenaid customer service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense .  less than a week later the new oven arrived .  it looked perfect .  but again ,  it didn't work .  this time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up .  after preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual ,  we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom .  now we'll have to return this oven as well ,  and we've pretty much given up on getting a kitchenaid one at all
this brews great coffee ;  unfortunately i have gone through 2 of these in 3 years .  not heavy use either .  on my first one it started to leak the water from the bottom ,  and now my second one doesn't grind anymore .  still makes a good hot cup of coffee thou
the very first cut i made on this cutting board left a huge gouge in the surface .   subsequent cuts also left deep marks .   for something that's advertised as being harder than maple ,  i found this to be very surprising .   maybe it's the way it's put together ?   all i know is that this cutting board is on pace to be the shortest lived ever in my kitchen .   pretty much the only thing that i like about it is that bamboo is a renewable resource .   good thing because at the current rate ,  i anticipate needing a new one very soon
i loved this coffeemaker ,  until it just suddenly stopped working and it isn't even 1 year old !  !   previous coffeemakers i owned have lasted years and years .    i expect more from a coffeemaker that cost over $ [  .  .  .  ] + .   now i have to find the warranty card and go through all that hassle .   i am not a happy customer
bought this grinder after my capresso grinder developed a crack in the plastic housing .   after using for about two weeks ,  i have to agree with other reviews that mention  " static problem "  .  the grinds cling to grinder and coffee end up all over the counter when trying to pour into coffee machine .   the plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off .i would not recommend this grinder
i have bought flannel sheets from amazon before but they were from martex and they were greate .  but ,  these are just bad .  they are too thin to start with ,  left lint all over the bed and even after washing they have left fuzzies all over the sheets ,  i cannot even explain how bad it is .  i  should have waited for another martex deal
i have had this iron for awhile now .   the big problem is that gunk builds up on the soleplate that is almost impossible to get off .  except when you iron white shirts ,  when it seems to rub off of the collar and seams ,  permanently staining and thus ruining your shirts .   avoid this iron at all costs
this is a very nice small oven ,  but as a toaster it really drives me up the wall .  as someone else said ,  three knobs to adjust just to make toast !  then you have to stand there and watch it and the toast still burns !i will keep this to use as an oven ,  but tomorrow i am going out and buy a nice small toaster .and guess what it will not be an oster product .  this is the  last of their products i shall ever purchase .joh
sorry to disagree with other reviewers ,  but my experience of the paring knife was that it's perhaps the softest metal i've ever seen used in a knife ,  and as a result ,  it's not very sharp and doesn't improve if you try sharpening it .  my friend ,  a fellow cook who got it as a gift ,  doesn't like it ;  i hated it and would never choose to use it .  there's a reason the price is so low
the first time i used this yogurt starter and it did not thicken i thought that it was my technique .   after reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter ,  i tried another batch using the rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter .   the results were the same :   no thickening ,  just liquid .others seem to have had good results so it is possible that the culture i received was not properly stored at some point before i received it or that it was just a bum lot
i found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill :1 .  )  once you get a successful potatoe to cut through ,  the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids .   getting them out is a real pain ,  you need a lot of careful tugging and wiggling to remove them without breaking them .   just a mess .2 .  )  if you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe ,  you are in a very dangerous zone .   think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction .3 .  )  maybe my set was off tolerance ,  but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself .   i had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously .   not a big deal ,  but that for me sealed the 1-star rating .i guess the bottom line is ,  if you expect nothing out of it ,  you might use it ,  or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes .   for me ,  i've decided to get one of those vollcraft units .   it's on order
the decription says it is a 9x5 loaf loaf dish .   i was thrilled .  i have been looking all over to find one that size in glass .   i was so mad and disappointed when i opened the box and it was 8 . 5 x 4 . 5 .   that wasn't what i ordered .   and yes when baking bread there is a difference .   i am still waiting on my postage-paid return label so i can ship this back .  this would have been a great deal ,  except i already have the 8 . 5 x 4 . 5 pans .   they need to change the dimensions in the description .   buyer beware !
the diadem cooking set roughly meets the wmf criteria ,  though there are slight imperfections on the metal and the top .  the products are made im china .  at first i thought something was wrong ,  then i looked at the wmf site and indeed they have a factury in china ,  so they must be genuine ,  however ,  i think amazon should clearly state if they are made in china or germany ,  i ordered another wmf kettle last week ,  made in germany and i think there is a differenc
we have only been using the sheets for 2 months and it is already pilling  ( balling up )  very badly .   it is already affecting my husbands sleep so we are on a search for another sheet set .   when you see 500 thread count ,  you expect more from the sheet but i guess we should have know what to expect given the low price .   i suppose you get what you pay for .   take my advice and don't throw away this $$
i'm not sure who decided to put the word non-stick in the title of this griddle .  it took me two days to scrape off the egg omelet that i tried to cook on it the first time .  they should change the title of this item to calphalon one stick 10-inch international griddle .  do not buy unless you enjoy hand cleaning and scraping pots and pans
fyi ,  those of you with square burners will not like this one .  it is not stable because of the design ,  which is clearly meant for round burners .
i can't believe this is a rowenta product !  if you decide to disregard the reviews ,  here are some things from the owners manual  ( which i read before using the iron - and followed to the letter )  to give you an idea how temperamental/high-maintenance this item is :*do not use distilled water .  you can use tap water - if it's not too hard  ( less than 12 grains - who actually knows this ?  )  .  softened water can also cause problems .  basically ,  if you use anything except bottled water ,  expect problems !*empty the water from the iron after every use .  failure to do so will result in leaking or spitting*other than the rowenta soleplate cleaning kits  ( which run about $12 )  ,  the only instructions/recommendations for cleaning the soleplate are what not to  use .i had a very inexpensive panasonic iron for years - given panasonic is not really  " known "  for this type of item ,  my expectations were not high .  it lasted 7 years with no problems and was low and/or no maintenance .  don't count on the rowenta name to equate to higher quality on this one
very annoying that you can't get the filters for this coffee maker anywhere
terrible ergonomics !   it was so difficult and uncomfortable to keep the trigger engaged and carve at the same time .   my hand was aching by the time i'd carved the brisket .   i've never used a more awkward or uncomfortable appliance
fiesta scarlet is a beautiful color and the sugar and creamer with tray is really great .   mine arrived broken and i had difficulty returning it so i remain disappointed and unwilling to try again .
when i received this coffee maker ,  it worked long enough for me to run water through it to clean it out ,  then then heating element stopped working .   it took numerous calls to braun ,  then of course i had to pack it up and ship it off .   several weeks later it was returned to me and once again ,  it worked one time .   again ,  it took several phone calls and i had to pack it up and send it off again .   i received a new unit that does indeed heat up ,  but has several other problems .   the drip shut-off mechanism stopped working after a couple weeks ,  the permanent filter allows grounds to get into the coffee ,  and if one uses a paper filter ,  it tends to overflow the filter basket .   this is the worst coffee maker i've ever owned
i have had this product for about 2 years .   when we first got it ,  it worked great--lasted about 10 min .  at a time .   now ,  we're lucky to get the floor cleaned up under the table before it starts to wear down .   also ,  the clip which holds it to the base just broke ,  and i see that i am not the first person to experience this problem .   i don't see anywhere to buy a replacement base ,  at this time ,  so i may end up just throwing the whole thing away
the international eversharp line is henckels low-end ,  stamped stainless line .   it is not carbon steel .  it is not hand-forged .   it does not compare to the other henckels lines which are .   you get what you pay for .   these are cheap knives .this is the first time i have seen a set of henckels knives which could go in the dishwasher .  .  .  . but ,  that's because on this line ,  you do not get henckels lifetime warranty  ( which is voided by dishwasher use )
this is our second george f grill .   the first one burned out after about 5 years .   we liked but could not get the same size so we got this one .   it was bigger than we wanted but we had no other choices .   what a mistake !  !  !  !   after less than one year and not heavy use the connector to the thermostat  ( spade conn .  )  just fell apart .   being the handy man that i am ,  i fixed it .   today  ( 9/6/2005 )  it burned out again .   this grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled .   it is a piece of junk .   we will replace it with a different brand .   thanks for nothing george
this product will not work with home vacuum sealers that use a textured bag .  this is a thin plastic sheet on a roll .   you have to cut ,  fold and seal the sides of the plastic sheet .
that's right .   i got taken twice .   i bought this cooker for under $20 a few years ago ,  and it died after the second use .   considering it was so inexpensive ,  i just bought another one .   it died again after only one use .   i wish i would have read the reviews beforehand because it seems to be a common problem .   i guess salton just recycle their returns so they can afford to pay george foreman the $90 million they owe him for endorsements
this grinder worked well for about two months before the internal spring that holds the nutmeg in place became loose .  now there is so little pressure against the nutmeg ,  that the blade can no longer do any grinding .  in addition ,  the size and shape of the entire mill are awkward for my small hands .i regret not having read the other reviews before buying this .
just purchased this blender & am returning it immediately .  it has a number of terrible  features :  it's very difficult to remove the cover if you have carpal tunnel ,  arthritis ,  or weak hands .  to change speeds you turn a dial  ( as opposed to the buttons on most others )  ,  which makes for rough transitions .  moreover ,  the dial feels very flimsy and i doubt this machine will last .  i purchased this model because i thought its premium price would mean a premium product ,  but from the plastic gears to the flimsy dial ,  to the impossible-to-open cover ,  i hate it .  will go back to either an oster or waring ,  both of which served me well ,  each for over 10 years .
i ended up returning this because every time i tried it with brown rice it burned the rice .  i even tried doubling the recommended water amt .  for brown rice and it still burned .
i bought this thermomter after watching goods eats with alton brown ,  because when i make buttercream frosting i wanted to be able to clip on the thermometer to the pot and get an accurate reading .  well this themometer did a lousy job at staying clipped onto the pot ,  it kept falling off no matter how i put it on .  i even tried using other pots ,  but no luck .  i am so mad that i paid so much money for this crappy gadget ,  it sucks
first the plastic top broke off at 6 months .   then it stopped working at 9 .i have one word :  junk
i have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex .   until now .   last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400f oven ,  my pyrex dish exploded .   it rained glass all over the inside of my oven .   it was a disaster .   i am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time .   this sounds like a real problem !
i bought this pan because it was non-stick ,  plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel .   i bake my usual brownies and cookies and they all stuck to the pan .   it stuck more than my glass pyrex casserole pans .   it was not easy to get it off ,  i had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle .   definitely not non-stick .   the air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning ,  which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie ,  which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together .on the up side ,  this pan doesn't warp if you are baking at 350 degrees of below .i am returning this item ,  i wanted non-stick and this definitel was not .
did not fit the pot i needed it for .   too much money for shipping on small item to justify sending back .
please do your self a favor and do not buy this item .   as a toaster oven it burns the bottoms of everything you heat in it .   as a toaster to toast bread or bagels ,  well it still has yet to toast anything for us .   you can run the toaster 6 times and it will never toast/brown .   i was shocked that this item would be so bad being that hamilton beach is a good brand .something is obviously wrong with the production of this product .   forget about purchasing this one .   if there was a zero for the star option on this product i would have given it a zero
first of all i'm a dyson fanatic .  .  .  . i have a total of three  ( one on each floor )  .   when we bought our cabin i couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one  ( they are pricey )  for carpet i'm on five or six times a year so i bought this .   at first i was thrilled .   it was wonderful .   after using it a few times however it has completely lost suction .   keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids ,  pets or real dirt .   i would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me .   i have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked .   also the  " dirt container "  is sometimes hard to remove and put back .   feels like it's catching on something .   what a waste of money .   even in my college days i've never had a worse vacuum .   i highly recommend the dyson instead or even the $50 dirt devil i gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing .   to me  " hoover "  spells  " disappoinment "
contrary to the description above ,  this is not a non-stick pan .   i tried making eggs and pancakes on the pan .   everything stuck to the bottom .   i used bacon grease on the pan before i made the eggs .   they stuck .   i used butter on the pan before i made the pancakes .   they stuck .i could not get the pancakes off the bottom of the pan without destroying them .this might be a good pan for searing and the cleanup that comes with it ,  but it is definitely not a pan to make breakfast or any other meal that requires a non-stick pan .my 12-year-old t-fal with a worn surface outperformed this pan making pancakes .   i am definitely returning it
these silicone pot holders are indeed brightly colored ,  easy to wash in the dishwasher ,  and protective even when wet .   they are also clumsily stiff at the same time as they are slippery ,  the net result being a miserable failure in the kitchen .   they are useful for protecting a counter from a hot pot ,  but not for picking the hot pot up
contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece . some of them aren't even good . some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful " un indien dans la ville " ( presented as " little indian , big city , " and remade into that crap tim allen flick , " jungle2jungle " ) , and this . what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick . " french twist " ( the " cool " american title , not the real one , which was " gazon maudit , " literally meaning " twisted ground , " or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them . loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married . always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out . and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off . so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo . but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat . so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both . she'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she'll rest by herself . after all , she needs it if she's gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel . the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there's the little ironic ( ! ! ! ) ending . i know it's a completely different culture , and i'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad . none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in " fargo " ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience . what's shocking is this was not only one of france's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) . the writing and directing is really the big problem with it . josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all . even woody allen's not-very-good " a midsummer night's sex comedy " is intelligent , well-written , and possesses some depth . this is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch . the film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn-near painful to watch . thank god for the fast forward button . the acting , however , isn't bad at all . the actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) . and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband . but " french twist " is just pretty lame . it's not overly horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments . but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film . 
vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene . then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that . the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end . and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery . this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it . what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires . there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore . anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans . this has not always been carpenter's style . his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question . jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows . in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is . now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust . meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico . if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is . the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin . but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them . just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog . now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona . woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well . but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing . while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target . woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero . that is not his style and it just does not work very well . there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses . in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair . as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down . one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret . these vampires do not maintain a low profile . there are arguably logical flaws in the film . there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . perhaps i will read the book . 
_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . but as the trailer goes , " there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . " so he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . in fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . so for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a heart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . there are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam's impotent father's ongoing lust for them . and for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . but the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? the answer is a resounding no . it's not that macdonald isn't a funny guy . he was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural , likable screen presence . he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don't work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . still , macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . the late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . the film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . come to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . 
the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into " heartbreakers . " ray liotta's character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office . while scrambling to collect himself , he frantically shouted to her , " just wait a sex ? er , i mean sec ! " i was struck by a wave of revulsion , thinking , " geez , didn't lines like that die when 'three's company' was canceled ? " over the next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind " heartbreakers " predated " three's company . " suddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s . all across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv . while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special . women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts . on another channel , dean martin made wisecracks about " booze and broads " and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers . the adults laughed and laughed . " heartbreakers " reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated . in addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft . i can't imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project . perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s . if so , they were sadly mistaken . the story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team . it opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator . having withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night . the next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary . just as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them . the " horrified " bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way . of course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up . the women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes . in desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam . their mark this time is william b . tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking . max starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune . complications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart . as if that wasn't enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind . the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior " a fish called wanda . " i won't bother to compare the two . suffice to say that everything done right in " wanda " is done wrong here . " heartbreakers " is soulless , inept and , at 123 minutes , at least a half-hour too long . sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts , but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters . gene hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note , one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking , coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex . poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland . ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich ? , but only a bit . the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince , while doing half-assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue . bear in mind , though , that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points . if you remember bob hope specials with fondness , this might be your cup of tea . as for me , i'm going to watch " a fish called wanda " now and try to forget i ever saw " heartbreakers . " 
john boorman's " zardoz " is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain " zardoz " ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful " exorcist ii : the heretic " ) . boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece " deliverance " ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama " hope and glory " ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic " excalibur " ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure " the emerald forest " ( 1985 ) . his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion . unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . " zardoz " is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's . his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even " the wizard of oz , " a book which figures into the movie's plot . but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . it's more middle ages than space age . the world of " zardoz " is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . like " the wizard of oz , " he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources . from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , " the gun is good . the penis is evil . " that line alone is worth the movie's cult following . one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . once there , the immortals label him a " brutal " and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . i say " hilarious " because that is exactly what " zardoz " is . it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of " deliverance , " which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( " 2001 " ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in " zardoz " besides the inadvertent humor . sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . he got exactly that in " zardoz , " and it's a wonder it didn't end his career . i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . 
new address . same old attitude . don't forget to recommend a film , read the journal , or send me some of that nasty hate mail . ) starring bruce willis , billy bob thornton , liv tyler , ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j . j . abrams directed by michael bay it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film . they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like . ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . ) they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact . bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet . why an oil driller ? they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? ) harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . nor will you care . i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . " rockhound " , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? rather , why write him into the film ? -give his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack . director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . ) whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! " i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . it has a vivid soundmix . but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . bollocks ! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . remember a little film called jaws ? in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called . a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse . and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life . 
nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- " frankenweenie , " " beetlejuice , " " batman , " " edward scissorhands , " " ed wood , " " mars attacks ! " -- yet none of them have been horror films . " sleepy hollow " is his first attempt to actually scare people . i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this . i left disappointed . andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story " the legend of sleepy hollow . " in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors . ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders . several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning . he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret . along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . my reaction : ho-hum . the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting . that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series . a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman . . . well , he's a guy without a head . . . on a horse ( boo ! ) . the performances are also awful . although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent . ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character . the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish . the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken . i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only " bram stoker's dracula " and " mary shelley's frankenstein . " coppola is an executive producer for " sleepy hollow , " and the script reflects his interest in early forms of " moving pictures , " particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy . 
if you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for " wild wild west , " the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck's frappacino or on a ben & jerry's sundae . these treats are great relief from the summer heat . in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment . i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat . this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat . in this film , they are no where to be found . what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula . two men are asked to stop this threat . one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents . among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest . the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating . although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act . for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with . " now touch my breast , " west says . gordon does so and then softly coos his approval . i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness . the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter . i did enjoy kline's reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith . could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he's not even required to act ? it was as if the director was yelling " will smith , do your own thing . . . and action ! " here's an example . in this scene , will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people . he must endear himself to the crowd to escape . the director yells , " will smith , do your own thing . . . and action ! " in another scene , he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades . " will smith , do your own thing . . . and action ! " worse still , the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess . there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look . there's actually a lot of imagination at work in this film . there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced , but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat . and that's too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his 'thing , ' this film might have been palatable . as it turns out , " wild wild west " is the wild , wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year . 
the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , " i think we need a bigger bat cave , " or something to that note . that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much . cut batgirl out . cut one of the villains . it's too much to handle in one dosage . it's so much that characters get left behind . poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form . and elle deserves better . this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher . it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) . the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) . this one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck . it's up to joel to make it fun though . " batman forever " was fun . this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters . i mean , this one bit . i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days . he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body . batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart . meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had . she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people . she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo . meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl . meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing . end of her for all we know . mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) . the trio must team together " as family " to beat them . there ya go . not the whole story but no big context clues . too much , right ? right ! the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it . maybe some stunts . for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . george is in between them . he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good . but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . wow . but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . it's like she's almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points . she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . " alicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film . she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird . and it isn't the mushy-mouth this time . but in all fairness , she has virtually no part . joel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although i know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . and poor elle . poor , poor elle . i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) . but she has no part ! ! ! it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there's a couch scene . in the original , it was with vicki . in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena . and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . this one , it's nothing . and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly " part of the family . " fortunately , we get a lot of alfred . he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life . he's a god . he's a father figure . he's also dying . this got to me . i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered . but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do . and there are some nice touches . when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume . i laughed . and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . " i laughed at all these . the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or did it just feel like that ? the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . people are fed up with stupid films . that's why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! " that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld's " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck . he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great . but his costuming for woody allen's " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . i love the " batman " series . the first two rocked and i did like the last one . but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman . and michael keaton . but we can only hope . 
unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . there's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point . dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . once the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop . penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop . what one tough cop lacks is originality . this film offers nothing new . nothing that you can't get from any cop film . it screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . too much else is lacking . i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice . but once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . at times , i was hoping to see it . one tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique . it is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . but one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . 
has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ? nineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong . police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school's hastily formed soccer team . his partner-in-crime is the new british " exchange teacher " ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat . like soccer . most of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers . kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them . other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy . instead of a peppy pop score , which would arguably work to better effect , most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else . comedy needs music . just watch any old bugs bunny short . the marx brothers knew it . mel brooks knows it . unfortunately , the current trend is to " overscore . " lush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment . remember the simple strains of bizet's " habanera " in the original bad news bears ? these days , it's usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path . much like adding frosting to already frosted cake . an awfully big adventure ======================== the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral . their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w . w . ii liverpool . hugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months . bleak make-up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into . an awful adventure is not without * some * rewards , tho . the peter pan subtext is intriguing . as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth , alan rickman , and prunella scales . basil ! devil in a blue dress ===================== the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn't nearly as gripping . writer/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley's crime novel . denzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he's burdened with a miscast supporting cast . tom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine . the problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot's femme fatale . she's a pretty face and nothing more . also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney . they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles . john huston , we miss you ! fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus . they help to overcome a pace that's too polite for mosley's jazzy , swingin' story . steal big , steal little ======================= i can't say much about this one . director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes . they're fighting over their adoptive mother's estate , a 40 , 000-acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers . so many different plots are trying to come together--feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director's ambition . too bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out of sync . that is , with the exception of alan arkin . he's the best thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited writers-- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao . and what the heck does that title mean ? 
midway through " anaconda " , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co-worker and says " i thought this movie would be my first big break . instead , it's turned into a disaster . " truer words have never been spoken . " anaconda " is a monster movie with a lousy monster . it's a suspense film that is utterly predictable . it's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack-in-the-box . as you turn the crank , you're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens . the main difference between the giant snake in " anaconda " and the clown in a jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic . " anaconda " boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years . animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you've endured at disney world . but it's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame . in one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air . the scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper . here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon . what's really amazing is that the filmmaker's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie . but enough about the phony snakes . now it's time to talk about the lousy story . heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest . stoltz tells his crew " pray that you didn't forget your bug spray . " apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no ill effect . along the way , the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama . within minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness . from that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from " jaws " and " dead calm . " one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz . early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious . so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ? also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ? ah , the mysteries of hollywood . the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen . jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters . lopez , who starred in " selena , " is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible . ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously . there's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he's gently mocking his own tough-guy posturing . but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight . obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of " jonny quest . " at one point , he looms over the crew and says " the anaconda is the perfect killing machine . it strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love . and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode . " that moment is so high-camp that it almost made the film tolerable . almost . fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out " anaconda . " don't . there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer , including another " alien " sequel . wait for them , rent " jaws " in the meantime , and don't throw away your money and time on drivel like this . 
i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest . not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a " superhero " been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . mr . freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum . i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be . after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons . my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . not bad , but wouldn't the police ( or maybe batman ? ) notice if the road was on fire ? i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . . . . it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . as if three protagonists and two villains weren't enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . all this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn't . in fact , it's kind of boring . mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson's joker and danny devito's penguin . their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , " today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! " ) as it is lame-brained ( didn't it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . and robin's constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . strip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a " batman movie , " and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick . 
old soldiers never die , they just turn into cliches soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body . jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both . often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes . without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams . warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy . they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle . this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies . america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers . todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype . chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine . his childhood is cruelty and competition . he is indoctrinated with the big rules . never question authority . winning is everything . strength beats knowledge . a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete . a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger . left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world . obviously our hero is still alive . he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health . when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world . they are the other good guys . these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons . todd finds himself in the role of protector . what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon . the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion . the plot is old hat . we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers . hardly anything makes sense . the film's science fares badly . with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid . after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away . even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines . virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 . there is nothing in the story that is not predictable . the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him . it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer . is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ? who would you guess wins ? some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy . todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse . later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion . supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous . dastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash . responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic " the fifth element " , director paul anderson sees the film as " shane " in outer space . maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode . the movie doesn't even work as an action film . there is never a question as to the outcome . somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for todd . the acting isn't anything to write home about . nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim . russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge . uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space . gary busey as todd's commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role . everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool . sometimes the sets are impressive . unfortunately " occasionally " and " sometimes " don't make a film . most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote " blade runner " , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made . sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film . peoples says that this is not a " blade runner " sequel , but a " sidequel " that takes place in the same universe . although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the " blade runner " replicants watch to pass time . perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining .

it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . both those films were tense exercises in chills . the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . the thrills all came from the plot . ronin is like a film made by another man . somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . if you miss the opening , do not worry . this film will explain again what a ronin is . sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . the story is not very easy to follow . it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . some very good actors are involved in this film . one wonders what they saw in the script . the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . this is the first blow of the 47 ronin . 
wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles . this is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) . that this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the main quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse . this is done without her knowledge . it is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . it is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist . of course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for . the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone . alan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet . this sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story . anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . and , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place . 
in " gia " , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . sadly , though , my fears were realized . it's just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn't particularly enjoy the world of fashion . she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . no because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me . quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . the first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . these early scenes were interesting . we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before . the movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model . >from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . it all seemed so excessive . fine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? couldn't the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . quite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . as i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . what do they do that warrants a movie ? strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . gia did not . and by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . not exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i'm concerned . 
all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . still , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference . no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep . what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate . at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer . but there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . on screen , it's still paper thin . 
some movies i should just skip . my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon . but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? turns out i was right , mostly . inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where " formula " isn't just business , it's a way of life . the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . in some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany ! i want more zany here -- and -- here . " " let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . i want the audience squirming in their seats . " " ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . " " what does this scene do ? character depth ? but where's the zaniness ? i don't see zany here . if you can't make it zany , cut it ! " the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor . oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town . or , maybe all career politicians are like that . i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . the dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad . the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget . penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . let me rage here just for a minute . michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . the " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen . all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . but if true , why ? if they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . 
what a contrast ! in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . i'm not sure you could get two more different movies . while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . this is one interesting movie . it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . his big question is : does it all pertain to him ? and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? " it " means everything : television , friends , events that happen . i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ? this is not a movie for answers . donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . that's what makes this movie stay on your mind . these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . the performances are all superb in hurlyburly . i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him . chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world . unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . first , it's depressing that such a world exists . a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men's world . where are the stories about women's world ? not the soap operas and the " chick flicks " that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . it's very talkative , intelligent and static . while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . it also means that you have to pay attention . 
watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . so why such a seemingly high rating ? there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . the sound and screen kicked ass . nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . i even liked the computer-generated settings . i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . william hurt isn't too bad either . neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a " real " kiss -- no sex ) . it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . that type of moviemaking is a lost art . now for the bad news . worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . " you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line . and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : " he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' " then there's the tone of the movie . the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . then it could be an adventure movie . they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off . still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who's the center of a family . many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . in star wars , the rebels were the good guys . we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . finally , a few specific details deserve criticism . the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . why ? why bother saying what year this is . just tell us it's the future . i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics . one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it . still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards . 
well there goes another one . sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good . this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite . from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . it's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . 'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . besides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . being one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers . 
susan granger's review of " mulholland drive " ( universal focus ) whatever david lynch is selling , i'm not buying . from the writer/director of " blue velvet " and " twin peaks " comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a '30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip . the next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase . her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet . the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust . meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city . the tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered . elena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch . the same cannot be said for former m . g . m . dancer ann miller who's stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " mulholland drive " is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out . 
when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure . it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the " unseen " terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie . the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie . but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it . but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . there really isn't much of a story here . just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . and the special effects are great . in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the " cool shots " quota . at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . but not scary . then we have the set . when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . what part did these rooms play in the story ? absolutely none . they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . then we have the actors . lili taylor has never been one of my favorites . and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . i have no idea why liam neeson took this role . he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . all catherine has to do in this movie is look good . fortunately that is something she does very well . while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project . the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . if the story sucks , it's all downhill from there . my advice ? if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . if it's scares you want , rent halloween . either way , it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting . 
first impressions : critically , a close-to-awful film , but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great . a sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring . an orginal plot that grows old real fast . one of the only 90 minute films that i've gotten bored through . men in black has defied the odds . when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas . however , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie . tommy lee jones and will smith play two " government " agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society . the ridiculous plot begins when an alien " bug " , played weirdly by vincent d'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that's somewhere on " orion's belt . " anyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth . the premise is ridulous , but that is not why i didn't like this film . i love original plots . this one had an original one . but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films . whenever i saw d'onofrio's bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got terribly boring after a while . while smith's wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn't enough . and also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can't have contact with any humans really . and here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ? a sentimental moment in an alien movie ? nice try , but i don't think so . it doesn't work here . it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don't only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones's conscience . i came into the movie not wanting to see jones's conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it . maybe it's unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were . nevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick . 
call it a road trip for the walking wounded . stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . that's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . they haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . ( only in the movies , right ? ) too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree . kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . ain't they a pair ? unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . this revelation exists purely for its own sake . aberdeen doesn't know where else to go . weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . headey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . it's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders . it's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . despite skarsg ? rd's solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . there's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama . aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin's hollywood mogul pronounces , " all of life's riddles are answered in the movies ! " even foreign films are taking that advice to heart . 
hav plenty , as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film , is a true story . life itself is a series of true stories , but most are not movie material . as scripted , directed , and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot , hav plenty limps along at best . its dialog is so stilted - " you know what they say , 'no women ; no cry . ' " - that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it . in the story , lee plenty ( cherot ) is a 28-year-old author and teaching assistant . the movie , which happens mainly over the new year's holiday , consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed . since he consistently refuses , caroline gooden ( tammi katherine jones ) figures that he must be gay . eventually he and havilland " hav " savage ( chenoa maxwell ) get together , proving that he wasn't gay after all , just picky . sexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them , but he will not even kiss them . he's a man who knows his mind , which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute monologues . filled with wealthy african-americans , the story is closest in tone to love jones , which was better . hav plenty's story doesn't go anywhere . at the end it subjects us to lee plenty's new film , which is a movie of the movie we've just seen , but with even worse acting . " remember folks that , as outrageous as this all seems , this is a true story . " hav tells the camera , but the problem is that it's not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting . hav plenty isn't so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience's time . hav plenty runs 1 : 32 . it is rated r for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers . 
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers . occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called " teenagers . " can't hardly wait , however , does not . instead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to . can't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation . the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) . i couldn't stand any of those characters . whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming " yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! " , all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film . apparently , can't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not funny . in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour . and when i say " forced " , i mean it . they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange . this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour . for instance , can't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as " i am a sex machine . " for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny . if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny . 
mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . jackie chan plays , who else , jackie . this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . not that it ever makes a difference in the plot . there are only two scenes of him cooking . for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , shades of broadcast news ? ? ? anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . the action is a mixed bag here . there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . but to slo-mo jackie running ? either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . however , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . 
i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . the movie cuts again , this time to the present . the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the " blair witch hunt , " which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . how did i know ? because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained . the party of five heads off into the woods as promised . they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events . there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , " right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! " ooh . spooky . the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . wacky hijinks ensue . tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about " reverse , " and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , nevermind . ) this movie was awful . simply awful . the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . erica is the nature-loving wiccan . tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . steven is the overbearing asshole . kim is the antisocial goth girl . old , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? because she's pregnant ! how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? because she wears a lot of eye makeup ! how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of " deliverance " ! this is weak storytelling at its worst . rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . it didn't work . on top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . ( " honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . let's get on a plane home . " " no . i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on . " " ok . " ) frankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film . the first movie worked by never showing us the horror . the witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . the horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . knives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . this movie didn't stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . by the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . it is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no " monster , " that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . i found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director's intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . and if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? the snowfall of manuscript paper ? hm ? ) blair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . from the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through . 
i looked at the " internet movie database " 's awards section for this film , and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for " best picture ( drama ) . " anyone who's seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the " great " disaster films , and that's not really saying a lot for this film . " earthquake " is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured . on video , it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster . while this worked in , say , " the towering inferno , " it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters . the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including " skyjacked " and that classic , " soylent green " ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his " shaft " thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) . in smaller subplots , there's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a . ( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who's playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ? guess again . he gets interested in the final frames ) ; there's genieveve bujold's moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy , there's walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . . . - the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who's big moment is a dance he does at a critical time . as for the actual " earthquake , " it's rather a let-down . there's a full hour of character-setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) . this film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored . there's little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it . there's an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured . but none of these are all-too suspenseful . the finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which brings out a big let-down . and there's no real finale . even " volcano " ended nicely , and that movie really sucked . not only is it hokey , but you don't care about any character . who cares if heston dies ? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ? who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid " stunt ? " who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ? and who cares about that whole plane spiel ? if anything , " earthquake " is worth a viewing for the same reason " glen or glenda ? " is . i mean , i laughed at this more than i did at " bio dome . " but that's another story ( and review ) . in short , " earthquake " gives disaster pics a bad name . 
i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . now , before i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . catherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . if you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . the problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . the result is that the entire production feels contrived . i'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . now while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between " entrapment " and " blackmail " . with an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . well , you'd be wrong . the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . one last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself " it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? " we know jon , it's called editing . 
" flubber " is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney . it's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless . what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film . hypothetically , i mean . " flubber , " as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , " the absent minded professor , " where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as " flubber , " you know , flying rubber ? the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several " show-stopping " moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . in fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in " the abyss . " philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . through a plot twist , hoenicker's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he's evil enough . a sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara , who's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . and in another subplot , philip's day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . yuckity-yuck . what's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . you don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . earlier in '97 , they released " jungle 2 jungle , " an adaptation of a really awful french film , " un indien dans la ville , " which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . disney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called " magic . " such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . i sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? didn't think so . it doesn't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . philip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . those times , he's not bad . but what are we supposed to think of a man who's forgotten his wedding thrice ? maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . . i like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for " hercules , " which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they've been pathetic . " jungle 2 jungle " is probably the worst film i saw last year . " flubber " 's probably second . what do they need to do ? perhaps create something new . get writers who can write something that's universally entertaining . films like " the parent trap " and " mary poppins " are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they're not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults . what's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? and my god , couldn't they have done something else with edie mcclurg ? 
filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . doug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . in his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . consistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . neither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles . in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success . although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . go doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it . as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night . 
spoiled rich kid kelley morse ( chris klein ) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present . he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town , where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because he's rich and they're not . he ends up provoking jasper ( josh hartnett ) into a race and as a result , the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it . kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner , and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family's barn . jasper's girlfriend sam ( leelee sobieski ) soon takes a liking to kelley however , despite the fact that 1 ) it was her family's diner that was destroyed and b ) all kelley does is sit around , sulk , and smart off to the townspeople . but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless , that's apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper ( whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair ) . so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley , especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech ( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people ) . in the speech , kelley quotes a poem by robert frost , which just so happens to be sam's favorite poem as well . awwwww . soon they're frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town ( especially jasper's best friend ) see them together . kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town , especially when he shows up at the town dance , drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper . kelley runs off and decides to leave town . sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him . jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her , and sam , without even breaking stride basically says " see ya ! " and takes off to boston with kelley . here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around , its completely worthless . chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers , and it's because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place . however , not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both . i shouldn't have such feelings towards people i like , but their characters are so infuriating that . . . well trust me , you'll feel the same way . even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong , kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two , simply because his jerkish actions are calculated . he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it . jasper on the other hand , only reacts to kelley's provocations , and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions . but , as in life , nice guys finish last . for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film's only sympathetic character gets completely crushed . then , a cancer subplot comes into play ( where things get even more infuriating , if you can imagine that ) . what , things weren't depressing enough for you mr . screenwriter ? who greenlit this project ? who " on earth " thought this would entertain anyone ? perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people . but even after he's destroyed these people's lives he continues to be a snob to them , and ruins one more for good measure . here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment . it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions . extras include jessica simpson's music video for " where you are " , a commercial for the film's soundtrack ( which by the way is the only good thing about the film ) , the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots , trailers for other fox releases ( anna and the king , anywhere but here , the beach , drive me crazy , ever after , romeo + juliet , simply irresistible ) , as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy . the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine . . . nothing that will challenge anyone's audio/video systems of course . fans of this movie ( if any exist ) should enjoy the dvd release . here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling . no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film . it is merely a waste of time , money and talent . 
i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on . i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley's on-edge , extreme acting was a riot . so naturally , when the trailer for " almost heroes " hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down . a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big breakthrough . i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley's best , in spite of david spade's absence . i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran . sadly , none of this came to pass . the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between . perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with . and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it's a farley flick . the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second . perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley . and farley's classic humor is widespread , too . almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot . guys , let's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ? stick to " tommy boy " , and we'll all be " friends " . 
writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that " virus " comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron's early works . in fact , " virus " is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the " aliens " vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . in fact , " virus " should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like " virus " is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated " deep rising , " but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called " leviathan , " an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part " alien , " part john carpenter's twisted remake of " the thing . " " virus , " again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . they get on . they break up into pairs and investigate . and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even " aliens " played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn . i almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . like anthony hopkins for " legends of the fall " ( the line " scrooooooo 'em " has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . or peter o'toole in " caligula . " great actor , horrific performance . it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . " virus " mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , " if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . " and if you don't believe me , go back and rent " godzilla , " and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . but all of this doesn't matter since " virus " is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) . imagine the first attack of the aliens in " aliens , " shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of " virus " : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . and my god , it's a long damn sit . with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made . we already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like " out of sight " and " saving private ryan " give you more faith in them , but movies like " virus " manage to drain a little more out of the pool . i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . in fact , shouts of " egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? " are not only justifiable , but encouraged . 
this movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name . before this film , the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were ok . but the idea of doing a movie is insane . it should have been animated , if it should have been done at all . instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast . yet it still fails . the plot is completely different from the game's plot- i'm not complaining about that . the story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company . eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un-safe . so , due to luigi's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate . they get transported to a blade runner-esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper ) . somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city jumbles in . the plot is fine- better than the movie deserves . the acting is ok . this seems to be more of a visual film . the special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi . however the film drags and is no fun . and it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably won't ever be made . this movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth . so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros . : the movie . you could do worse . but you could definitely do better . . . . street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van-damme this movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 . it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot . it is more like a " movie " than it should be . yes , it's watchable . raul julia does a good job , considering this was his final film . while the game had non-stop fighting sequences , this movie is a hodge-podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time . does it work ? sort of . . . the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m . bison ( raul julia ) . guile ( jean claude van-damme ) takes his troops to attack bison's main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over . in a short amount of time , the movie introduces several characters well . it catches your attention . but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like " there's chun li ! ! " or " look at that fire-ball ryu did at vega " . it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets , but goes no further . this movie needed more action in the first place . the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting . if you like light-hearted action flicks , or if you liked the game , watch this one . it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia's last performance , or if you can't get enough of van damme . other than that , you could find better action flicks . . 
here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is . all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie . in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . she is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species . this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie . simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . it has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins . he still can't act . we all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) . this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par . 
i'm giving this stinker . normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg . i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all . maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . in mine , it's not . or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking . because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one . at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing . brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it . wrong mel ! i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere . this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad . he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out . but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr . ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ) lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave . hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass . it's just too funny . racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ? oh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk . i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head . but i digress . anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word . golly , will the hilarity just never end ? he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west . together , they save the day from evil . not one person in this movie gives a decent performance . wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie . ok , he really didn't -- but he should have . the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day . i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience . i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions . actually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie . i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . 
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . cage should have known what he was getting himself into . he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . in fact , the marketing people are counting on it . no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . there's a word for people like you , nicolas . that word is called recidivist . . . repeat offender . 
it's time to take cover . after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that . we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . harry survived , but his wife did not . a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak . they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . this film contains a number of cliches . the amorous couple is one . as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die . the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm . this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , " cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got . " even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked . " is that your recipe for frog soup ? " asks one of the team members . " it's my recipe for disaster , " responds harry . dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , " acid eats metal . " thanks for the tip . when we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such . this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , " u . s . geological survey . " i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs . although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , " why do they want to kiss ? were they even attracted to each other ? " if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . who does he think he is ? james bond ? the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . there are several " warning signs " prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything . for example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . a tremor occurs . does he plunge headlong to his death ? is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? no , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . it wasn't . one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante's peak . in a disaster movie , there's usually one guy who's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . it's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . if you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . in dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough . maybe the mayor's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . for no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . there are a couple of good things about this movie . the first is the scenery . there are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . the second is the special effects . they are the closest i've ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . but when elements which don't speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you'd probably better rewrite the script . 
the premise of this movie is , well , pretty far-fetched . tom berenger plays shale , a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) . fortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher . not telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher . the students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice-pick wielders . . . you get the picture ) don't really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers . this gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : " see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south . " oh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before . but wait ! there are drugs being dealt in the school itself ! and behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not " cod " , but " knights of destruction " . . . really ! ) , is none other than . . . the upright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson ! so shale does what any good teacher would do . he gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school . ok , so the premise is not just far-fetched , it's downright dumb . if this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun . oh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ? and to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story . but over all , this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language . in fact , it reminded me of " miami vice " without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels . if you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it . otherwise , wait for video . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . 
late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an " artificial conversation " with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed . at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how " cute " it can be . the happy couple " psychoanalyze " each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . why ? well , because they have to . otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . you know , the average porn star . the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . she is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . what happened here ? the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . the direction is film-school-grad obvious . it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of " cops , " characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that . if he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so lucky . 
hey , i've got a great idea for a movie ! ok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! what's that ? sounds too boring ? ok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are " i'm in pain ! " looks ! what's that ? that still doesn't sound funny to you ? how about if we through in some " ewwwww ! " looks ? still not funny ? if you answered " no , that doesn't sound funny " , then ( ding ding ding ! ) you're absolutely correct ! for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's " seinfeld " ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion . what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell . what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs . . . namely , talent ! backing up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce . just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it's final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton's names . the irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton's and not lachman , there is nothing much to do . . . except run away and join an amish community . first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn . alley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) . allen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple ! this entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning ! the amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing . it's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! bryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either . in fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first " power rangers " movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! now that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it . it bumped seven films up a notch on my " worst of " 1997 movie list . that's right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year's worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn't have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list . if you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all ! 
synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur . unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . stalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . the narrator states that " this is the story of daryl gleason " and tells the audience that he is the stalker . of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . if the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . stalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . stalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . he overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . maryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the " stalked " of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . brooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? of course not . she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . when daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . stalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . if you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . 
a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche . a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche . a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche . a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche . at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche . complaining about cliches = cliche . ok , ok . so we always hear about cliches . but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn't a cut and paste example of everything we've ever seen . they might as well use this as a training film : " how to make a bank robbery film in the 90's " . karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison . she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn't even know she's alive . aware of mccoy's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six-year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past . he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt . and if she refuses ? who knows what he'll do to the kid . ( cue sinister laughter ) this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it's hard to know where to begin . the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant . i can't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot " twist " , etc . , is so damn generic that you'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera . basinger is absolutely vacant . and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ? here's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we're supposed to feel sorry for her . as she confronts her son , who doesn't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ? especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional-radiance whatsoever . i suppose i should mention val kilmer . yeah , that's right - he's in it ! quite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name . and he got second billing ! to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j . t . barker . unfortunately the script doesn't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) , we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project . the real mccoy just can't keep it's head above water , and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie . the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra . this is definitely one to avoid , folks . the real mccoy is anything but ! 
in the year 2029 , captain leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , " boogie nights " ) is training 'his' chimp pericles to pilot a pod from the usaf oberon space station . when an electromagnetic storm is encountered and pericles' pod is lost , davidson sets out unauthorized and lands thousands of years in the future on the " planet of the apes . " maybe if 20th century fox had set the proverbial 100 chimps in front of typewriters they would have gotten a better results than this adaptation of the pierre boulle novel by william broyles jr . ( " cast away " ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( " mighty joe young " ) . director tim burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake . davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins . however , he's rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , " duets " ) . ari ( helena bonham carter , " fight club " ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , " titanic " ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion . she takes a liking to leo , who she deems 'unusual . ' general thade ( tim roth , " lucky numbers " ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race . he's sweet on ari . it's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes . the much ballyhooed 'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down . an attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , " driven " ) giving each other 'back off' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them . the lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton's squeeze , lisa marie ) . guffaws will also likely greet charlton heston's cameo as thade's father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying . the only real success of the 2001 " planet of the apes " is rick baker's makeup , and even that's an iffy affair . no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work . roth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade's right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . giamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . tim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even's he's undone by some obvious wire work . bonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . most of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . the ape's city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . the apes' military costumes ( colleen atwood , " sleepy hollow " ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka's work on coppola's " dracula . " that oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman's tribal , percussive score . " planet of the apes " was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that's going to the dogs . 
synopsis : when a meteorite crashlands in the arizona desert , community college professors ira kane ( duchovny ) and harry block ( jones ) are first on the scene . they discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the rock and is evolving at an amazing rate . soon the army , advised by dr allison reed ( moore ) , moves in and forces kane and block out . but when the aliens begin to menace society , it may take the scientists' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity . review : " evolution " certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy . it's directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his " ghostbusters " success into a twenty-first-century counterpart . it stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his " x-files " character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition . and then there's moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress . a shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass . " evolution " is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script . it has its moments ( a scene in which jones' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour . moore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast . duchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with . and the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys . part of what made " ghostbusters " so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for . " evolution " is so mind-numbingly tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens . 
in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama , " glory , " but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994's " legends of the fall , " and 1996's " courage under fire . " those two films weren't bad , just not very good , but with zwick's latest film , " the siege , " he has finally made one . " the siege , " is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city . investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it . later , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more . they soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist . there are some movies that simply don't need to be made , and , " the siege " may very well be one of them . oh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a " meaningful " action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , " die hard , " which also starred bruce willis . this time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax . whatever points , " the siege , " earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place . the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , " john caprenter's vampires , " by placing them all in the category of " bad guys . " " the siege , " contains three fine actors---washington , bening , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development . bening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again , he has no real character . by the climax of , " the siege , " with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called " message " of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , " on deadly ground , " in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment . " the siege " is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay . 
when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment . even politicians ( ! ) tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising " filth " like pulp fiction . these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be . thusly patch adams isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation . similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess . the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world . 12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we're all living in a frank capra movie . meanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the " movement " which has apparently begun to grow . pay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core . it's as if director mimi leder didn't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't " gutsy " enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for . so the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being " saved " , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather . pay it forward offers " crowd pleasing " elements for general audiences ; jay mohr's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking " black hoodlum with a heart of gold " ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? . hurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a " nigga " and says things like " can you feel me ? " leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . ( maybe spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all ) . these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . it's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . one scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i'm not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it's all very theatrical , especially hunt's performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't get academy awards . the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts : " boy this outta floor em " . naturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . but oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . they're so adorable . of course the blame can't all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . the first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth's possible demise by a crazed meteorite . the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . deep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it's a movie that treats earth's impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : " see my movie isn't as na ? ve as you might think " she seems to be saying . no , it's just horribly confused . 
often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . many elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don't convert into a solid work . although a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . the community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . over time , the people have taken to themselves . the town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . so what happens when a " tourist " ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town's police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance's involvement with this musician . the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . it features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . technically , this film is a nightmare . the music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . the lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . in addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one's patience . the film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . there was , however , potential for this film . it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people . these are all topics that could easily fill a movie . perhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . most importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren't such a bore . until then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out " mommy " while he wanders astray in a park .

reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy , " analyze this , " i asked myself , " how could this miss ? " robert de niro ( " taxi driver , " " raging bull " ) , billy crystal ( " city slickers " ) , lisa kudrow ( " the opposite of sex " ) , and director harold ramis ( " national lampoon's vacation " ) . these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of " analyze this " was very funny . unfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times . the film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen . middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel's ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well . although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) . in little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won't even admit to having anxiety attacks . ben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death . it seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben's potentially happy life gets into danger . " analyze this " has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time . admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline . since " analyze this " bills not one , not two , but three writers , you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot . one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop . coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films , " clockwatchers " and " the opposite of sex , " lisa kudrow's throwaway " girlfriend " role is an incredible step down . sure , kudrow's fellow " friend " jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in " office space , " but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston . kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place . chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character . finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on " saturday night live " ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal's patients and then completely disappears . too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal . once " analyze this " approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow's laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben . afterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches . " analyze this " proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material isn't up to their level , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air . 
the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) . year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . i thought stripes would be different . with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition " dear god ! " every few seconds . stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either . most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m . p . onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the " aunt jemima treatment , " which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . you don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . " i'm not enjoying this , " the woman protests . my sentiments exactly . 
this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed . but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . they sacked him after he got sick . now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation . that actually is the whole storyline . speed 2 could do without dialogues . the movie is all about images and remarkable sound . i don't really know why this is called an action movie . except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies . first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie . then desaster strikes . sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around . i looked for the " action " but couldn't find it . most of the time she is part of the decoration . the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door . now we know that she can handle a chain saw . we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds . the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed . jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water . his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger . he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part . then there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster . he doesn't succeed , though . an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential . before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror . i can't really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny . especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat . there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie . in keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death . a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision . some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie . had they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them . those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects . in an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate . but the ilm special effects can't save the movie . for all the money they could have done better . 
rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . running time : 117 minutes directed by : christian duguay i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career . he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled " blade " . he has had his typical action movies , " boiling point " , " passenger 57 " , but his new movie " the art of war " should just be called " rising sun 2 : the art of war " cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . anne archer plays his " boss " type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's " blade " . i walked into " the art of war " expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . the only real 'good' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock " the matrix " , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . christian duguay's direction is also not that great . his camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . even the whole " matrix " ending wasn't even good . the stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . his placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . anne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . she is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . even donald sutherland as a co-star can't save this movie from being a bust . so for an overall opinion : " the art of war " is a total waste of time . it's not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . it is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . if you really want to see a good version of " the art of war " , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind " rising sun " , it isn't a great film either , but at least it's better than this . 
jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998's lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma . it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal . would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ? let's find out . plot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead . that's when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother's death and to exact some of his own style of revenge . critique : three words : not enough action ! simple enough ? not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments . and a romance angle ? why , one must ask . . . why ? i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie . and i thought this was supposed to be his big break ? how 'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ? what a letdown . even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film . in fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the " hits " for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called " screenplay " . i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time . the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn't matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines . but no , save lindo and aaliyah , who weren't too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly . and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he's the overlord of a drug ring ? ! what a mess . then again , i don't want it to seem like i'm complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story . well , i guess that's what disappointed me the most out of this film . there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving . also , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt . it should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity ! the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch couldn't save the rest of this film's uninteresting plot movements . i'm disappointed for jet li that this film didn't give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes . hopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor . for now , i just hope that for his sake , the film's title isn't a premonition of the movie's ultimate fate at the box-office . 
1989's " major league " was a delightful surprise . i didn't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny . however , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale . that's certainly true of " major league ii " and the most recent entry , " major league : back to the minors . " the title is , of course , a contradiction . shouldn't it be " minor league ? " that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie . original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger ( who returned for " major league ii " ) are not around , leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie . the other veterans who return ( dennis haysbert as voodoo-inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who was introduced in " league ii " ) seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise . the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle , inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf . the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell ( scott bakula ) , who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manage the twins' aaa team , the buzz . you can write the movie from here : he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win . there's a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing ( walton goggins ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barry ) , twin outfielders both named juan ( the difilippo triplets ) , and a couple pitchers with throwing problems ( judson mills and peter mackenzie ) . along the way , gus picks up cerrano and tanaka ( gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs , even though he wasn't in either of the preceding films ) . sum total : none . the entire enterprise is artificial , and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors . gus' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ( ted mcginley ) . leonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves . ( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) . gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins . ( wanna guess who wins ? ) " back to the minors " is a movie that has no reason to exist . there's hardly a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel . 
best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . if you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . big john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . l . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . highway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) l . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . the restraint is admirable . but l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . it's too much . there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . this plot thread predictably leads to violence . not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . it's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . in this regard , l . i . e . ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . how often does real life work this way ? to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ?

it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us . ( at least in the movies anyway . ) it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor . charlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family . apparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling . so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge . this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again . one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood . fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort . while they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film . with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes . one bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend . it's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film . ragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original . roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie . i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video . never a good thing for a horror film . another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare . for that matter , they were almost nonexistent . if i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . the first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list . if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes . either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation . 
8mm is not going to enlighten your day . it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well . nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe . the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . or so it seems . welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change . the devil changes you . ' these turn out to be very wise words . 8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . this is where everything goes awry . although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . cage is the film's sole flame of energy . his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry . this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side . 
based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . can you say . . . the third times not a charm ? plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign . i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . when you consider that the other " part " of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this " big " summer blockbuster . it blows . or as they say in french , " eet blows " . could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? maybe . could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ? perhaps . or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? naaaaaaah ! a bad movie is a bad movie . on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) . he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . they have two kids together , greta simone and owen . one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has " kasdan " written on it . lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas . since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films . she stands 5'2 " , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . one of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle . 
the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length . if you haven't already figured it out , i didn't like this movie very much . the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme . tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society . he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march . back in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city . ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . ) anyway , tarzan's old jungle friend appears to him in a vision . tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city . he leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa . of course , jane is hot on her ape man's heals . the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys . sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? it's actually an improvement over the real thing . the acting is just plain awful . i'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn't acting . jane march wasn't a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes . compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies . added to the sound problems was the cinematography . this film was filled with beautiful african scenery . but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me . quite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment . then we have the special effects . " special effects in a tarzan movie ? " you are no doubt asking yourself ? yes friends , the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story . probably for the sake of using cgi , since it did nothing but hurt the story . in most parts , they weren't bad , just nothing special . but , they were more than a little on the hokey side . except of course , when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie . the grand finale's special effects went right into the toilet at that point . it almost looked like they had run out of money . these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production . i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don't mix . stay far away from this version of tarzan . 
synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating . the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity . the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , tramps about in the woods . with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , leggings ) . tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , as the earthquake slowly recedes . a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . this movie is really stupid . it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . she's of the " new people " ; they're of the " old people " with " the memories . " yep . we get it . we get it . the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . this movie also suffers from its new age trappings . maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while . it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people . the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . 
it's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( " the matrix , " " existenz " ) would collide with the even more popular serial-killer genre ( " kiss the girls , " " se7en " ) . the result should have been more interesting than " the cell . " as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained . after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report . meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim . his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them . he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning . although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast . not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma . from the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction . to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking . so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time . the focus of " the cell " in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality . for the most part , it's style without substance . in his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father . all in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development . singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem's " losing my religion , " and " the cell " seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted . singer lopez seems to think she's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting . the premise had great promise . the computer-generated world within carl's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic . the first room catharine enters in carl's head shows this promise . she finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments . the panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse . this scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder . another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath . their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine's own psyche . like sidney lumet's " the offence " or michael mann's " manhunter , " " the cell " could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator . however , catharine's character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role . bottom line : don't get trapped in this one . 
alexander dumas' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . perhaps the musketeer , a new film that " reimagines " the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many . it's just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences . this time , d'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can't even pronounce his character's name . as a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu . he vowed to have vengeance . after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy . on his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government . the royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal's own guards . only a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) . together with d'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant . oh , and as an afterthought , d'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) . just thought i'd mention that . now , look : i don't know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing . i have nothing against " modernizing " classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects . director peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie . instead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing . when the musketeers finally get to holler " all for one , and one for all , " i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt . maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams's tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader's digest condensed version of the story that he gives us . it's as though anything that may have been construed as " fun " was purposely expunged from the production . the joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame . chambers can't act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren't given the chance . and when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit . some movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck . with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful . the film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time . 
ugh . that about sums this movie up . just , ugh . the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic , and when reviewing the previous films , each film had a certain degree of intelligence . and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects , horrible dubbing , and a man in a lizard suit , they maintained a certain degree of . . . how to put this ? . . . dignity ? not quite the word i'm looking for . you understand , right ? and in 50 years , godzilla has maintained that degree of 'whatever' . leave it to america to screw the whole thing up . >from the 'geniuses' that brought us " independece day " , arguably the worst sci-fi movie of all time , to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had . while they do bring us eye-popping special effects that will amaze you , they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies -- a storyline . summing up the movie is simple . heck , i can do it in one sentence : giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it . simple as that . matthew broderick stumbles over his lines , and it's hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog-walking character on the television show " mad about you " . the dialogue seems to be improvized , almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all . i can see the scene on the set right now . " all right ! we spent all of this money making big special effects , and we've gotta get this movie out by summer or it's going to bomb in our faces . so , you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head , all right ? make up something , m'kay ? good . roll film ! ! " the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing , and some of the cinemtography is well-done ( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind ) . still , an hour into it , you will become antsy , wondering how long they can drag it out . and drag it out they do ! ! i have to laugh . the slogan for the film is , " size does matter " . i think they cut this too short . it should read , " size does matter . acting does not . " 
arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good . donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . the 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp . but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how . the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? ' a lot , and mike giggling like a loony . there's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing . also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . there are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one . the blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . i suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods . apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . although a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . it's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com ) is better than the film . 
well i guess it's that time of the year again . the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions . it's also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases . in america they call this time " summer " and it happens once every year . and maybe it's the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it , but in the process normally weak , insipid lines like " consider this a divorce , " " hasta la vista , baby , " and " you're the disease . i'm the cure " actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs . this is not entirely a bad thing , of course . what am i talking about ? i'm talking about the summer " blockbusters , " the " action thrillers , " the " this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone's-going-to-go " explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects . in the rash of " my , what big guns you have , but wait ! mine are bigger " movies , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of " save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threats " offerings . i'm talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc . this year i'm talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser . here in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of " my explosion is more real-looking than yours " movies , but nothing else . mission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us . the same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called " mission : unavoidable " ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation . that's saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the '60s/'70s . in eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger . he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re-situating them with new identities . his new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he's ever relocated , is " an actual , real life honest person . " because she's so good , and has such nice legs , arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her , and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from * his * killers . lee obtains evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated , black-market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair . of course , as the formula goes , her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck , there are people in high places who will go down with this , because yes , this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world ( that is , america ) since watergate . in protecting lee , arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil robert deguerin , nicely played by james caan , and ends up having to prove that he isn't the one killing the programme's witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn't accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new , green guns his enemies all have . it's around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission : impossible theme , because arnie's mission includes breaking into a high-security building to run a disk . i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about . it's an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles , and which can see through walls . it has some sort of x-ray vision , so its user can target the victim's heart even from great distances . despite this , which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun ( though i'm certainly no expert ) , however , arnold , whose own heart is targeted a number of times , * never * goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun . instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time , giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous : " i'll be back . " like everyone else in the theater , i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me , because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily . although there is a * lot * of violence in this movie , not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators , i recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas . review's rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . 
the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane ! , the " police squad ! " television series , top secret ! , three naked gun films , and two hot shots ! movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard . even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof . leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40 , who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis , general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ) . the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint , timing , or tact . most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags , recreated movie sequences , and soggy star cameos . yeah , maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l . a . bus bound for a speed bump , but did mr . t , hulk hogan , and dr . joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie ? leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair . there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit , even the resulting sister act spoof is silly . as are the bits directly lifted from home alone , pulp fiction , true lies , etc . etc . ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess , tho . the butt shots , breast peeks , penis pokes , flatulence gags , and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley . ) beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song , spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on . my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start . stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave . you won't miss a thing . 
it's tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city . just ask mr . furious ( ben stiller ) , the blue raja ( hank azaria ) , and the shoveler ( william h . macy ) . they're trying to break into the biz , but captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) , the city's hero numero uno , hogs all the action . the good captain has his own problems . because he's all but eliminated crime , amazing's endorsement deals are falling through . the public craves a major slugfest , so amazing engineers the parole of his one-time arch enemy casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) . frankenstein succeeds beyond expectations ; he captures capt . amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city . so , no one is left to save the day but our would-be superheroes , but their abilities are more " little league " than " justice league . " the raja hurls forks at foes , the shoveler hits them with a shovel , and mr . furious just yells at people ( stiller is doing essentially the same character he played in a guest appearance on " friends " ) . after a painful first strike , the guys hold auditions for teammates and add the bowler ( janeane garofalo ) , who carries her dead father's skull in her bowling ball ; invisible boy ( kel mitchell ) , who can only use his powers when no one is looking at him ; the spleen ( paul reubens ) , who blows devastating winds from his rear ; and the sphinx ( wes studi ) , a mysterious figure who will teach them to fight . " mystery men " boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled . in addition to those already mentioned , the credits include lena olin as frankenstein's evil shrink , comedian eddie izzard and the fugees' prakazrel michel as disco-themed thugs , singer tom waits as an inventor of superhero weapons , artie lange ( from " mad tv " ) as another thug , claire forlani ( from " meet joe black " ) as a waitress mr . furious is pursuing , louise lasser ( from " mary hartman , mary hartman " ) as the blue raja's mother , and actor/magician ricky jay as capt . amazing's manager . the cast includes four oscar-nominated actors ! when i saw the list of players early last year , i figured the result would be a can't-miss comedy . yet , i must report disappointment . the script is probably the worst of 1999 . nearly every joke misfires . the stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny . ( for example , no one can recognize capt . amazing in his secret identity because he's wearing glasses . ) the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work . the cast tries hard , especially hank azaria , whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume , but the script is just too lame to run . 
that's exactly how long the movie felt to me . there weren't even nine laughs in nine months . it's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it's the fact that grant is annoying . not just adam sandler-annoying , we're talking jim carrey-annoying . since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has " a big pussy , " referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . why a child psychologist ? so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : kid : my dad's an asshole . grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? kid : my dad's a _huge_ asshole . more like a hugh asshole , but that's beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant's equally annoying friend's wife is also pregnant . the annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed " arnie the dinosaur " ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . his is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? that's my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line " now it's time to take a look at your volvo , " another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . nine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . hugh grant's sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won't leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant's nervous smiles . everything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . over 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . but at least they didn't spend 60 bucks for it . 
some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch . then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains . the real mccoy is both . it's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation . the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job . six years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight . she soon bumps into j . t . barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen . j . t . also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him . schmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery . this time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son . just when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in . * contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them . leading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins . there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in . karen's initial encounter with j . t . during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility . it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment . small world , eh ? then there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage . however , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day . but the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne . there is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character . karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material . schmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture . only kilmer's j . t . is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed . in fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot . i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast . various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room floor . even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes . there is no tension in the scene , just tedium . russell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room . there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones . like karen disarming one of schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing . like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later . tempted . but i'm pretty good at resisting temptation . 
mr . bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting . the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride . heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick . either way look out america bean is coming . well , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot . that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy . it achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help . the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed . the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went . don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece . but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid . the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems . now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner . well , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure . i have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done . although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is . i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . now the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting . i think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie . a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved . one thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results . tv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek . bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless . but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie . but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie . there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one . 
the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware . this movie can't make up its mind . is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? either way , " unbalanced " is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort . the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years " getting over " the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses . now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it . with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald's . but when his " discovery " becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it . with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the " shelmikedmu " tribe ( named from the first half of each child's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe . despite the professor's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf's main assistant . hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books . krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe . on the opposing end is krippendorf's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe . it's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf's tribe could've been a real winner . sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a " family comedy " ) just aren't the right tone for this film . cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you've got a good start . at the state it's in now , you've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs . doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try . the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of " average " , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them . most of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated . director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways . it's stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) . it's this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it's a brutal drop . a strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she's holding his penis ? yes , it's put that bluntly ! just be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame . 
robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil " sheriff of rottingham " . a good adventure plot that is sadly unused . elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable . perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from " rent-a-wreck " ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . if you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film . 
the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . last year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . whatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . unfortunately , things aren't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . it's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . there's not much that's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . for die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . and , whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in the first movie , it's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as " the killer . " they're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . and so , in the end , it's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . god help us . 
the cartoon is way better . that's the bottom line on disney's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature . the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic " home alone " with puppies , and not much else . when production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be " why ? the original cartoon still works , so what's the point ? " the answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign . the story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple . two dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight . they drag their " human pets " together , and in a short time both couples marry . the heavenly match-ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy's new-born pups are stolen ; their dog-napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts . everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies . in the original movie , the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities . we also could hear them talk , which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film , the dog's view of humans as their pets . in the new version , the dogs are mute and expressionless . hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks . while he drew the desired " aww , they're so cute " reaction from the audience , it was quickly followed by several people whispering " i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog's heads to get them licking like that ? " the canines' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little . joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles . in previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona . in " something wild " , he revealed the rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor . in " terms of endearment " , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer . here , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it's a wonder their images even stick to the film . glenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality . as the villainous icon cruella devil , she tears up the screen in a deliciously over-the-top performance . close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself . with a two-tone fright wig , red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips , garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels , close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature . she's clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon , and her wicked glee is infectious . when she spits out lines like " you've won the battle , but i'm about to win the wardrobe ! , " the film comes briefly to life . " 101 dalmatians " is crammed with john hughes' typical heavy-handed approach to comedy . after an ingenuous opening showing pongo's morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park . a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on . the second half of the film , where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen , is a tedious home alone clone , with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon , including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence . " 101 dalmatians " has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close , but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick , bland characters , and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high-fiving one another . rent the cartoon ! 
capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain . his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse . a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns . , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . ben kingsley ? " my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . the second punch comes from gal's past . back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . " however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin . kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming . when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . any local hood could have done what gal is needed for . additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . it is not a great plot . in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . it is an old plot dressed up to look new . if the plot is old , at least the style is creative . this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . we see one side of a person's faces . but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission . he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses . after they ricochet off his face , he says , " not a good start . " as it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well . in this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed " condor " , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi's during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war . for some reason , condor is given his mission at the u . s . embassy in spain . i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart . watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe . the chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned . it's almost a guarantee . anyway . . . . condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly . to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) . there aren't supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . in fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight . i suppose this isn't so bad , since chan's action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . if you've never seen a jackie chan movie , don't expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves . they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . knowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting . you've got to hand it to a guy who's probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art . also of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor . as far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes . unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan's movies are simply entertaining . you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . unfortunately , even chan's mastery can't save this film . the plot and characters are so weak that they don't hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . 
yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . neve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ? ok ! yeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises . we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce " mr . lombardo " . the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done . on the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . yes , that bill murray ! sound like a good , complete movie ? yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . unfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been . the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . and it's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap " party of five " , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . that's how cheezy it comes off . but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's . in the right hands , wild things could've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . and what's up with these people passing as high school students ? i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . i won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . as corny as it is , it's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a " b " for effort . but if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you'll be right at home with wild things . perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters . 
kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems . it appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired . she learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr . mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company . her freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her . a solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with . kate's boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick . kate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it . her first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan . the actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ? . at a dinner with kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up . she meets nick to propose the plan . he accepts . kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas . the office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn't give kate the time of day , now does . now that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam's sudden interest . things start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her . after some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate . it appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available . or maybe kate does like nick , but " reconciliation " will force her to admit her lies to her employer . adding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down . there is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra . it made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one . there is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer . it's like the director said 'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't that great so , what the heck , let's show jennifer's assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating . " quite frankly it's insulting . i don't think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie . she did a decent enough job in ed burns' " she's the one " because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn't deliver the goods effectively in this movie . her performance was not convincing . unfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies . the film is similar to " my best friends wedding " in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry . i didn't care for how quickly kate puts down nick's profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers . at least " my best friends wedding " changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending . no such luck with " picture perfect " . every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense . after everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? was quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? throw in the fact that i don't think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision . i believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? i doubt it . and what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? well , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense . picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jennifer aniston nick . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jay mohr sam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . kevin bacon mercer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . kevin dunn darcy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . illeana douglas rita . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . olympia dukakis written by randy turgeon , february 26 , 1998 . visit my movie reviews ! www . xtdl . com/~canran 
there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see " mission to mars . " there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind . but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " armageddon , " " apollo 13 , " " the abyss , " " close encounters of the third kind , " " e . t . the extra-terrestrial , " " alien , " and " aliens . " why ? because there is not one original idea in " mission to mars . " all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films ) . if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film . of course , there are other reasons not to like " mission to mars , " the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time . " mission to mars " manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time . the plot , cribbed greatly from " 2001 , " concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet . luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians . the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in " 2001 " -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in " 2001 " ) . a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride . after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel . now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home . after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth . " mission to mars " is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film . that's it . everything else fails . the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script . only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in " 2001 " ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does " mission to mars " come to life . a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes . take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way . the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , " 2001 " ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? why are the characters such idiots ? because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . all the " conflict " is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : " jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together " -- does anyone really talk like this ? can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? the whole film is like that . the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time . sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : " look , there's mars " astronaut b : " you sure that's mars ? " astronaut a : " yeah , that's mars all right . " astronaut c : " hey , are you guys looking at mars ? " that exchange isn't actually in " mission to mars , " but i wouldn't be surprised if it were . for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell . de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . this is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over . fourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . the principal actors sleepwalk their way through " mission to mars , " never managing to do away with an apparent " i'm just here to get a paycheck " attitude . cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . armin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard " decent guy " performance . and sinise hams it up with " wistful " facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in " 2001 " who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy " mission to mars , " but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of " mission to mars " has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . supposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of " armageddon " ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . me , i alternated between the two . there is only one good thing about the way " mission to mars " finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . 
" love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . sound confusing ? it is . i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . in some respects , it works . but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister . but so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them . well , i didn't , at least . one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza . here's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . here , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . like i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline . " love to kill " should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it's just too bad that the story doesn't really add up to much . the stars deserved better , and so did the audience . 
" pokemon 3 : the movie " has a lot of bad things in it . first of all it's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation . the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically . a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million . warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid . this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is " pokemon : the johto journeys " so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown . they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities . the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly's house and creates every wish she wants . now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one . too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between . it has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods . i'm still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon , they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth , my personal favorite ) and you don't understand what they are saying . my little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was . his response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this . . . he sure did put me in my place . with the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well . " pokemon 3 : the movie " has some redeeming qualities for the kids , and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film . for those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this . . . bring a pillow . 
plot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music . one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) . once married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce . at that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star . that boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it isn't long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants . this is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers . critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , doesn't really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through . in fact , this isn't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet . i guess that i was expecting the former going in . the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant . but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience . chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen ) . well , i personally don't care for those films , and didn't really get into the whole " show " atmosphere of this movie either . i guess i might've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just didn't care enough about the characters to delve into the " so the butterfly represents his freedom ? " side of things . all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn't make me feel any more fulfilled . what was hedwig's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ? what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ? ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) what ever happened to the lawsuit ? and more . . . all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat . if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well . i didn't get it . the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either . then again , i've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen . some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added " atmosphere " of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience . but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn't leave the theater very satisfied . i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers . i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene . note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single " mainstream " critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself . but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the " official " critics , while i , a regular " joblo " in the audience , just wouldn't get what all the fuss was about . this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews . where's joblo coming from ? moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love's labour's lost ( 8/10 ) 
as bad as " mimic " was , it definitly scared me . " mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie . director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . " that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie . in " mimic " , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original . the plot is a stupid combination of " aliens " meets " species " meets " jurassic park . " the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies . there's nothing new in " mimic " . it's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work . at the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back . maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on . i don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the " seven " trend and be set in dark , dank areas . watching " mimic " i was tempted several times to yell at the screen " turn the lights on ! the switch is to your right ! use common sense ! just do it ! you'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! " there's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off . it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts . " hmmm . . . . i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . " " mimic " has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo ! just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you . the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too . i shouldn't blame del toro . he isn't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie . hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , " the killer " and " hard boiled " then came to america to make the stupid " broken arrow . " french directors luc besson ( " la femme nikita " ) and george sluizer ( " the vanishing " ) followed woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies . robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget " el mariachi " came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget " desperado . " i don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can't make a good american movie . woo finally broke through and made " face/off " , but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films . i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , " welcome to america ! i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long . do you speak english ? now , i know you think you've made good movies in the past , but now you're in america , so things are a little different here . just remember what the american audience always wants , and you'll be fine . they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they've seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up . if you don't make that kind of movie , you'll be shining my shoes in no time .

the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division . his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid . if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter . he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : " shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? " ) . even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . 
the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright . directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth . and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble . jeez . after a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy . they hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem . that's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn't it ? the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times . i was not alone . plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents . the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots . the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact . producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon . 
instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " . i have a name for it myself : " gross " . this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ? this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence . instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's " psychotics ward " . assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . and then there's the inevitable " heartless meanie " character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor . he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . let's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . not good old theo . no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says " we need to talk about this right now . " this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems . director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . it aims to " inspire " rather than to touch hearts . as yoda would say , inspire it does not . it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story . indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character . this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . i love animals , and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable . tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . ? 1999 eugene novikov 
cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins . while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . the story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i'll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . the film is based on a " mostly " true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . it's during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . tim robbin's just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . for robbin's it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . let me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it's the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . i'll begin with those involved with the play . there's orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . outside the play there's the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who's unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . there's a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . anyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . now although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . sure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . the whole film is like this , and it's basically nothing but a headache . on the brighter side , tim robbin's direction was masterful . his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson's latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can't make a movie that much better . although it has it's moments ( not many of them , but they're there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it's title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over . 
" shagadellic ! " , " groovy , baby ! " " smashing ! " adorn the 1/4 page ad for this movie tabbed as " the #1 comedy in america " as of may 8th . did we attend the same movie ? ! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong , like a snl skit on steroids , and at any length it seemed unfunny . yes , the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills , and yes , the concept , dealing with a 60s secret agent/pop icon ( played by myers ) awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy ( dr . evil , also played by myers ) in the present day , had a great deal of potential . fun costumes and scenery and potential do not a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor . don't get me wrong , i like a good " bubbles in the bathtub joke " as much as the next person , but to have this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie is a waste of yuor talent and my money . but , the way things work these days in the movie business , all a film has to do is call itself the funniest and people will believe it . i do give this film stars because of the sets , costumes , and sadly , unmet potential . 
i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy . boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment ! after an hour of the movie , i was ready to change rooms-into another theater ! read on to see what i have to say . . . . four rooms : starring : tim roth , jennifer beals , antonio banderas , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willis , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ione skye . possible stars ) " four rooms " was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year . key word here : " supposed . " four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast . i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great . the plot : it's new years eve and it's a bellboy's first day on the job . he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems . tarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script . it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy . anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them . the second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot . this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife . the third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite . the final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone's finger . the movie was just plain trash . there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film . it was not funny , and i didn't hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film . tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy , and he ruins every joke in the film . the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors/actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals . marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role . this movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great , perhaps like a more upbeat " plaza suite , " but it wasn't . as trashy as it was , some people will call it classic . do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna's chest showing a classic film ? look for more of ken's kritic korner coming soon ! please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews . p . s . " four rooms " made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995 . 
i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing . unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . but it sure is a fascinating failure . marky . . . er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . when they do this , it turns out she is paris' . . . goddaughter ! it's very bad to have paris against you . the story is standard action film stuff . it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . the scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . characters betray each other without a second thought . grenades are thrown in tight places . people jump out of tall buildings and survive . people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . most frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . they're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . the acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . it's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . 
i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness . i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them . the plot , for those that couldn't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) . of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye . their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human . using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection . the first half of the movie succeeds on most points . cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't know feelings so can't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions . unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive . as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right . her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning . likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film . when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel . the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel . the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie . the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel's eyes . the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can't feel the world or , more importantly , he can't feel maggie : he can't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats . this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears . if he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn't her just make the leap and become human ? after all , what's so great about being an angel ? sure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what's that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ? and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it's all downhill . the philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience's hankie . it's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film . i feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level . i came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing . i could go on longer , but i don't want to " ruin " the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on . city of angels , then , is a paradox . it's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea . all these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up . 
if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then " bully " 's for you . based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , " bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( " kids " ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities . in terms of the incident and what provoked it , " bully " stirs up nothing new . the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . he hounds and harries and humiliates his " best friend " marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . simply remove him from the equation . marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . there's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . they did it because they wanted to , and because they could . what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in " bully " but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in " there's something about mary " look like the height of subtlety ! ) . clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . the conclusion of " bully " offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . " bully " aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . 
long ago , films were constructed of strong dialogue , original characters , memorable plot points , and solid acting . one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is . this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) . hitting the road with her hick , guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby , due in a month . stopping off at a nearby wal-mart for a quick rest , novalee's boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there . novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) . a wacky librarian ( keith david ) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store . then the she moves in with a family , befriends everyone in town -- including ashley judd's character ( who has five kids and still can work part-time as a nurse ) -- fights off religious freaks , survives a tornado , breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her , receives an inheritance , builds a martha stewart-esque house , becomes an award-winning photographer , and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot , all while not once doing anything with her kid . this film is terrible . the directing is awful : it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them , over and over and over again . we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman , who can do good work . a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off . a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal-mart parking lot . an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters , making the audience ill . taking two great comedic screenwriters , babaloo mandel and lowell ganz , and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah's book club . altogether , it has the feeling of being trapped at home , watching a very bad television mini-series and wishing it to end , only the remote is broken . however , the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ? no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk . 
director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film-- the dreadful comedy steal big , steal little-- was funny . keanu " i'd rather play music than play another action hero " reeves is the grad student on the run , who , along with his superfluous sidekick ( rachel weisz ) , has been framed for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks . ( the mushroom-cloud explosion is a knock-out and easily the best part of the movie . or , as one audience member succinctly summed it up : " whoa . " ) false information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run , fleeing over open drawbridges , across icy lakes , and through the corridors of power at a top-secret , underground energy facility . aiding and abetting is the team's shady mentor , played in an excellent-but-so- what performance by morgan freeman . ( brit brian cox is also about , as the behind-the-scenes bad guy . he has some fun fiddling with a southern accent . ) unfunny , overscored , and without a single shred of suspense , chain reaction is * the * summer movie to walk out on . if you make it to the end , a mess of cross-cutting involving another imminent explosion , you'll hear somebody say " i guess it's time to go . " heed that warning . 
according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time . take for example " casablanca . " great film , even today . it's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic . another example would be " star wars , " which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before . but as i rewatched " independence day " when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it . i had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good " escape film . " but when i rewatched it , i felt cheated . thus , the curse of the " event film . " " independence day " is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation ) . but after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one . well , this kid is the " event film " in my little analogy . and when i rewatched " independence day , " not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time . there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama . one scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines . the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of " glen or glenda ? " now this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls . and " independence day " has no balls . it plays it safe everywhere . it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films . the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of " star wars . " i mean , isn't that devil's den ? and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in " striptease . " they're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men . i mean , come on . the aliens in " 2001 " were more interesting and you didn't even see them ! basically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful . okay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly . now they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction . yep . these aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too . they also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later . the president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered . i don't care if it's bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there . i don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there . later on , he's stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship . i think it's time for impeachment for this guy . he's more senile than reagan on pot . then there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave ) . his girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with " striptease " in that she has to do it for her son . come on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance . i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers . she's also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l . a . ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives ) . there are some bright spots . they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing . the best one is when jeff goldblum ( nicely named david ) turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says , " good morning , dave . " and they even played r . e . m . 's " it's the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning . and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he's a stereotype , but i just loved the man anyway ) . but there are no real subtle comic moments . will gets way too many one-liners and he has no one to play off of ( execept jeff towards the end , and the two do great ) . as i said , this film has no balls . it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that's what it is . but after a couple months , we all move on to the next " event " film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure . but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime . this one's short on batteries . 
" there's nothing new under the sun " is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means " let's find something to copy . " of course there are very few completely original ideas . even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience . there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time . recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script . my understanding of the word " sequel " is a continuation of the story . the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes . have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma's adaptation of the steven king novel ? this is your dream come true . rachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her . doors slam shut by themselves . glass globes blow up . her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent . a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out . the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event . any of this sound familiar ? once the audience catches on that this is the same story as " carrie " , there's little to do but wait for the inevitable ending . the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well . there are a couple of minor plot differences . rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized . the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original . they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest . and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out . one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell . over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie . now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered . there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense . after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in . still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ? sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease . this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a " disease " is never explained . sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her . blink and you'll miss it . some of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown . it doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random . " the rage " retains some of the trappings of " carrie " without the meaning . in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie's onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating . here there's an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose . the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin . one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds . the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original . seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one . 
confucius once said , " governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don't overdo it . " his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make . granted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn't exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series " beavis and butt-head " was pure gold for its network ) . but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal . in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon " dilbert , " which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of " saturday night live " rather than a full-length feature . the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . other evidence of office space's failure to work are its lack of good jokes . the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud . the material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of " downsizing " the company's payroll . when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but . a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it's definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent . 
i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . the best way i can put it is that it's funky . i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of " police academy 4 : citizens on patrol " , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song " citizens on patrol " during the opening credits ? it's just like that . anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me . she's the lone survivor this time . part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects . jason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he's completely bald . also , it being one day later , it can't be friday the 13th now can it ? oh well . steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series .

the happy bastard's quick movie review wild wild west a better name for this movie might've been " wild wild waste " . warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer . wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is . heck , ten times . as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair . they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . but the acting doesn't help either . kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib . branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard . and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . her acting is barely passable , but what a " breath of fresh ass " . director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either . even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit . last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable . at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train . he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion ! also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible . if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will . if the performances don't bother you , the story will . if the story doesn't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will . there's no end to the vicious circle . go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . you'll have a better time . if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant . i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . . 
" houston . we have a serious problem . " after making " mission : impossible " , brian de palma has a lot to live up to . by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience . and the possibilities are certainly there , but the result is a great disaster . starting in a near future , with a prologue copied from " apollo 13 " , de palma slowly builds up his " story " . the human race has already set foot on mars . a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened . this is basically the whole plot . so it's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours . but de palma manages to do that . it is not a very good achievement . as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake . the film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is . david mamet's dialogue , while trying to seem natural , is distant and simply fake . de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot . the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick's " 2001 : a space odyssey " , " apollo 13 " and " godzilla " . to make time pass , the creators have inserted several " refreshing " scientific details , that would not convince a half-crazed frog . it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp-offs from several great science fiction films and stories . when it finally presents an almost original idea , it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity . i can't even call this film predictable , since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this . sometimes it gets so cheesy , that you'll start laughing when you're supposed to cry and cry when you're supposed to laugh . you'll see enormous sandstorms , hear mysterious sounds and , last but not least , on this " constantly surprising " tour you'll see -- an alien . it's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but " lost in space " is actually better . that's an achievement in itself ! director brian de palma has stroke gold with " untouchables " that became an instant american classic . it is for this film that he will be remembered , while all his other failures will be forgotten . he'll live to fight another day ! i send the actors my condolences , since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters . and both the cinematography , production design and art direction are very decent . it is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10 . unfortunately their hard work was in vain . if you have problems with insomnia , i recommend you this film . if you're not asleep within the first half hour , consult your doctor . 
there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start . recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much . a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e . l . e . ) that wiped out the dinosaurs . what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world . firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid . to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) . mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted . ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . ) it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . however , the film simply fails on that note . the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials . she's still making good money though . t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) . leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) . plot holes , plot holes , plot holes . now , e . l . e . is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ? where's the logic ? leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 . and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start . it's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter . building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr . strangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . now that is a more practical use for caves . what is the point of living in caves ? there is no , unlike `dr . strangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . how do plants grow ? if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open . the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . in an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres . this is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact . but even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it's still watchable , just don't think about it . okay ? 
girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . there was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . if there was a point to the film , i missed it . girl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . the plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . she begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . also , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . he is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him . her neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . he also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . the soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . it kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting . for parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . of course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music . prince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . of the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy . he was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . he should have stuck to acting in this film . there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up . there are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers . in that film , they worked to propel the narrative . in this film , they just made me more confused . there are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . other than that , though , nothing much happens . there are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . i'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past . in girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . he had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . girl 6 earns a grade of d . 
plot : set in the future , a courier has uploaded some data into a " hard drive " that resides in his head , and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information . since he overloaded his " hard drive " , he's also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him . critique : incoherent , boring , one-act drivel with no suspense , horribly unbelievable futuristic environment , bad dialogue , career-defining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending . it's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us . it's one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark " junkyard " type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever . . . ) , and all the sets look like . . . . well , sets . there is also absolutely no arc to this story . it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain , and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings . gibson should stick to writing novels and " x-files " episodes , since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage . some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped-up cyber-doctor or something , and ice-t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( don't ask ) . the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point . i'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was . some of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it's one of those bad movies that's just funny to watch and cringe at . thankfully for keanu , he redeemed his sci-fi career with 1999's the matrix ( 7 . 5/10 ) . it's too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent . little known facts about this film and its stars : as of 1999 , director robert longo never directed another full-feature film . hmmm . . . now isn't that odd ? : ) writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 , after being rejected for the draft . he lived in toronto at first , but since 1972 , has made vancouver his home . his 1984 novel " neuromancer " and its sequels 1986's " count zero " and 1988's " mona lisa overdrive " are generally considered to be the definitive works of the " cyberpunk " science-fiction sub-genre . this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the " worst actor " category in the 1996 razzie awards . 
there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test . sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion . there are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold . as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients . a terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits . and up go the lights . it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic . writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously . deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes . case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda . in deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive . he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable . in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . he looks at another character . . . and winks . make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing . it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun . i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing . just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point . 
everybody in this film's thinking of alicia . no , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the " cryin' " video . this is one of those erotic thrillers , but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed . first off , there's zero sex , almost no nudity , and it's not as well-plotted as one of those tweed flicks . well , anyway . the " plot . " alicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party . the film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters' thoughts , except alicia's . the thing is alicia's in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren't too kosher . first off , there's her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in " mallrats , " and is only a notch better here ) , who's a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from " suburbia " ( who shows he's got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) . they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky . somethine like that . the film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters' thoughts . we get to see jeremy and nicky's dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t . thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal . it even shows them in bed together . yea . i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i'm used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in " flirting with disaster . " the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . like we care about any of the characters . the only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she's alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . so i guess she's some kind of mystery or something . but she is never explored further . so , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . i mean , there's a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they're just as good as sleeping pills . and this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film . 
the ads for " batman and robin " scream " the event of the summer is here " and that's the problem . the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . " batman and robin " is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . it wasn't always this way . tim burton's " batman " was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline . those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . " batman and robin " has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness . the blame lies with director joel schumacher . a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do . " batman and robin " is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who . while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . " batman and robin " doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . ironically , the parts of " batman and robin " that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . easily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at . the film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father . as for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling . i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where " batman and robin " really suffers . as mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . once thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . thurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . the biggest lesson to be learned from " batman and robin " is that more is not better . joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . i don't think so . my prescription ? fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) . give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough . call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the " event " mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . 
let's get this one over with as quickly as possible . if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming . but as it is , " godzilla " is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio . producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch " last year at merienbad " until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs . dracula ) . " godzilla " opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word " gojira " ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . we are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . he is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . the military , with dr . tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture . the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet ) . i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe . everything about " godzilla " reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years " razzie " award . the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously . but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . no . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . the film is bleak and ugly looking . taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . everything is ugly and dark . new york has never looked so inhospitable since " death wish " . in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue . the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint . the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up . you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint . for a scientist , this is very poor observation . let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : 1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? 2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating . 3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? 4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables . 5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . 6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel . 7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot . 8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . 9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel . 10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . 11 . ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ? 12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? 13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? 14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . new yorkers hate beta cam . i could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . don't be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of " america's funniest home videos " . the performances in the film are singularly bland . not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . the characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . the only common occurrence that doesn't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . godzilla for the most part is okay . the design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . one thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . now , i for one can't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . there is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . the addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of 'jurassic park " , but with none of that film's suspense or tension . suffice to say that , " godzilla " is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade . this is a film that needed the hype . with the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds . if you've seen the trailers , you've seen the best parts . my only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes . . this film could be the next " rocky horror " . only it's not funny ! 
it seemed like the perfect concept . what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . jim carrey's signed on too ? even better . the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth . such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny . it's not for lack of trying . the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something about mary . " ( 1999's " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . ) the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment . the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go . ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? yeah , me too . ) the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross . the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either . that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities . there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions . this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . " it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither . as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film . chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine . even after that happens , though , i'll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire . 
" varsity blues " is the best film of 1999 thus far . unfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 . it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999 . it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the " big game . " by the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? will everyone in the town turn against the coach ? will the team win the climactic game ? do cats bathe themselves regularly ? the so-called " hero " in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . at least he's got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . heck , in one scene , the front page of the town's newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers' big win the night before . when the team's star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team's leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the " bad guy " ) . worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john's scholarship chances if the badgers don't win their final game . the plotting of " varsity blues " is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's " all the right moves . " one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv's " dawson's creek " ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . while i probably shouldn't blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and " by-the-numbers " screenplay by w . peter iliff isn't of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in " all the right moves . " the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . smart does not allow her character to become the " passive girlfriend , " instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . it's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . john's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn't want any part of that . his mother stands beside her " big , strong husband " and is a passive female . finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . saving " varsity blues " from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . the scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn't overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . but leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . do we really need another high-school sports film ? no , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . " varsity blues , " no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . 
there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of " scream queen " in the early '80s . two of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween . the same " god , i'm scared , there's some guy in a mask coming after me " routine she did in john carpenter's classic , jamie lee copies here , with none of the urgency or suspense . terror train takes place on ( where else ? ) a train , charted by some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher education . most of them won't make it to med school , though , and it's obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , " i wish to hell they'd put a radio on that train . " the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee . from the beginning , he's talking his head off ( he tells one of his co-workers " think on this -- when's the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? " as if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles . of course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it . i forgot to mention the prologue . it's a party three years earlier , with the same group of students . two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he's going to get laid . they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed . she says , " kiss me , kenny , " and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver . ( " oh my god , they killed kenny ! you bastards ! " ) it's a sick trick , and one jamie lee wasn't let in on . she still hasn't forgiven the guy as they board the terror train ( " you asshole , you can't have a good time without hurting somebody ! " ) . the killing starts before the train even leaves the station . since it's new year's , everyone's wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we've seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one's looking . at least one of the characters says it's a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie . speaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train's most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield " as the magician , " who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music . then there's his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that . for all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing really worth watching . only die-hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it . and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse . i mean , when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station , anyway ? terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car . 
for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene . now , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow's super stardom in the acclaimed 'a better tomorrow' ) by moving to hollywood . i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them . chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt . his final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy . this he refuses do and runs . however , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job . cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations . some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring . the car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked . tut tut . the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music , ( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content . mia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun . director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow's excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots . chow's trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there's not even a toothpick in site . and as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that's damned unforgiveable . to round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow . it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video . this is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer . ( did he have no say so at all ? ) watch 'the killer' again and weep at the difference . review by chris hill . " there's room at the top , they are telling you still , but first you must learn how to smile as you kill , if you want to be like the folks on the hill . " 
when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games . why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw . this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack . the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the " outworld " , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity . the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined . here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation . how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , " i knew love would keep us together , " since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh . there are some seriously stupid things in this movie . take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the " inner winds " , generated by earth's magma flows . you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast . how fast ? as katana says , " you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . " what ? later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn " red " williams , otherwise known as " saber " on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu . how do we know this is where she went ? there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii . remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign . i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are . there's a lot of major flipping action , too . the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another . do they land and immediately get into the fighting ? does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ? do they collide in mid-air ? no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away . why did they need those metal balls to travel ? everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b . i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics . the movie's thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly . " ouch " was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one . you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next . it seems that's all there is in this movie . maybe it is . as i had mentioned , the acting is bad . there's not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny . after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , " you look good in mud . no , really , you do . " remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang . brian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv's the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it's more the script's fault than his own that he doesn't have anything original to say . the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half . another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene . all in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids . hey , just like the video game ! 
how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot's novel " the princess diaries " be anything but cute , harmless fun ? easy . take all the cute , harmless fun out of it . and while you're at it make it borrr-ring . that's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film " the princess diaries . " you couldn't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass . of growing , glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me ) . well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious . too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall's film ( garry made a couple of other " princess " movies-- " pretty woman " and " runaway bride " --but this one's way without julia roberts so maybe * that's * its problem ) . in addition to being predictable as molasses , " the princess diaries " has hardly got a laugh in it ( it's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) . marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn't working . . . and hardly * any * of " the princess diaries " works ( " works , " alas , implies cleverness and there's none of that here either ) . newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule " genovia " ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads ) . julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) . does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ? not really . consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets . also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky-looking best friend ( " welcome to the dollhouse " 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic/musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia's chauffeur-driven limousine at every intersection . a non-animated g-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product . lame , labored , and lamentable , " the princess diaries " is recommended for eight-and-a-half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it ( like potholes , the plague , and " the perfect storm " ) . 
sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . that isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . but the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them . first of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . 
i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days . for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . sherman has just invented a new " youth drink " that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the " buddy love " link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . pure and simple , the klumps is a failure . its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . people will be lined up around the block for it . the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie . i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . 
as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony . and , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer . in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal . his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division . lomax is soon given the case of his life . he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide . the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell . he works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) . but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story . it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed . but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm . quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago . freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed . the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts . the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer . the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax . unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere . granted , the film is very handsome-looking . you'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino . you'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties . you'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away . this was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot . as with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst . in the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background . his path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored . his actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known . pacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie . there is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited . the focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap . this movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time . however , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all . 
chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck . the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder . this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius . that would be pretty nasty . the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr . richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island . long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance . the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops . upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder . protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr . ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder . all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees . this proves to be tricky . among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle . they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing . to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice . director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie . when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it . perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice . take the villains , for example . they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen . they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways . the tag-team of gooding jr . and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is . frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man . i suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner . gooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! ' this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets . but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous . at least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character . the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted . to be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action . and i did chuckle a few times . one example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door . `you own this place ? ' the general asks . `yeah , ' ulrich says . `they call me darlene . ' these little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film . as a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing . sadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been . 
one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances . now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her . his reasons ? well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . . . i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) . eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . he essentially says to her , " you win " and hands her a ring . the audience should now hate this character . i did . then the meat of the plot presents itself . jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a " business proposition " . the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly . it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself " what is this , brewster's millions ? " . as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says " what is this , brewster's millions ? " it was quite surreal . something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his " business proposition " which i felt was good . at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman . when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them . as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . this goes on for the rest of the film . it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . my groans of disgust could be heard for miles . the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i'm still groaning . the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? ugh . 
capsule : godawful " comedy " that's amazingly shabby and cut-rate , and rather bereft of laughs . i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery . i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head . get some perspective . even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes . i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery . michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago . the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don't think i'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil . evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture . powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with . the basic gag , that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with . the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . . the movie's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions . one is dr . evil's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) . a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it's desperate rather than clever . instead of skewering the whole thing , it's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute . myers himself is also desperate : he's given an idea to play , not a character . plus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit " nineties " ) agent are a waste of time . i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one . with a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments . the movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes . the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap . my definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ? the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out . the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson's shorts and sent it sailing . 
i am a steven seagal fan . i only say this now because " mufti splenetik " isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his " my hands are sharp , nimble knives " thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . he's also put on quite a lot of weight . small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ? ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) . as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that " glimmer man " thing . an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . it's the other changes that disappoint . for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's " in living colour . " wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his " are you crazy " part of the dialogue with wasted zest . as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching . a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . is that a lot to ask of the seague ? too much . seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . we trusted him . we got to know him . now , betrayal . i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again . i'll try , but it won't be easy . if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . everybody makes mistakes once in awhile . 
it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters . this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world . the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( " heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . " ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers . godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations . that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious . the credits show us the origin of godzilla . in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard . sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ? the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable " discovery " sequence . this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype . . . ) when he discovers the telltale radar blip . people die . cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick . he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to " singin' in the rain . " it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie . no dice , bueller . from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint . every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it . as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , broderick is invaluable to the government . he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of " newsradio " cast members . broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard . " the radiation isn't an anamoly , " he announces , and lightning strikes . " i believe this is a mutated abberation , " he continues , and lightning strikes again . it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more . meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love . gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ? poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer . italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : " nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town . it's dog eat dog . " actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core . the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla . " i think i've got a bite , " he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him . you can guess what happens next . similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city . hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , " please don't tell me that's another parade . " please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with . mayor ebert is not pleased . played by the principal from " head of the class , " he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene . i guess the filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn't even bother to kiss ass . the problem is , if you're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny . dialogue like , " didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until after the election ? " followed by , " back off , gene , " just doesn't work for me . other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character's last name and frenchman jean reno's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york . there's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses . as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food . cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection . ( broderick : that's a lot of fish . ) that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them . yep , godzilla's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla . that's until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp . godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots . look no further than patillo's betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ? what have i become ? ) and the climactic " godzilla's nest " sequence in madison square garden . the main difference is , independence day was about the experience . it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters . godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna . yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla . that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie . 
wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy . there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story . what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner . the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? . the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat . the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound . theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad " no nudity " clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . kevin bacon ) is familiar with . the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life . that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . but i suppose we all need to put food on the table . mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) . quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws . the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school . a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) . they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . this is definitely not a character- based motion picture . not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . neve campbell gets to model the slutty look . denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit . and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) . columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks . 
senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise . granted , that one joke is initially amusing . when wayans's darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless . this sets up some showcase moments for wayans's gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp . but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale . once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness . wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration . senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this " serious " angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . unlike wayans's last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the " emotional " content of senseless is forced and unconvincing . any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl's romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind . once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him . but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television . 
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . ben kingsley ? " my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . the second punch comes from gal's past . back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . " however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin . kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming . when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . any local hood could have done what gal is needed for . additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . it is not a great plot . in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . it is an old plot dressed up to look new . if the plot is old , at least the style is creative . this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . we see one side of a person's faces . but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . yes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual " identities , " they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of " girl power . " but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . the film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- " scary " ( melanie brown ) , " baby " ( emma bunton ) , " sporty " ( melanie chisolm ) , " ginger " ( geri halliwell ) , and " posh " ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad " too much " ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant " mate " ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) . capped off by a live rendition of the girls' bouncy hit " say you'll be there , " a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? wrong . it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the " wacky " goings-on . spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a " dance bootcamp " scene , the girls sing the lyric " we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra " --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . ha ha . as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . baby's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out . there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being " ginger " or " scary " ? apparently , just their wardrobes . spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit , " wannabe . " the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . this section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . but this sloppy enterprise surely won't win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices' final hurrah in america . 
" have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? " obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released " urban legends : final cut " . this is another " scream " -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time . amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do . but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines . soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one . is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , ! a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ? this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting . it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain . the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly . in fact watching films like that after having watched " scary movie " is impossible keeping a serious face . several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding . and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing . it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century . how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ? it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them . they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence . however , director john ottman manages to make " urban legends : final cut " into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre . what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in " scream " , ottman takes seriously . for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be . it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect . even movies like " lost in space " and " mission to mars " seem spectacular in its shadow . we have not seen such waste of t ! ime and resources since " showgirls " ( 1995 ) . no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed . here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask . jennifer morrison ( " stir of echoes " ) is all right , and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script . in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools . if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood's golden days are over . rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment . let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend . 
tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . he goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city . there , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . there , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . of course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . although the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . it's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . there also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . in planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy . in nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all . towards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , the director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . and although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . however , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . in fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . the humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . the characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' nothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . he nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose . 
jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong . and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . hush is one such example . lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium . the film opens , as many so-called " psychological thrillers " do , by posing as a light drama . we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war . hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks . frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus . martha is , of course , the evil one . how do we know she's evil ? she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . on the other hand , helen is a good girl . the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . that's about it for character development . beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good . films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . 
perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it , it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth . the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . ) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship's stewards . the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment . the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies . surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up . " the show is over for this fella , " steve buscemi's character says towards the end . the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning . there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . the impostors runs 1 : 42 . it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . 
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon . now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development . hmmm . . . . okay . . . now on to my review of chill factor . plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects . when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people . critique : " speed on an ice-cream truck " is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one-tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension-filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for . this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr . , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe . my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously " written " , that we just had to crack up . that , and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2- , and you guessed it . . . 3 scenario ! and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters . . . . " elvis " and " nighshift " , oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes , it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel ) . it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr . got involved in this one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling project . did they actually think that it would boost their careers , or did they know that the script sucked , but discounted any fall from grace , knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ? most probably the latter . have you seen either fled or bulletproof ? well , despite the slight differences in plot , the essentials are basically the same here . you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people , having no choice but to work together to get somewhere , hating each other at first , but over time , learning to respect one another as individuals . yawn . add to that , the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black , drive black cars and black vans , and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head . not too conspicuous , eh ? call me a party-pooper , but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy , this film just doesn't even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining . one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside , and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island , do not a fun , buddy-action flick make . show cuba the money , everybody ! : ) little known facts about this film and its stars : this is not a little known fact or anything , but damn , is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great-looking actor johnny depp ? skeet's real-life nicknames include chester , skeeter and mosquito . he stands 6'1 " , was born in north carolina , and got married in 1997 to that sex-kitten actress from clay pigeons ( 7 . 5/10 ) , georgina cates . they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs . skeet has a long scar on his chest from open-heart surgery done when he was 10 to correct a ventricle defect . actor cuba gooding jr . was born in the bronx , new york . in 1984 , he break-danced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles . he stands 5'10 " . actress hudson leick , who plays one of the " bad guys/girls " in his movie , is better known from her role as " callisto " on the popular tv series " xena : princess warrior " . this film reportedly had a budget of $40 million ? ? i'm not exactly sure where all this money went , but it certainly did not register onscreen . interestingly enough , director hugh johnson , who makes his big screen debut with this film , was the cinematographer on the 1996 film white squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle , g . i . jane ( 6 . 5/10 ) . 
the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film . since june , i haven't been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha's " take on me " in his yellow miata . why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? honestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie . man , was i wrong . corky romano is one of those throwaway , clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots . fortunately for chris kattan's precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety . kattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny '80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans ( " you don't have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps . " ) . when his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges , his bungling , lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent , black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence . predictably , hijinks ensue . if the basic plot sounds bad , wait until you get into the inner-workings of this clunker . the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity . corky's fbi agent identity is named corky pissant ( " that's pronounced pees-ahn . it's french . " ) . he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom . and not a good sitcom , i mean . the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other's face . and in a scene taken straight from there's something about mary , corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . but it's not a complete disaster . the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments , including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren , a german shephard , and a kilo of cocaine . plus , berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie . and , it's nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work . unfortunately for those out there who can't truly appreciate animal or fart jokes , corky won't have much to offer you . so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv , asking , " who is corky ? " you can simply reply , " who cares ? " 
capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived . this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons . . . extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts . beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep . this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson . instead , they got john r . leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat . not a good choice . while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare . the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a . ) the director's style , b . ) the special effects , & c . ) the treatment of the story and characters . a . ) mr . leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion . i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on . but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping . apparantly , everybody can now fly . hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly . better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess . in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back . or at least let robin shou direct . . . b . ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad . i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious . had this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking . but in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished . c . ) now for the _really_ bad parts . i admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series . the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger . the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride . this could have been a really cool movie . it isn't . the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers . some of the plot elements are just plain stupid . how stupid ? take , for instance , how our heroes move around . they use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour . . . oh boy . . . even worse is the treatment of secondary characters . blink and you'll miss 'em . most characters had more depth in the video games . if you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ain't seen nothin' yet . a good 75% of the characters are introduced , kick somebody around a bit , then either die or are forgotten about . there's no explanation at all for this . and for the final blasphemy , the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for , the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie , lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of . . . ended . it almost made me weep . to sum it all up , rent it on video , and fast-forward through everything except the fight scenes . 
bats is this year's camp flick . with the world's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity . as for the rest of us , well . . . i'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway . follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot . i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based . it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats . when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate . it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious . why has he done this , you ask ? because , you see , it is apparently a scientist's job to make things " a little better , " even if that means the death of all mankind . so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world . of course , that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture . consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave . the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out . what do they do ? do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ? nope . they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes . what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes . we don't even get to see what's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick . all we know is that bats are attacking . how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery . a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some . of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it doesn't really go anywhere . most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like " i hate bats ! " some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept . i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners . playing such characters does not help actors' careers . still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is " so bad it's good , " you could do worse than bats . it does have a tremendous amount of camp value . i'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it . more power to them . 
a follow-up to disney's live-action " 101 dalmatians " that's better , more entertaining than the first ? just as unlikely . with " 102 dalmatians , " the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . 1996's " 101 dalmatians " certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film . what makes " 102 dalmatians " such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic " heroes " of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that . the dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated . bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in " men of honor . " jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . france's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in " 102 dalmatians " the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as " poopies , " par example ( and ad nauseum ) . the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . that done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . savvy holiday goers should skip " 102 dalmatians " and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . 
i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films . when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing . but it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron's whiny views of life and romance . tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood's most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively . baldwin's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse . jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems . sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out . ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it . annie is a happy woman . she is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content . but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it . five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you've got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet . at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity . here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five . the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory . sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell . but none of them can save the film from being a bore . its characters are dull and empty , its script isn't funny or particularly charming . the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue " sleepless in seattle , " whom she has never even seen . it's the kind of life decision that real people don't make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice . in essence , this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn't even exist . it's a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler . if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn't have to review it , you could just call me " asleep in philadelphia . " ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; 
this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james . dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom " doc " scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : " stand and deliver ! " owing to the increased occurrence of turpin's robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin's area of influence to bring him to justice . they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) . their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies . however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin . then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! there is no doubt that this is a 'sid james' carry on movie . he excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- don't lose your head' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques' small but effective role as the rector's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw's character appears only briefly in the film . the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the 'birds of paradise' and sporting a fake french accent . when her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! a carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie . the jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement . although nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions . none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here . just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres . 
i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday' . it's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football . unfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers . in altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics . we see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook . it grows tiresome and monotonous . yes , stone has pulled a brian depalma . matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go . tony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut . aging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad . when cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game . once in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field . nerves , you see . eventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc . - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like . and i believe it . there is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball . the problem with the director's visual approach is this : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate . football is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush . i guess he is mistaken . `any given sunday' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them . many football fans ( including one i attended with ) are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish' way stone has decided to present the game . in return , a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director's tampering . in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction . for instance , heated returns between d'amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci ( cameron diaz ) are enjoyable to watch . there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx , who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory . the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine , aaron eckhart , lauren holly , ann-margret and charlton heston ( in an extraordinarily brief appearance ) . unfortunately , too many big names are wasted - a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast . pacino makes some interesting progress with his character . you begin to identify with coach d'amato and the morals he is striving for . . . . but i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics . `any given sunday' is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique . and a very distant back seat , at that . 
we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer's character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an " a . " that's fair enough . all movies , like all school children , should be given the benefit of the doubt . the chance to succeed . after all , we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders . mountains can be moved , and good movies can be made . yeah right . children fail , as do films . as does director john boorman's latest . the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ( ed wood , true romance ) as the busty westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport . though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there , it's a tougher task to overlook the actress . she's a lightweight . as the first scene ( with narration ! ) demonstrates , she doesn't have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to show . she may give a stronger performance than , say , keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds , by not by much . beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film , thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur , hope and glory ) . he keeps the narrative moving , no matter how muddy the story--or the heroine--gets . why he chose arquette remains a mystery , though . maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies . but even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations . empty exoticism . the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix , combining lush jungle photography with bad blue-screen work . also odd is the obvious dubbing . done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign ? and , is it my mistake , or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers ? ? doo doo doo doo . [ " twilight zone " theme , or opinion of movie . you be the judge . ] 
capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness . potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring . claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice . it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e . movie , where s . f . e . means so f * * * ing earnest . movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing . claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk . claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat . claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior . obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk . the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness . the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand . the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively . ( ugh ! ) the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads . all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened . we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet . the problem with claire . . . is not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it's handled . why is it that any " serious " ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ? the way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids . many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting . look at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire . what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants . 
first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it's been given . for those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over . hopeful still ? well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , " what do you think of my butterfly ? " . butterfly ? , i asked myself , what butterfly ? ! and then it hit me . . . the scene had been snipped ! damn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! so . . . no naked teri hatcher . forget about that . okay ? now . . . heaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch ) . everything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat . the plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt . what they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues . when robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins 'poking his nose where it don't belong' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he's going to get . the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide . as dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat . . . no seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man's hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a roof-top chasing scene . he's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression . three-quarters of the way through the show , while you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you'll want to beat on him a little yourself . on the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie's only endearing character . eric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box . and lest we forget teri hatcher's role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv's " adventures of lois & clark " . . . she is totally ridiculous as rocque's manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who's trying to get back at an employer who hasn't been giving her enough days off . it's probably safe to say that her day job beckons . and at the end of our day , none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery . the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . 
`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . i chuckled incessantly , all the way home . let me share . the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report . despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization . soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account . yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense . unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting . it's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . . but not the script . `the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm . afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar . will they never take this watch off ? and what if they forget it by their bedside ? perhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed . on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . gee , why not member t-shirts ? but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions . they are given official skull paddles . when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . facing the opposite way means a disagreement . wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? hell no . they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong . i'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest . the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout . but not entirely . accomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them . and then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor . mcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) . i pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors . the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better . let's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character . paul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son . walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) . some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics . it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one . or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style . it makes you wonder why he didn't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart' and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight' aren't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , `the skulls' gets little accomplished . the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical . the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick . instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage . we've seen it all before , and better . `the skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ? boneheaded' seems just too generous . 
i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering . if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . it has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee . that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . and you could just smell the disaster brewing . if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up . ostensibly , it's a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) . when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called " an alan smithee film " -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it . among the parties interviewed are the film's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them . it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes . what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times . michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade . the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word " feminist " as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film . by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as " bad a-- " and " badder a-- " , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified . those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn . not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears . the producer is a " liar " who " slept in the white house ; " the media are " maggots " and " leeches " working for publications like " the new york slimes " and " newsleak " ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don't miss the joke ) . it doesn't even matter that eszterhas tags " penile implant " after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation . this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career . pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven " satire " of excess and ego . it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees . 
there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . the badness of patch adams is stupefying . it's confounding . i can't believe a film can be this bad . and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself . while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people . he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) . but the film fails fundamentally in execution . every scene swells with grand , " emotional " music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad . later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . real drama is character-based . you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness . real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . that's why patch adams is not real drama . it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score . sentimentality like this is indeed bad . but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . you see , patch is a really great student . he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating . but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . " why don't we see patients until the third year ? " he bursts out every three seconds . well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . most of us have to study . and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death . oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to " prevent death , " but to " improve the quality of life ! " yes ! that is true ! and you can not do that without studying . you can not do that without going to medical school . what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . follow the rules ? bah ! who needs the rules ! only uptight doctors follow the rules . the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . a free clinic . in the middle of the forest . where patients can be taken to be helped . for free . how will patients be transported to the free clinic ? will it have an emergency room ? or is it just for mental patients ? and who , may i ask , will pay for it ? the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent . reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . i know nothing about him . if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . patch adams is the cheapest of them all . 
isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you can't think of much to say about it other than " it sucks " ? one of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie . i can't seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although " boring , " " stupid " and " absurd " doesn't amount to much of a review . a shame . i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate . but c'est la vie . here goes nothing . i'll keep it short . i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee . the film's fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a particular movie . hill's and mgm's actions were prudent . when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident , a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer , for some reason ( james spader ) is forced to take command . the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and , on arrival , picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony . one of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means . this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it . another one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups . evidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger . how ? why ? the movie never bothers to explain . soon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli . to be honest , i don't even remember exactly why . i just remember that i didn't care . supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas , such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb , but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing . in fact , everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set . well , the effects are good , though there's hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i'm not sure whether that's so remarkable an accomplishment . the performances are hardly worth talking about . i'm not even sure i can call what's here " performances , " though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger . james spader is not a bad actor , but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i've seen in a while , mostly because he isn't given a character with a personality . the action scenes are just as bland , since they're pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren't particularly entertaining the first time around . and since the action scenes are everything to this movie , it's pretty much dead in the water . and for the life of me , i can't figure out why it's called supernova . 
if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! indeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . it's difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . but at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? first , the movie gives us an introductory premise . huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . oooh . . . scary ! secondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . third , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) . he operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . finally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . they are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are . during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs . spotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster . yet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds . this is nothing more than a by-the-book action film . their realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . the corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . yet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary " boo " moments . but most of it is just outright silly . and this film is unusually gory too . monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . he screams horribly as the monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . additionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . the mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . to be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . it's moronic fun at best . so , if you're hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot . 
synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? it's hard to speculate . most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel " thriller " ( i use the term " thriller " loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad . the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . there's really not much to say . the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience . most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent . he is so horrible in this role that one can't help but be amused . the plot sucks . nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . the dialogue stinks . a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know . everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits . as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being " assistsant to foley artist . " someone could have used an editor ! to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes . playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here . i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie . why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ? as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film . if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else . 
" we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . " starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung taiwan , 24/12/99 . the millenium approaches . an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city . sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus . the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners . the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time . residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap . this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas . the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that . the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background . instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities . the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible . it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background . the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's . one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room . this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways . example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole . the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up . this is what passes for meaningful communication . and they say romance is dead . much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are . there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people . they are ciphers . instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles . ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . ) offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china ) . she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights . sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man . these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail . when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless . astaire and rogers this is not . even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring . the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium . others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life . the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry . witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty . american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions . foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art . the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation . if so , he succeeds . perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't . if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it . 
in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . low budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . unfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . instead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting . all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time . 
come on hollywood , surprise me . stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . personal , because his niece is one of the victims . it's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist . freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to " dominate " these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well , you know the rest . a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story . perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue . so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh please ! kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here . one , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting . two , the script has no sense of humour . three , while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn't even half as good as the idea . thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story . we can't feel her rage . some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type , but these conversations barely register . and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this . for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying . young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead . but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? not much , and you can hardly blame him . there's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling . but the script is beyond rescue . what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up . complacency rules : it's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue . the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren't free . . . . . 
plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who's planning a bank heist . mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy's jazz club . they're tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption . meanwhile wendy's sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy's late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues the review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work . unfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the " what the hell where they thinking " category that takes up 98% of the rest . but , hell , it's not as if he's the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller . leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on . though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut . the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two . which is unfortunately , the other main story isn't any great shakes either . the second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled . at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that didn't improve on repeated viewing . there is no doubt that this film's achilles heel is its script . as for the rest of the cast , it's a mixed bag . john flaus , one of australia's most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder . although he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off . dominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isn't given a whole lot to do . pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes . i must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element . cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo . the bar is an oppressive red , like all of it's patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night . if only deborah parson's script could have supported this idea better . having two director's ( colin south & john tatoulis ) doesn't help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it doesn't pull away to anything else . it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance . it has no reason to it ; it's just bad direction . and , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep , it's tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it's just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed . 
there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it's just that none of them happen to be actors . the stars i'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie's " outer space " ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . yes , in terms of acting , the star power is . . . well , more like a falling star . kinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead . lost in space , as if you really didn't know , is based on the 60's sci-fi television series of the same name . it's the year 2058 , and earth's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . john robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . earth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . john's family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) . despite everyone's reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space . unknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission . dr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to " destroy robinson family " ! when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . as for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground . it's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? chabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium . if you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! that's just her normal voice ! in yet another example of a " friend " faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod . graham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film . hurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left . if hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill . johnson isn't dull , he's just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody's ass all the time . want an example of how cool this kid can be ? how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? hey , don't laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment . but alas , if you thought a character couldn't be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known ) . why hire an actress ? they could've had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it . now that would've had some pizzazz ! lost in space luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could have . the special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse . unfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy . while the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn't find in most modern sci-fi films . contact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you'd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens . then again , with an ending like this film has , it's obvious a sequel is already being considered . what an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two . the attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups . well , danger potential movie goers ! danger ! this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity . 
well , here's a distasteful , thoroughly amateurish item that , surprisingly , was actually a box-office hit at the time of its release . after just viewing the film for the first time , my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movie ? it is cheap , idiotic , unfunny , and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was . at least some smut would have livened things up a bit . " porky's , " tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid . women , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ) . their plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky's , which they are able to get into using fake id's . after they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building . for these four teenage guys , this means war on porky's . " porky's , " ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level . as a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough . as a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat . as a look back at the 1950's , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave . and as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore . one of the most offensive things about , " porky's , " is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers . the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool . that sure is revealing information . the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark . the women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people . for example , the two gym teachers , mrs . balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of . mrs . balbricker is a gruff , no-holds-barred , overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness , and , in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved , honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog . there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny , only humiliating . to prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is , compare it to other more serious 80's films about teenagers , and it looks even worse in comaprison . any of the john hughes pictures , such as 1984's " sixteen candles , " or , 1985's " the breakfast club , " put , " porky's , " at an even greater shame . those films actually dealt with serious teen matters , but remained a great deal funnier , thanks to their bright and truthful writing . and heck , if , " porky's , " wanted to be a teenage sex movie , i'd take 1982's " fast times at ridgemont high , " or 1982's " the last american virgin , " over this any day of the week . director bob clark is not a bad director . two years after he made , " porky's , " he directed the nostalgic holiday classic , " a christmas story . " i would forgive him for this misfire , in fact , if it wasn't for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay . just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage , and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world , is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in , " porky's . " 
post-chasing amy , a slew of love-triangle movies : this month we have kissing a fool , co-starring amy's own lee , and april brings us the object of my affection , which may as well be titled chasing allan , for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate . ( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it , that film stars schwimmer's friend jennifer aniston . ) if only kevin smith could write them all . . . schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max , who falls in love with his best friend jay ( lee ) 's book editor samantha ( avital ) a mere twenty-four hours after meeting her . they are soon engaged , and max , because of his own raging libido , grows suspicious of samantha's fidelity . he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book , to " test her " . the trouble is , jay might be secretly in love with her . to stretch this flat , sitcom premise to feature length , the plot is framed by a climactic wedding , at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale--the events leading up to the nuptials--to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend . hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film ; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue ; and lee , poor lee , is miscast . so hysterically funny in chasing amy , here he is forced to repress his comic instincts : to swear , to yell , to talk about oral sex . . . the script's idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a " sensitive man " , and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he's stewing over his girl trouble . as for avital , an israeli actress , she is warm and sweet , but we don't know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things . she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer , who plays schwimmer's assistant and personal temptress , turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo . there are a handful , a smattering , of good scenes in kissing a fool . i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club , during which jay gets up and asks " has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her ? " over and over until he's booted off stage . there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's on the page . kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke-machine friends that spawned schwimmer's movie career , so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back . 
if you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he's familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . aside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . branagh proves once again that he's a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . the problem is that he's the same character allen always plays , a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch . i mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? -- he hates his work , and he can't be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it's pretty hard to care about him . in addition , isn't allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him ? i know he is , but he didn't do it in celebrity . the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . davis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they're not likable people . only famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon's new novel , has any life . the men in the picture don't do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . what's really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its " themes " are . allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie about the way " normal " people look at celebrities . the main problem with this is that the character with whom we're supposed to identify , simon , is not a " normal " guy -- he's just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . in addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , " it's interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! " ) . celebrity is arguably allen's biggest misfire to date . it does have a few good scenes -- theron's super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . but celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen's point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . i , for one , don't enjoy feeling like an outsider . 
billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy . he tries to infuse some life into it , but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication . sammy ( billy crystal ) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes . he's separated from his wife , serena ( kathleen quinlan ) , and down to his last serious client . . . in a low-budget film shooting in romania . but in a turn of bad luck , sammy wrecks his car . . . only to be mysteriously saved by a giant ( gheorghe muresan ) . but this giant has a heart of gold . he leads a solitary life , helping out the monks at a local monastery . his only longing is for his long lost love , lilianna ( joanna pacula ) , who has since moved to america . sammy , seeing a golden ticket , convinces max to become an actor ( represented by sammy , of course ) , and come back to america . and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job , with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before max's nose . but slowly sammy's deceptions begin to haunt him . but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned . the humor in my giant isn't the world's greatest . mostly , it falls under the category of " boy . . . he's so big ! " , and that can only go so far , no matter how hard the talent tries . still , its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments . the film's best moment ( and that's not saying much ) is a bit part by steven seagal , playing himself . between executive decision and this , all of seagal's best roles have been cameos . maybe he should consider a change of work : steven seagal , the character actor ! gheorghe muresan isn't a natural actor at all , and his thick cotton-mouthed accent certainly doesn't help . in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature . originally , the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant . andre also had a hefty accent , but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride . . . something muresan should have studied for some pointers . why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies ? he's proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be , and yet , like a glutton for punishment , he keeps coming back . that doesn't mean we have to . 
this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . elsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . if i had to list a reason why . . . . but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . adam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . one day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . elsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . morse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . so far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . good music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . it appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . until then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . the woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . somehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend . frankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . after this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . if i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . it might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it . i don't . . avoid . 
one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain . " so , are we all going to die ? " the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town . the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough . and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so . populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors . one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture . besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie . graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines . director mikael salomon's staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening . the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr . 's dark and ugly cinematography . the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water . onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie . christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom . edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie . coming to their " rescue " is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman . he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan . the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom . along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix-weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver . the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest . they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake . christopher young's emotionless score for the film has a single trait , ear-shattering loudness . the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town . the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns . the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly . when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees . counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other . the show has a single , but unprintable , good line . betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen-pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter . the show concludes with a sickening set of twists . the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad . hard rain runs 1 : 37 . it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers . ( the two families behind us shockingly had a half-dozen preschoolers among them . ) 
gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie's ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement . as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true . gord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . " tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green's primal scream . so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ? it's clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) . while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there's little about green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else . the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols' 'problem' ( green's put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times . green's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer ) are inspired comedy . but what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ? a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs . younger ( by three years ) brother freddy's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title and green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn't make sense . by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film's end , the overall effect is numbness . while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child's self esteem , it's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy . rip torn , what were you thinking ? 
not so long ago , men by the names of peckinpah , ford , leone , and eastwood made westerns . real westerns . these were some of the best films of the twentieth century . those days are gone . now we have crap like wild wild west to pass for the western . and that record is not improved with the unbearable tale of american outlaws . outlaws is yet another re-telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b-movie king james g . robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor ) . delayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher's tigerland ) as the bad-ass jesse james . alas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch . the spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended . but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads . the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people . along the way , the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang , who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live . they rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background . the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card . the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell . after a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds . and his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal . combined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever-popular pg-13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring . the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film . not to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws . instead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild west -- tales which went out of style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago . 
synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system . the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris . comments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film . both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) . interestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively . this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction . it's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality . unfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie . virtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) . the film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses . many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly . the cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles . jeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character . carrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise . meschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either . virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background . in other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch . the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt . this turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either . don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch . 
i cried during _babe_ . i admit it . the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a " children's film " --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . such , my friend , is the power of cinema . when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . they can't possibly drop the ball on this one . can't miss . can't possibly miss . they missed . what went wrong ? after much thought , i supply three general rules . ( 1 ) don't let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall's dreadful " preacher's wife " ) . betty thomas worked wonders with " the brady bunch movie " , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn't quite work here . it's as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b . take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80's kirk cameron show . ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i . e . , " con air " ) . it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time . it's even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don't get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he's in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . but there's little humor here . that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig . even the mouth is ill-synched . ( 3 ) don't let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . there's a certain timing that's mandatory in comedy . to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson's creature shop , is a travesty . this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren't well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . here , betty thomas is clearly over her head . i wish i could commend the special effects , but they're merely average . count the number of times where the animal's mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched . this is less a " babe " and more of a " look who's barking " clone . you may be wondering , 'how does eddie murphy fare ? ' well , he came back with the exceptional " nutty professor " , and i don't doubt he can come back again . here , he's tied into a straight man and given little to do . the exceptions are when he fears he's going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you'd expect routine that he's more adept at . it's unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . after all this , what's left ? butt jokes . a _lot_ of butt jokes . i guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone-faced . if there's a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt . 
so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men , " 1995's " grumpier old men , " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i . e . " grumpiest old men " ) . so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e . " the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series . the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . . . then hilarity ensues . well , a few chuckles ensue anyway . neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . unlike the original play/movie , " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy . it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse . ( you can add lemmon's " my fellow americans , " i . e . " grumpy old presidents , " to that list , too . ) let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ) . 
you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the " odd couple ii " sneak preview . they were as happy a group of men as i've ever encountered . " what a great movie , " exclaimed one gent at the urinal , " everything was so true ! " " yeah , " laughed a man standing next to him , " i drive as slow as that one guy did . my kids give me holy hell for it ! " " and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , " chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife . if you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , " neil simon's the odd couple ii " may be just the film for you . others will likely be less charitable . while " the odd couple ii " is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt . simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri . the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years . the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport . they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of " wacky " adventures on the road . jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob . while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : " grumpy old men , " " grumpier old men " and " out to sea . " still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch . matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons . lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of " phnah ! phnah ! " despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together . unfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom . one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club . if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements . burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot . between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs . i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing . i came up with four " god-damns , " three " shitheads " and two " fucks . " the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word . it's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise . one running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held . at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word " san . " the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing . one of the oldest maxims of film-going is " beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . " " neil simon's the odd couple ii " is no exception to the rule . while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater . of course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my " young-whippersnapper " ass to boot . one thing's for sure , though . they'll never catch me in a car chase . 
even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf's tribe . let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that's about its only asset . the best word to describe this film is " asinine . " the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules . the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist . the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . finally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work . once upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college . he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a " lost tribe " somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished . shortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own . now , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings . when he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the " shelmikedmu " . to provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb . soon , much to krippendorf's surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon . but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud . the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt . unfortunately , it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . meanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative . the acting in underwhelming . dreyfuss has definitely not given his " all " to the role of james krippendorf . alongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv's dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else . this quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie . no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen's daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels . i know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of titanic , but seems much longer . most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . if there's any upside , it's that i don't see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue . krippendorf's tribe will quickly become extinct . 
plot summary : the year is 2024 . the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod . the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid . connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope . on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a " terrorist " organisation . they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up . connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? ) . they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off . he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland . both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment . connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield . katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander . if you have never seen it . being a fan of highlander and mr . connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening . i wish it had been quicker . i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said . the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching . the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance . maybe they could pull it off . instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film . it's as if they are different people with the same names . witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of " who wants to live forever , when love must die " gone to ? the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out . the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before . putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying . i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill . why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ? i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first . to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world's worst shot . meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection . as for " bad guys , " we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems . no more assassins are sent . katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . has he no more assassins ? has he no better ? why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) . he seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that evil , just stupid and violent . we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo . so much for plot and characters . the music is atrocious . it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . bring back queen . there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) when connor played a queen track in a juke box . i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . the acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered " there can be only one " this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . so why 2/10 ? visually the film is interesting at all times . it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning . add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ? his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * i'd * have done it for 12 million . oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard . 
the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society , ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , ' gets me every time . unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film , `patch adams , ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact . from the surface `patch adams' looks very promising . it's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people . when the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital . in a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it's here that he finds how much he loves working with people . so he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school . right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable . he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry . shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) . they , along with patch's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people . once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can't graduate and kicks him out of school . patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court . it's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor . i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it . it seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie . considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother . not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama . robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels . but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams' is barely average . 
a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars . what is the point of this ? i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far . to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace . wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time . the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game . i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie . it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though . freddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair . wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie . this was definitely his worst performance to date . after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . ( for now anyway . ) christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth . blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there . his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this . blair is under the command of " angel " , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd " maniac marshall " , played by matthew lillard . matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too . his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie . the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth . this plot is very flimsy , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all . this explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on . the acting is horrible in wing commander . many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless . the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it . the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music . the special effects are very unrealistic . when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them . the explosions look very unrealistic as well . a ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second . this is very unrealistic . music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time . the music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding . after we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film . blair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft . for the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space . it is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time . it's not much fun to watch at all . if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home . at least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it . the bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox ! 
the spy game is up . you can thank charlie's angels -- the movie -- for that . when did banality and pandering become okay ? just steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that's a movie ? charlie's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i've seen in ages . charlie's angels is dumb . just plain dumb . as we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie . they all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don't seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion . and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party . the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company . of course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe . the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels' hair . the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie's manservant , or , more to the point , the angels' pimp . the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke's long-lost brother . charlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight . nothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels' actions . it feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one . diaz is a knucklehead . barrymore is the " dangerous one , " mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role . liu is just . . . lucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit . the list of movies from which charlie's angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing . the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan's movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv's friends . it's a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year's favorite , go . then again , what can you expect from a director known solely as " mcg . " there is no camp value in the film , no interesting main characters , no invigorating action scenes , no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players . note to hollywood : next time , let's leave the tv shows on the tv . 
starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for " alf " : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . insert proverbial downward spiral here . permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . but permanent midnight is mostly soulless . when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . is this hollywood . . . california ? ) i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . so much for the moral of that story . temporary midnight is more like it . -bill chambers ; september , 1998 
since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama " schindler's list " and directed 1993's intelligent " searching for bobby fischer , " his new film , " a civil action , " should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , " a civil action " is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes . jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water . suddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , " a civil action " is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . watching the film , i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 1997's far , far superior film " the sweet hereafter , " which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . not only was the plotting similar to " a civil action , " but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful " a sweet hereafter " was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . in " a civil action , " however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta's lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn't appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . you've got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what " a civil action " does . to be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . aside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . i could say the performances were good , but who's fooling who ? since every character is one-dimensionally written , no one's acting abilities are challenged in any way . travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that's about all he does . duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture's final scene , as a judge ? she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , " a civil action " seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . 
sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood ) . the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and says that his confession was coerced from the region's tough , black cop ( lawrence fishburne ) . watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough , but the plot's a joke . there's no logic at work here . tone is also an issue--there is none . director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say . is it a statement on human rights ? is it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ? glimcher never tells . instead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that the audience won't notice what's missing . just awful . the madness of king george 107 min . / not rated ========================== still wondering who nigel hawthorne is ? then check out his oscar- nominated work in the madness of king george , still playing in both raleigh and chapel hill . stage director nicholas hytner , in a remarkable screen debut , has adapted alan bennett's 1991 tragic comedy to fine effect . sumptuous-looking and only mildly stuffy , the film charts the madness that plagued king george iii ( hawthorne ) almost 30 years into his reign . a man of no importance 98 min . / rated " r " ====================== in suri krishnamma's a man of no importance , albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it's a shame when the film gets so serious around him . his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde . he reads to his riders , and once a year , with their help , he tries to stage one of the author's plays . this year it's " salome . " for about an hour , there's a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working-class stiffs . conflict arises , but it's small stuff--an administrator from the bus company here , an outraged catholic pork butcher ( michael gambon ) there . but with finney at the wheel , so to speak , the film rolls smoothly over these plot points--just like the gorgeous leland double-decker bus in the story . where things get serious is toward the end of the film , when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would , and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride . the twist makes sense--and helps paint a complete picture of finney's character--but the trip to get there betrays the light , airy atmosphere of what had come before . it's not a fatal misstep , mind you , and it doesn't send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity . it's just a turn off . dr . strangelove 93 min . / not rated =============== mein fuhrer ! the most fun that * i * had last month was in durham , at the carolina , at a mid-week screening of stanley kubrick's pitch-black comedy dr . strangelove ( or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb ) . the 1964 film stars peter sellers ( in three roles ) , george c . scott , sterling hayden , and slim pickens . their antics brought the house down , which , to my surprise , was packed by an audience younger than the film . 
one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? " i'm wondering the same thing . i feel like i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . " it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't . i just didn't . surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? no , but i expected something . a funny joke . a clever prank . a plot development . anything . the movie never delivers . you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . " detroit rock city " is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization . the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . that's it . there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . they have a garage band . they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . they have tickets , they lose them . they get more tickets , they lose those too . they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . there's not much more to it . frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already . it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . then again , " maximum overdrive " had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . " detroit rock city " doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's " highway to hell " sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) . it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood . people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . i would recommend that those who felt seasick at " the blair witch project " stay far away from " detroit rock city , " because the witch has got nothing on this baby . i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since " armageddon . " and what about that script ? it's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard . if it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . the jokes in " detroit rock city " rarely are . in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it " comedy . " there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , " see ? funny ! " look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . see ? funny ! look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . twice . see ? funny ! look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . see ? funny ! a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves . they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . that's it , i've said enough about this movie . it's a waste of time and money . i liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack . i hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . you want to see this concept executed well ? go rent roger corman's 1979 classic " rock n' roll high school . " it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . yes , go rent that , and skip " detroit rock city , " which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . 
i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas . with the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve . only this toy was made for $115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys , falls apart within an hour after playing with it . the product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby ! no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release . i come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular . i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy . phantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10 . nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable . even the special effects seem rather bland . the story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game . sw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far . with a title like sw e1 : tpm , lucas has one big head on those shoulders . i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie , although , that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours . pm is one long headache . 
" mandingo " has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , " a trashy potboiler " that " appeals only to the s&m crowd . " actually , i think " mandingo " is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . it's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his " bed wench , " the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had " pleasured " her before he did . of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a " white lady , " had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . judging only by the plot , " mandingo " is pure sexploitation . the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . when " mandingo " was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . dramatically , " mandingo " is weak and unfocused , and historically it's mostly confused . if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but " mandingo's " overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . some tried to write off " mandingo " as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it's not that easy . " mandingo " was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as " the bible " ( 1966 ) , the remake of " king kong " ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated " dune " ( 1984 ) . the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " ( 1954 ) and " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as " the narrow margin " ( 1952 ) . the script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on " serpico . " james mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . so why is " mandingo " so bad ? a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( " yessuh , massuh " ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( " fer whut're you gittin' outta bed ? " ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( " if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! " ) . fleischer's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . despite its exploitative nature , " mandingo " was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . even classics such as " gone with the wind " ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . " mandingo " reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . but all this is constantly undermined by the film's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . with a little more maturity and different handling , " mandingo " might have been an effective , worthwhile film . while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler's script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but " mandingo " never does it . steven spielberg touched on that same topic in " schindler's list " ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . the difference between that film and " mandingo " is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . " mandingo " is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its " trashy potboiler " nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . 
working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . the problem is , of course , that there aren't many good roles available for black women . take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve's bayou , and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . as a result , for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of " free lobotomy " lab experiment . woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . her latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . now , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr . right , and that he'll be a virgo . later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . it's not love at first sight , however . things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a " quiet " dinner . in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad " white " movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it's only fair that we get a " black " effort of the same low caliber . as in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . the question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? in a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . in woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . sadly , that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . despite exuding charm from every pore , there's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson's script . since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . 
humanities quest for knowledge never ends . so a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe . the party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) . early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . they agree to give him a ride to the next village . he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe . very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . we don't have to wait too long for the giant snake . she just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course . our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard . no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell . our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp . enjoy ! so much for the first attempt to catch her . but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake . too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition . one by one she goes after the others . eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure . the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned . however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring . whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh . the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster . her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . mostly we don't see the act of devouring . but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . the animatronics are somewhat more believable . but that didn't work for the strangling scenes . don't go see the movie for the f/x . they are everything but up-to-date . the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway . what kind of audience is the target group for this movie ? hard to say . this can't be a serious horror movie , or can it ? see for yourself . 
the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make movies fun to watch . then there are the bad twists . you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . screwed perfectly suits the latter description . what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . whoops . screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) . when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping . of course , everything that could go wrong does . the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes . at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : " no , you idiot ! " i'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i'm also talking about the cops in this film . a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . they give real cops bad names . also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . he just didn't belong in this movie . macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte . if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel . otherwise , don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money . 
hello kids . today the movie studios want to take over my critical review , and somehow persuade you that _armageddon_ , the summer's biggest blockbuster , is a film for everybody . and remember , if a film is for _everybody_ , and if it makes the most money for the summer , it _must_ be good , right ? armageddon is a comedy , with a capital " c " . it stars bruce willis , who has a hundred one-liners ! it has a tiny rock land directly in the middle of a heated argument in new york city ! ! and , chuckle , chuckle , one of those new yorkers , _survives_ , with charcoal all over his face ! ! snorkle , * sniff * , hiccup . and it has steve buscemi as a _genius_ who wants to work for an oil rig ? knee-slap ! ! isn't this just so , so , funny ! ? armageddon also has romance , with a capital " r " . it has a tender moment between * forbidden lovers * ben affleck and liv tyler , with , with , animal crackers ! and it has will patton as a long lost husband trying to reunite with his separated wife and child , who thinks he's a salesman ! gurgle , * sniff * , awwwww . and it has steve buscemi spewing more one-liners about minors and strippers . umm , moving right along . . . armageddon also has lots of action , with a capital " a " . not just any action sequence would do . it must have _original_ action sequences that are designed to thrill . like , drill , darn it , drill ! ! ! and , let's have inept people destroy the mir space station ! ! can't you hear your heart beating ! ? and steve buscemi goes crazy and starts shooting at people ! ! what drama ! ! lastly , armageddon is out there to save the planet , with a capital " p " . this can't be any old thriller--we must have an asteroid , the size of texas head straight for earth ! ! and , and , we must have beautiful scenic worldwide shots , like paris , blown up . and , and , we must have peoples of all colors , nations , and religions , join hand in hand for one final , hopeful , hug . the final sequence , where muslims in prostrate worship stand up--in domino fashion--to cheer the victory , filled me with such emotional goo that i wanted to , to , to rip the screen into shreds ! ! i mean , i mean , cheer for ecstatic joy ! ( it was over ) . comedy . " c " . romance . " r " . action . " a " . planet . " p " . okay , kids , what does that spell ? seriously , folks . any film that could take the indie-films' most valuable talents , and throw it all away with a bruce willis vehicle , a hundred-million dollar budget , but have cheap-o sets and lousy special effects , is , bottom line , living proof that hell exists , and has made a multi-picture deal with universal . in the midst of all the action , the terseness , the one-liners , the fake sets , the overall waste of time , i recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician ( " malloy , give me a reading " ) . remember him ? he was a principal player in last year's _in the company of men_ , a film that was more powerful , shocking , terrifying , funny , and shocking than _armageddon_ could ever aspire to be . _armageddon_ cost over $100 million to make . _itcom_ cost a paltry $30 , 000 . need i say more ? 
the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow , self-absorbed and self-indulgent . in other words , they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts . 54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco , studio 54 , the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled , photographed and pampered . the difficulty with 54 , which was written and directed by mark christopher , is that his script takes no point of view . christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54's hallmark . he keeps an uninvolved distance , thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists . the movie's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell , the famous owner of the nightspot . he is part rebel , part dreamer , part shrewd entrepreneur . he's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele , yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs . myers , in his first straight character part , is in turn appealing and appalling . at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation , then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash . the story is told by shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe ) , a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple . shades of john travolta's brooklyn-bound tony in saturday night fever . eventually , shane does come to new york , attracts rubell's eye and is admitted to the promised land . his looks get him a job as a busboy , and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender , where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous . shane's dream is to meet soap star julie black ( neve campbell ) , a fellow garden stater . but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up , it's no big deal . the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent . 54 is a very cold , uninvolving movie . it's all strobe lights and glitz , all substance . it's sort of like the musical era it covers . 
some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . gloria is her latest disaster . babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . " be a man , " his father lectures him sternly . " don't trust nobody . not no broads . nobody . " most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . add in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . ( " say you're my baby , " kevin coos demandingly . " i'm not gonna , " gloria pouts back . ) the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? if you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , " you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . " gloria runs 1 : 48 . it is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the " who cares about plot " summer movie . a loose remake of the 1954 " classic " japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . the script isn't just " dumbed down , " it's lobotomized . godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . that's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible . this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . stargate was a financial success . independence day was a runaway hit . and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . godzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close . there's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . frankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning . there's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting . with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of " adrenaline moments " capable of getting the audience involved in the action . in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . in nick's words , godzilla is " a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . " as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring . the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . he could climb the empire state building . at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : " ebert , " the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and " gene " ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . ebert's re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , " thumbs up for new york . " the siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it's used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . and , although the " characters " don't serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . this is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . that's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren't a-list names . then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . ultimately , it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . tristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . it may also be word-of-mouth-proof . those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it's like spitting into the wind . emmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . it's probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had . 
wolfgang petersen's latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it's going to hurt ? quite a bit . ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn't really much of a story to tell . basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of " the storm of the century . " how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? not nearly enough . so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . i have yet to read sebastian junger's the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who's always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . it is not the all-star cast's fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . allen payne's character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he's never given any lines ! are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? fichtner's character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know what he's doing there , where he's from , or who he's supposed to be . the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene " you know what would look good on you ? me ! " ooooh real creative ) . as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . i can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . this is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . i guess i'll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? 
tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , " look ! art ! " ) , although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . they're not real , sympathetic , or believable . i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious . for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . 
about an hour or so into " the jackal , " a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out " i hope she gets killed now ! " at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like . when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark . every year , a couple films like this are released . you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster " the saint , " which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun " the peacemaker , " featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . " the jackal " tries to mix both elements . and you thought " the saint " was bad . " the jackal " is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , " the day of the jackal , " which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or is he ? after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from " romeo + juliet " ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . the script of " the jackal " is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on . is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? or is it a combination of both ? " the jackal " aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . the supporting characters are worse . sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . what is poitier doing here ? he's one of the best living actors ! does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? diane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do . the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . there are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . doesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? geez ! is there anything good here ? well . . . a couple things . i did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is " the jackal . " director michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior " rob roy " ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( " clear and present danger , " which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but " the jackal " is an example of when they go completely wrong . 
among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . unfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . the actors that play them don't help either . that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . 
i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship . the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant . in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . it's a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . convinced despite his reservations that it's time to " sh * t or get off the pot , " jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy's 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist . screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees . it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development . by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . the blandly nice o'donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don't even let him ; zellweger's anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem . nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to . the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity . it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions . we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse . the bachelor is love among the mannequins . 
sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began . of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film . disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous . it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex . it's a suspense film with no suspense . it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of . it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits . our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden . he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself . steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally . the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends . marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject . as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) . gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people . so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it . by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense . disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg . i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting . he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out . evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work . rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization . and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally " explained . " there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening . they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures . the doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) . much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria . up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown . for instance , he points to the " nerds , " who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops . it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered . most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , " bite me ! " anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . the acting is largely a waste of talent . marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . stahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn't good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that cool . disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . i'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . it's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it's an uninspired lump of a film . it sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . 
this movie stinks ! although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss . i knew i was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we see a detailed close-up of warrant officer paul brenner's ( john travolta ) military identification card and it is the wrong color . this might seem like a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow . and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training . or what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision . how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through . for example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating . the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing . but instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him . duh ! ultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post . when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects . no , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing . eventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier . i won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime . i will just mention one final flaw . brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia . the rape occurred in west point , which is in new york . he is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case . he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point . does he phone the doctor ? no , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline . you have been warned , stay away from this one . 
" virus " is a monster movie without a monster . any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise . sadly , " virus " does not deliver , on any level . the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it . sudddenly , a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space , and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat . cut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures . see , they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead-in-the-water ships to rescue , and then collect the reward money . at least , i * think * that's what they do . along with many other things in the film , their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn't really explained . so , they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it , and decide to haul it back to russian waters . the only problem is , the crew starts disappearing one-by-one and turning into borg . yes , borg . complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye . apparently , this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical . so , it creates make-shift machines and uses humans for " spare parts " . blah , blah , blah . i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't . suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! ) . everything else in this movie has been taken from other ( better ) movies . for example , many of the machines resemble those found in the little-seen japanese movie , " tetsuo-the iron man " . and the plot is right out of " aliens " . the funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie . i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies , like last years under-appreciated " deep rising " . but " virus " , as i mentioned earlier , doesn't even have a monster . it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption . " virus " is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it . besides the lame " monster " , it's chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say , and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into . for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life . finally , " virus " isn't scary . the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary . as it is , it's about as frightening as a box of cookies . skip " virus " . if it's a cool monster movie you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddy of this genre ) " aliens " . 
joe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory . the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it . it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles . but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . . if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano , it is that the plot is original . unfortunately , it is also incredibly stupid . the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work . this opening sequence is very boring and slow . it shows joe walking to his office . but on the way , he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting . a sequence like this should take 2 minutes . here , it takes over 5 . . . it is obvious that joe hates his job . at his office , one of his co-workers is meg ryan . oddly enough , she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! ! joe leaves to go to a doctor's appointment . his doctor informs him that he has a " brain cloud . " this means that in a few months , he will die . so what does joe do ? quit his job , of course ! ! when he arrives home , joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges ) . graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island , the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god . by a startling coincidence , the boat trip to the island takes a few months . by the time he reaches the island , he will almost be dead from the " brain cloud " anyway , so joe agrees . graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this " great adventure " . joe goes on a date with meg ryan , his co-worker . the day before the boat trip , joe meets one of graynamore's daughters . she is also , surprise , meg ryan . except she looks more hippyish . they both have dinner and the next day , joe gets driven over to his boat . the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamore's daughters . and , wonder of wonders , she is also played by meg ryan . as they sail to the island , meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda . after some stupid talking scenes , they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to . and that the " brain cloud " thing was made up ! ! they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage . joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark . this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times . but , to top it off , the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! ! one night there is a storm . a cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard . fortunately , joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail . by pure luck , they get to the island . since the natives like orange soda , they wear soda cans as attire ! ! stupid or what ? ; ) before joe leaps in the volcano , he gets fed . right before he jumps , meg ryan pleads him not to . when joe decides to , she goes in with him because " she loves him " . now this is where the movie should end . but , unfortunately , the " cheesy ending " bug comes in . the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joe's luggage . they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers . i give this movie a . see it only if you're a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan . . . 
brian de palma's snake eyes stars nicolas cage's evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother . like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . de palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic . in snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast . only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material . the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller . ryuichi sakamoto's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene . heavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder . ( the script by de palma and lost world's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . only the latter is achieved . ) cage plays rick santoro , a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money . the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held . with a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn't know when to shut up . spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , " i was made for the sewer , baby ! " actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole . sinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight . but most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . the plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers . the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not . although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . the movie's outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden . the film takes itself all too seriously . at best , it is a 1940s-style b movie . a little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better . and , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement . snake eyes runs 1 : 39 . it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
by phil curtolo " madonna - antonio banderas - jonathan price - in an alan parker film - with music from andrew lloyd weber - and lyrics by tim rice - evita . " now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock-opera-turned-major motion picture is almost breath-taking for some . the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to . so why wouldn't the movie be wonderful to see . simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane . the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) , evita is full of drama that's trapped inside by all the notes and chords . she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker , then goes into the field of acting , and finally meets juan peron ( price ) , the soon-to-be first president of argentina . they fall in love and eventually marry . sounds pretty good , doesn't it . well the story gets better , as eva goes on the " rainbow tour " across europe , trying to win respect . eva duarte was a wonderful lady . however , all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood . i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right . they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar . although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye-catching , as was madonna's performance . as the " spiritual leader of argentina , " madonna would have definitely been an oscar-contender had she spoken a single line . but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film . don't get me wrong and don't look at my grade . i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen . if you're going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie . now i have to admit , it's a lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play , but that's what did me in . all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie . now you may be saying , " what kind of critic is he ? , " and you're right . as a critic , i should have given the movie a chance . but as a 17-year old quentin tarantino fan , it was way too hard . , 
die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs . so much for the script . how about the action ? well , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . by contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good . you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff . 
the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing . jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican . his and his men's mission is to clean the earth from vampires . they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them . valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself . for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross . with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight . after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . . i have never liked john carpenter and his style . after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed . john carpenter remains john carpenter . however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time . neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original . but there are some things that are interesting . the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance . at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life . otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy . carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere . set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness . more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil . the cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement . music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice . when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing . he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the " breed of evil " . woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance . daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner . the other cast members are struggling . because the film doesn't take itself too seriously , it stays afloat . still it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience . 
way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad . one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance . after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his " target " . it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate . but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty . here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his " look here , see " glory . it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion . unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that . as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man . the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed . but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit . directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity . unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it . the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously " dramatic " . usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled . however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . or substance . it's just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . even the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like " karma is only justice with out the satisfaction " are clever . at one point caan laments " need is the ultimate monkey " a line so inexplicable he might as well have said " love is like hippo ass " . i've seen porno with better dialogue . and some with better plot lines too . but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . caan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . benicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . speaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he's only kept around for his cold presence . taye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . it's vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about " faggots " migrating to los angeles . you know the routine . the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . but those gun shots sure crack like thunder . just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry's fetishized smith and wesson . oh how far we've come . 
upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases " been there " and " done that " come quickly to mind . spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series . stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff . what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka . agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith . along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act . the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical . spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films . the " dick , the world is in danger . what is it ? well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . . ( i'm paraphrasing ) " type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny . what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue . director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short . the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax . as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context . one of the more amusing was , " captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james t . kirk " . overall , i thought this was a very weak effort . while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods . next time they should " spy " a little bit harder . * * * * = excellent . one of a kind . must see . * * * = entertaining . worth the price of admission . * * = fair . nothing much special . * = what were they thinking ? ? 
there have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than " the mod squad , " a self-consciously " hip " cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers . well , said " squad " certainly won't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else , maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards . a contemporary take on this decidedly '70s show doesn't exactly seem unwarranted , but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn't transform into a full-blown case of botulism . how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad , insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time . they are julie , pete and linc , reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that you're likely to be lost from the opening moments on ) , and they are respectively played by claire danes , giovanni ribisi and omar epps , talented actors each deserving of better than this . their plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff , as our would-be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina , one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking . they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others . when you're supposed to be asking , " what's going to happen next ? " , you'll instead entertain thoughts like " who are these people and why should i care ? " or " aren't thrillers supposed to contain thrills ? " not that danes , epps and ribisi don't give it a shot . danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep , as evidenced by " my so-called life , " but she's saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend ( josh brolin ) subplot so see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence . ditto for ribisi's ( " saving private ryan " ) looney loose cannon , though at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention . but epps - poor epps . epps ( " higher learning " ) is so short-changed he's reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him . all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters , one of whom , scott silver , is also the director . they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings ( the look of the film is really quite impressive ) , it'll somehow pay off , but this " mod squad " plods anyway . characters are non-existent ; present are just some good-looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes . plot hardly escapes confusing convention . and the one genre element you'd think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions , some fights , any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest . all those quick to put down last month's inept but serviceable " my favorite martian " update need to take a step back . here's a small-to-big-screen translation that really should've stayed in its former incarnation , " mod " or not . 
in " the astronaut's wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly . if only her name wasn't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary's species . " what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in " the devil's advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory . ok , maybe " the astronaut's wife " deviates from " rosemary's baby " turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man . predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . " theron's " advocate " character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly . " astronaut " provides only artificial anxiety . last year's equally noodle-headed " species ii " spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage . " the astronaut's wife " is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that isn't even going to satisfy those who've stayed with it thus far . here's a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from " the abyss " and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler's co-star in " big daddy . " draw your own conclusions . director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary " e . t . " cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying to tell . this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( " speed " 's joe morton ) to instigate jill's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth . his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge . instead , he adds to the phoniness . theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation " cider house rules , " he in the lead of tim burton's eagerly-awaited " sleepy hollow . " undeserving of such talent , " the astronaut's wife " manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs . in space , no one can hear you scream . but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore . 
" in dreams " might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . " he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish , it's this one . don't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . annette bening , another asset " in dreams " shouldn't be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return . she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . this being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , " in dreams " trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . subplots appear and disappear . when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . " in dreams " reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . some questions , then : what's with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? what about the computer ? does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? is the woman in australia integral to anything ? and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? sigh . at least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste . 
synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn't look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court . after a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie . comments : " alan smithee " directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled " fatal bore " or " fatal crap " . if you find out that a film you're about to see is directed by " alan smithee , " then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else . " alan smithee " is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad . frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the " alan smithee " moniker for this film . where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? let's start with the acting . it's pretty bad . amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material . she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete . her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke . the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand . christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm . trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here . early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an " erotic thriller " . a thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic . i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something " erotic , " that he'd be happy after watching this fluff . a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative ) . on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through . it's no wonder why she hated high school so much . as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration . i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . fatal charm won't charm anyone , unless there's someone that's charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers . if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on . 
despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances . so , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is . it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i'm not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) . the alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs's short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) . this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film's sil , but it's close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find . meanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes . it doesn't take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive . it's up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does . " this isn't the x-files , goddammit ! " exclaims one character in the early going . in terms of quality , he's absolutely right , but he's also wrong . the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected . looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's " black cancer " to me . but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . species was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did . human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? aliens sans flamethrowers . the visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . after the effects , the original's best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . however , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . at one point she's called on to play alien " empath " ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell . by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . one problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . the rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . helgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . williamson suffers the worst indignity . he tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as " i'm gonna get african on someone's ass " and not appear ridiculous ? but species ii's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . at least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger's character performing fellatio on madsen's , for a start . but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . for all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . 
a big , busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch , the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to " invent " a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " ( damon wayans ) . ( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . ) he may be right , in an absurdly accurate way , but the film doesn't give us a reason to care . as a scathing sports spoof , hype is just that : unfunny , unfocused , and , at times , just plain pointless . as a commentary on race relations , it's even * less * effective . the dialogue is the best of this mess , lines like jon lovitz exclaiming " i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs ! " writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang , though we never hear enough of it . the script isn't strong enough , though , to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin ( house party ) . he comes across as absolute overkill . the great white hype * almost * turns around at the end , at the big match , when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock-concert proportions . with costumed dwarfs , gangsta rappers , and the " champ " dressed as death , only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should've been . 
when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the '60s cartoon series of " mr . magoo , " special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay . mr . magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . in fact , they were wrong . mr . magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . magoo . the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . the worst , mr . magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . the first problem with mr . magoo is the script . despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . magoo is comically barren . from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found . every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that's not the case . i've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . then there's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . magoo . even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but " top form " is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation . the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . matt keeslar portrays one of magoo's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . the bumbling man's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . most of mr . magoo's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . the cartoon violence level in this film doesn't approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . there's a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean's recent , similar misadventure , it doesn't hold up well . then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . i'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . his chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . the screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn't seem to be enjoying themselves . when the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . mr . magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen . 
star wars : ? episode i -- the phantom menace ( 1999 ) director : george lucas cast : liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman , jake lloyd , ian mcdiarmid , samuel l . jackson , oliver ford davies , terence stamp , pernilla august , frank oz , ahmed best , kenny baker , anthony daniels screenplay : george lucas producers : rick mccallum runtime : 131 min . us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements copyright 1999 nathaniel r . atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review . i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case . the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them . the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people . for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well ) . i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it . on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies . when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited . when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation . and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film . but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture . in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it . i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell . i just wanted to see the movie . reader , do not misunderstand . i did not have an anti-hype reaction . the hype was unavoidable . i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released . five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem . " who are these jedi knights ? " i asked . " why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? " " why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? " " why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? " these were just some of my questions early on . later , i asked , " where's the magic of the first three films ? " and " why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . the phantom menace is no star wars film . take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . it's an embarrassment . i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used . there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts . the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . this is not what i wanted to see . i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . first of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . not one thing . what was his life like before this film ? well , i imagine he didn't have one . that's why he feels like a plot device . this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly ) . obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i've ever had to endure , but he's more interesting than most of the humans . as soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it's back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . i've seen many movies that qualify as " special effects extravaganzas , " but the phantom menace is the first one i've seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . i can't say that i didn't find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . can't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . and then there's the question of magic . what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . john williams' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas' direction . i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . i longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . and what about the ridiculous expectations ? mine weren't that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . i don't hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exists , and yet i can't . it's here to stay . i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don't , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . 
synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas . arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand . comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series " party of five . " i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube . " party of five , " i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre . neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show . so too is jennifer love hewitt . lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line . though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout . jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting . she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either ) . this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure . add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience . i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason . i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses . nothing else here is original or interesting . this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art . i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc . you get the picture . the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook . they may as well have huge targets painted on them . like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief . unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny . in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough . the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film . several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie . this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for . and what is the deal with the slasher himself ? i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something . so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . . . titillating . this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part . oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive ! people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . boring ! i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . it's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don't seem to mind participating in a mass " mystery science theater 3000 " -type viewing . i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . if it weren't for the main actresses' revealing wardrobes , i'd have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . i can't imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn't recommend it to people , unless they're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . what a depressing thought . hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted . i'd say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn't have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film's target audience . 
bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures . mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined . and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale . art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent . you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist . enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant . he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says . naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government . lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest " unbreakable " code , mercury . however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code . naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l . ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard . and that's where art jeffries comes in . for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy . in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall . the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous . why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i mean , who would know ? it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher . and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? he's already proven that mercury can be broken . there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here . for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) . the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then mr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly . miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance . however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) . instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! ) willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type . rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess . and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) . as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay . this film wasn't well thought out at all . the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible . the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member . at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood . the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) . but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile . mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer . 
actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . " baywatch " babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen . at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage . and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire . you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not . a nipple hallucination sort of thing . barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions . yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one . she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience . you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills . i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention . the movie is set in the year 2017 , " the worst year of my life , " pam says . ( " the worst movie of the year , " i say . ) america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) . she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute . but don't call her " babe . " she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times . imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term . a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like " babe " during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success . the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners . in the words of one of the characters , they're " more than meets the eye . " reminds me of the " transformers " cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened . no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) . thank god they didn't name her cora reef . one bad character name is more than enough . pamela originally doesn't take sides , giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi " always " video fame . i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy ) . pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest . it's not rambo . . . it's bimbo ! mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year . it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin , the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free . it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo . there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen . someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars . if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements . barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death . this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct . barb wire has only two things going for it . . . and i think you know what those two things are . 
" the beach " is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of " blue lagoon " . forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of " lord of the flies " where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . the main character of " the beach " is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time . richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's . once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise . this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard . etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . for example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . there are several ideas that are introduced in " the beach " and each one could merit its own feature-length film . there's the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle . but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up . 
what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie . the garbage known as " snuff " films ? nothing , right ? what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ? well . . . nothing . so , why make it , hollywood ? there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic . no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this . the lack of quality filmmaking in " 8mm " ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable . but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! ) between . basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it . why not walk out ? well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie . here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of " 8mm " . . . first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud . it's not easy to watch . i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now . the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator . a rich old woman discovers a " snuff " film in her late husband's safe . she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead . she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find . family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque " murder " . let me backtrack for a moment . see , " snuff " films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead . however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and " good " acting make all the difference . very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies . the thought of this " industry " makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on . welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry . you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze . after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , " snuff " films . skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . . led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer " machine " ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue . the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante . this film doesn't draw you in . it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . " se7en " ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the " batman " franchise , but " a time to kill " was an immensely overrated disappointment . for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , " se7en " . director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . however , gratuitous is joel's middle name . he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . he doesn't leave much to the imagination . it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) craft . case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . see . . . no subtlety . does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? who do we root for in this mess ? is there anybody out there ? it's not all the director's fault , though . why did the actors sign up for this ? nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud ! if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? he was so solid as a concerned father in " a civil action " . i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or they're suckers . or they just don't care . there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . baby cindy is obviously cute and wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet . the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like " payback " ( which was a much better movie ) . the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it's rough . during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't good and whose timing was a half-second off . such a technical error indeed stands out . speaking of standing out , don't believe the misleading trailers . there's not much action here . occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . after seeing " 8mm " , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again . is that a positive ? well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they've done a swell job here . it'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . but today i'm not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? i'm sure that somewhere right now there's some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn't mean i need to know about it . yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there . yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn't look like we expect him to . you said all that in 1995 . move on . this film serves no purpose . it doesn't entertain , it doesn't teach us anything , it doesn't make a statement beyond the obvious " this stuff is bad " approach . only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile . that's not likely to happen , though , so " 8mm " is indeed a scummy waste of money . orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , " to movies . . . to good movies " . if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . like " snuff " films , " 8mm " should never have been made . now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . useless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme . he used it in " batman forever " , in " batman & robin " , in " a time to kill " , in " falling down " , and it's rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . . 
for " original sin , " the road to the screen has been rocky . initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . so is " original sin " really all that bad ? yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the " t " and antonio banderas the " a " ) . more importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . veteran readers know that , as a rule , i don't encourage people to patronize lousy films . most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the " let's go laugh at the failings of others " mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . but things are different this summer . quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i'm concerned , it's fair to find our kicks where we may . " original sin " will never join such treasures as " valley of the dolls , " " road house " and " showgirls " in the bad movie hall of fame , but it'll do until something worse comes along . the film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , " waltz into darkness " ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , " mississippi mermaid " ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie's character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , " this is not a love story , it is a story about love . " wary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . a practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . imagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . julia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face . luis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , " we have something in common , we are both not to trusted . " after their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers' insistence on using one of banderas' legs to cover jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her . luis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . luis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication . shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . finally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . incidentally , if you're afraid i'm giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . along the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie " 61 * " ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real julia . luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can't have her , he will kill her . oh , the pathos of it all . the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . banderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . as for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . his most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene . and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them " original sin . " 
one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . made in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , " warped , twisted masterpiece " of lynch clan . kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh's stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn't got anything in common with the works of director's more talented father . despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . the actors aren't good either . julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn't suit him . bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena's boyfriend . sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn't help this film . the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer's diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh's " regular " girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . the twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . all in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger's career . 
capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . . and nobody wins . the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting . christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan . he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die . let's stop and think about this for a second . if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems . lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them . lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional . the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany . there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot . by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way . this movie bungles two out of three , badly . 
america loves convenience . after all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed " the commander , " " the rookies , " and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to " me and my brother when we was kids . " apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle . explosions are fun . and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? " for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . 
this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . ray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement . ray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business . his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) . the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . desperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a " sure thing " at freehold raceway . the horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough . there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . so when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do . as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . his buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid . and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together . there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . 
steve martin is one of the funniest men alive . if you can take that as a true statement , then your disappointment at this film will equal mine . martin can be hilarious , creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters . you won't find any of them here . the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit . bilko ( and the name isn't an accident ) is the head of an army motor pool group , but his passion is his schemes . every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair-brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base . " mchale's navy " 's granddaddy . that's the idea behind this movie too , but the difference is that , as far-fetched and usually goofy as the television series was , it was funny . there is not one laugh in the film . the re-make retains the goofiness , but not the entertainment . everything is just too clean . it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it . it all looks brand new , even the old beat-up stuff . martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role . in the original , phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness . martin's bilko is a pale imitation . the only semi-bright spot is phil hartman as bilko's arch-enemy . it's not saying much , considering martin's lackluster character , but hartman leaves him in the dust . 
five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake . the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) . hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # 1521 ) . two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here . orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) . yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too . i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all ! the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability . thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film . the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks . any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line . the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens . there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office . i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . the script for this film is completely pathetic . the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . here is an example of the wonderful dialog . the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . " this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy . now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented . one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . " i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get . now lets talk about the great special effects for this film . this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers . the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence . a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie . are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ? the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film . in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing . very impressive trick ! the one ( half ? ) plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious . the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film . however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny . in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down . i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least . oh well , win some , lose some . 
okay , okay . maybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others . howewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash . boy , was i wrong ! in the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes . by the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers . not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense . of course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest . in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie . oh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other . i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie . often , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing . how many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ? too many . i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . . simply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience . my recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch . you'll be looking at it for most of the movie . my . rent die hard . read a book . stare at the sky . do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid . the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly . they probably like wrestling too : - ) . 
by-the-numbers : a film which introduces characters , situations , dilemmas and developments that we've seen before in a parade of other films . a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one . a film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience . in short , a clich ? -ridden formula film . welcome to my review of the general's daughter . plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter's rape , torture and murder . they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder . critique : by the numbers ( see above ) . this film is just there . it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again . it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away . it's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree . it's as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament . get the picture ? i sure did . . . it's too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed . easy as pie . it's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted . ) woods chews it up in the few scenes that he's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems ) . and this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen . it's like riding a bike . other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually " breaking down " to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the " best poor man's michael bay doing his best poor man's impression of tony scott " ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you're a great director . yawn . yeah , whatever tony . . . i mean , simon . ) and aren't we all sick of hearing about these army " bad boys " and their overdone " code of silence " ? ! enough already ! next subject , please . see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . otherwise , save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead . you'll feel much better afterwards . trust me . little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman , which eventually went to little dickie gere . ironically on james woods' part , he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv's " welcome back , kotter " , starring none other than john travolta . actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his " big dick " on howard stern's radio program . unlike rocker tommy lee , woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 . he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section . what a man ! john travolta is married to actress kelly preston , and they have a son named jett ( travolta loves them planes ! ) . word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis' home . director simon west's first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6 . 5/10 ) . before that , he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants . yippee ! veteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 ) , the manchurian candidate ) portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film . the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5 , 1968 , it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day . clarence williams iii , who plays colonel fowler in this film , is known to some from his role as " linc " in the original " mod squad " tv series . younger folk may remember him as prince's father in purple rain . 
i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . take the professional , for example . it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . 
" tarzan and the lost city " is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like " heaven's gate " ( 1980 ) or " ishtar " ( 1987 ) were bad . instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's " greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes " ) down to the really bad ( 1981's " tarzan , the ape man " with bo derek ) . most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . " greystoke " added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even " tarzan , the ape man " at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts . " tarzan and the lost city , " on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . the script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . comic books have better plots than this . the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy " george of the jungle . " didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from " raiders of the lost ark " ( 1981 ) to " the goonies " ( 1985 ) . when the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . of course , one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . there is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? strictly speaking , " tarzan and the lost city " isn't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien's laughably stiff performance comes real close . this movie proves what " starship troopers " only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . waddington makes a decent villain , although he's like a charmless version of belloq from " raiders of the lost ark . " as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . however , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . " tarzan and the lost city " is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . so , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . 
tri-star ; rated r ( language , sexual situations , violence ) ; 87 minutes director and writer : darren stein cast : rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , judy greer , julie benz , chad christ , ethan erickson , carol kane , pam grier , tatyana m . ali . review by : geoff berkshire jawbreaker is the very definition of a " rip-off . " this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s . along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her " foxy " , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind . liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body ) . courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into " vylette " , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . up until about this point the film is effective enough . however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull . the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . fern's rise to popularity is equally lame . we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense . stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve's bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like " auto stud , " " college stud , " and " high school stud #2 . " the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen's catchy " yoo hoo " makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film . 
the kids in the hall are an acquired taste . it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . a big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show . the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so . and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . in typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit . but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough . strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . in the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . the kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task . there are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one . 
" deep rising " gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's " anaconda " -- " deep rising " has no tongue to put in its cheek . folks , we're only a month into the new year , and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen " titanic , " then maybe they'd have known to stay home ) when it's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . the main problem with " deep rising " is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . the concept is " leviathan " meets " titanic , " with a dash of " speed 2 " thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) measure . this monster is equal parts " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " and " the relic , " knows how to open doors like the raptors from " jurassic park " and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in " anaconda . " some of the attack sequences are straight out of " jaws " and " alien . " a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of " alien resurrection . " there's even a jet ski chase like " hard rain . " and the list goes on . watching " deep rising " 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . williams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn't believable . an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as " goldeneye " 's killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o'connor , as finnegan's mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . djimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december's " amistad , " pops up in a brief part . he needs to stay away from the water . the movie's final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . as if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn't bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you're really asking for it ) , " deep rising " is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the question . 
you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . while watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film . it's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial . through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . gooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and " suggested by " a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work ) . nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . first , we have the prison warden subplot . the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that's fine . there's also the prison guard subplot . the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . then there's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had . ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption . hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . and then there's the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are " takers , " that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . i can sympathize with that , but only when it's in a compelling film . this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors . 
deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 capsule review : this is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90's : an hour-and-a-half commercial , disguised as an unnecessary remake , in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass . ( between this , rocketman , and george of the jungle , disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film . ) as the absent-minded professor who invents the titular computer-generated goop , a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly . the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly-founded but firm belief that writer/producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he's used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series . take your kids to see boogie nights instead . 
the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . the " hook " that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . however , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . i don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . once again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . soon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . along the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? apparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called " mercury . " to make sure it can't be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a " nerds' puzzle magazine . " of course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . when he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . as a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . but he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . it's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren't that pulse-pounding . the climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . overall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn't derivative or obligatory . bruce willis' star seems to be fading . this is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . willis isn't terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . alec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . the film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . for those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . hopefully , the advent of summer will change that . until then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . and , if you're determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may . 
director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama " when a man loves a woman , " but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , " message in a bottle , " which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , " meaningful " statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . " message in a bottle " begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner . she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier . do you think you know where this is headed ? most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second . if there are any positive things to say about " message in a bottle , " it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , " shaggy dog " love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently . it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea . the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the " friend " roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune . the first half of " message in a bottle " plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time " getting to know " garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining . usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt " written , " and not as if people were really " talking . " when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble . i swear that while watching " message in a bottle , " i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , " city of angels . " although theresa is deeply touched by the " heartfelt " letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began . it should have read , " memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! " 
in my review of " the spy who shagged me , " i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . " scream 3 " provides the latest proof of this rule . in los angeles production has begun on " stab 3 : return to woodsboro , " the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . however , life soon starts imitating art , and " stab " cast members turn up stabbed . smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in " stab 3 . " elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . . . until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice . the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . indeed , " scream 3 " tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original " scream . " at the scene of each murder in " scream 3 , " the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is ) . unlike its predecessors , " scream 3 " doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is . the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? the driven young director ( scott foley ) ? the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random . wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen . the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious . possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche . i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first " scream " was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home . at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas . " scream 3 " also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles . look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from " seinfeld " ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point . all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- " scream " job search . another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying " the blair witch project " 's web strategy . " scream 3 " has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie . the sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the " latest 'stab 3' news . " there's also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more " stab " scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) . craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the " scream " series . while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters . there's a " halloween h2k " in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in " h20 , " and a " freddy vs . jason " has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were " killed off . " there's bound to be a " scream 4 " someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes . bottom line : they should have called this one " yawn . " 
there's only one presidential election every four years , but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year . in 1997 , we've had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 . this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys . here's what happens this time . it's night at the white house . a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt . the next day she's dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in . how do we know he's a hotshot ? we've seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene . it's not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street . snipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won't cooperate with him at all . in fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn't have been allowed in the white house at all . alda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . . a very dangerous liaison . well , not really , i just wanted to say that . almost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos . snipes doesn't buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president's son . snipes' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn't believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information . for the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting . sure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . snipes and lane don't make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they're just cogs in the bad movie machine . dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that's saying a lot . when you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you'll wish you never sat through this movie at all . the " 1600 " in the movie's title doesn't represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide . serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century ! 
" there will be another , " the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway . the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . of course , it doesn't . stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating . city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success . in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . perez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . at first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . like all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination . in the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't distinctly secondhand . even the soundtrack is tired . more than anything i've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look . critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn't that bad per se . he's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . his major stylistic failing is that he can't seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't , the performers who couldn't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . who bought david s . goyer's anemic script , anyway ? the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference . 
susan granger's review of " america's sweethearts " ( columbia/sony ) what a waste of a talented cast ! billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected . ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . but the laughs are few and far-between . crystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma . zeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional . only hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . basically , we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " america's sweethearts " is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it's strictly superficial . 
eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights . as the movie's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails . but at the same time , he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds . should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy . here's what murphy thinks : " i think the audience is expecting a good time . they gonna get sexy . they gonna get funny . they gonna get drama . they gonna get all of that . i think it's the best movie i've done " ( paramount radio network ) . here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense ) . and guess who's to blame ? ! the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film . no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled . murphy's awful script is the culprit . let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture . yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw . practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word . and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating . ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes . each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it's another matter altogether . you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . and he shoots jasmine guy in the head . this is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn't have any scenes with murphy . thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer . ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date . the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film . murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality . sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting . if you're going to make another sting movie , you've got to do something original . murphy's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . ( 7 ) murphy's idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life . for what ? for shooting reese's little toe off ! needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter . in all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie . danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take . aiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) . aiello's zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice . another bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy . in fact , hall's ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie . unfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role . of course , i've already mentioned that i didn't care for murphy's character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . they are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission . 
a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were . on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( " the secret garden " ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . leonardo's rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud's poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . the film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . he accepts verlaine's praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine's busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family's money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . when verlaine states , " poets can learn from one another , " rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , " only if they're bad poets . " he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . verlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . when mathilde's father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . it's a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . the film ends on a whimper . . . with verlaine talking with rimbaud's sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . this film was especially annoying because rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn't work . it certainly didn't bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . 
steve martin shines but sgt . bilko fails to impress based on the popular 50's sitcom , sgt . bilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever . remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ? ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) . i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy , but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire , sad to say , with mixed success . such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following , the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie . sgt . bilko ( frankly , i have not seen any its original tv version ) , even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain . sgt . ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter . though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of , he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools . though materialistic in mind , bilko's methods has thoughtfully `enriched' the lives of the men of fort baxter , providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that . colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused' state , bilko has managed to hide his operation , though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it . bilko's state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn , a tough cookie on army regulations , to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project , a new weapon under development within the fort's grounds . to add to his problems , thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo' done on him by bilko during their younger army days . director jonathan lynn , who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt . bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter , but that is about it . there are really not enough laughter-packed-moments in sgt . bilko to fully entertain the average movie-goer . still , steve martin's sgt . bilko is played with finesse and full-force by the renowned comedian . without him , sgt . bilko would have just fell flat on its face . sgt . bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world . the current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a blessing in disguise , really ; at least it will force hollywood to re-think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity . unless you are a fan of the tv-series or love to watch steve martin in action , you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres . i'm sure there are better ones around . 
at the end of an action scene in " lara croft : tomb raider , " a wall collapses near the nubile warrior . with her face on the floor , she gazes into the rubble , then grins abruptly and says " oh , my car keys ! " i mention this scene because it was the only moment in the whole damned production that made me smile . based on an incredibly popular video game , " lara croft : tomb raider " is a lousy movie . the structure goes like this : poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , poorly-staged action sequence , boring exposition , etc . etc . , the end . basically , the film exists to showcase angelina jolie's puffy lips and enhanced tits . close-ups are framed oh-so-carefully to include her million dollar bazooms . running scenes highlight her bouncing breasts in vintage " baywatch " fashion . there's even include a shower scene that offers a brief side view of them . but the filmmakers are so inept they can't even flash the audience correctly . the one extended display of nudity is of - get ready for this - a guy . for no particular reason , a muscular supporting character strolls around naked for about 30 seconds , with each shot composed to barely cover his package , ? la " austin powers . " now , i enjoy a good looking male body as much as the next gay guy , but what the hell is beefcake doing in a t&a flick aimed at heterosexual males ? of course , what else should one expect in a film that does virtually nothing right ? " tomb raider " sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) . it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies . throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons . intended to be a rousing " indiana jones " style adventure , " tomb raider " lacks any sense of tension . the low point comes when lara is " threatened " by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi . easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun . if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors . " tomb raider " tells a story , sort of . once every 5 , 000 years , the planets align . a group of very bad men are out to find two halves of an object that , if reassembled just as the planets align , will give them control over time itself . lara's goal is to stop them and rescue her long-missing poppa ( jon voight , jolie's real life dad ) . none of this matters though , because stunning gaps in internal logic assure that the plot of " lara croft : tomb raider " is as lame as ever other aspect of the film ? except angelina jolie's lips and breasts . 
the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . " it wasn't me ! " he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either . fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth . as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void . . . fred . yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known . for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play . his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records . overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist . from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . you know , standard kid movie material . almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role . we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it . while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable . to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . why ? because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy . stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him . peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it's best . williams , on the other hand , can't garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory . as for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . this is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . giving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times . the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn't crack up over every little thing . then again , maybe they were asleep . some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren't the targeted audience and therefore aren't meant to , and won't , enjoy them . sadly , it's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it's presented right . a two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ? and saying that a parent's perspective isn't important is quite a poor theory to have when they're the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place . 
there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book " screenwriting made easy . " this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film . it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters . yes , " the poseidon adventure " is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters . and " earthquake , " my god ! " earthquake " has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold . " volcano " takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops . . . only it's in , dare i say it ? l . a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it . they're just stupid . and the actors are all good ones . tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer ) . anne heche is a good indy actress . don cheadle stole the disappointing " devil in a blue dress " from denzel's feet . and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors . but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on . they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film ) . there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone . i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! ) . and there are no interesting sites in l . a . that we see get destroyed . part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever . in " independence day , " the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens . that was cool . watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not . okay , so the film's not devoid of merit . as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best . and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool . john carrol lynch ( norm from " fargo " ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it . he has one guy who's wounded and could make it . he could throw the guy and jump and still survive . but no ! ! ! he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava . here's the cool sight : he melts . here's the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting . cool sight . no logic . but cool sight . the volcano erupts twice and for some reason , the film ends there . they aren't worried about it eruting again , they just go home to their toppled homes . but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn't go on . i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended . my god , it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film . i haven't seen " dante's peak " but i've heard it's a masterpiece compared to this . if you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting , rent " the towering inferno " with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervescent o . j . simpson ( he saves a cat ) . if you want to waste your time watching a boring , stupid disaster flick ( literally , it almost grossed half of its budget ) , see this . but i warned you . 
this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie . i * did * go into this one with high expectations . i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks . i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining . i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film . boy , was i wrong ! another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story ! the story , you ask ? well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk . he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic . lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks . when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling . they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard . the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in . they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house . turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage . she starts having some wild hallucinations . later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) . said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ . the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing . it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again . so , she helps him kill three businessmen . scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back . problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin . he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother . guess they couldn't get the original actor back . who knows . scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy . he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the " ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . " somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun . this guy is * so * bad ( " how bad * is * he ? " ) , * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear . for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby . anyway . hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams . the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed . she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons . at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing . the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake . the demons are not , however , the good guys . the dumb bimbo's the good guy . she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which . not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq . this is basically a " bad jinn " story . it is an * awful * movie . awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is . continuity ? who cares . acting ? * terrible * . script ? horrible . sounds canned . unrealistic . story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends . i do think the * rat * acting was quite good . i have never seen rats look afraid . they should get nominated for an award . really good acting there , the best in the movie . " the envelope for best furry rodent , please . . . " a " " rating would be far too generous . a " 1/10 " rating ( or -4 in the -4 to +4 rating system ) is far more accurate . this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing , chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog . i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show . people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen . had to have something to do . dumb , dumb , dumb movie . i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it . it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself . lots of slime and red-dyed corn syrup does not constitute " horror , " in my opinion . 
plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies . oh yeah , there's also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit , but trust me , you won't care much about the " plot " in this film . . . critique : parody movies either work or they don't and this one just doesn't work ! the laughs aren't as pronounced this time around , the energy level , the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here . it's like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something ( wink , wink ) . and the scariest part of it all ? check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy : seven ! i say again , it took seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes , half-assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror . now i'm not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed " funny sketch " ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves , but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on " saturday night live " . there are a couple of funny one-liners , but mostly just rehashed one-joke scenes , a lot of dead silence and lame gags . add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here ( the film's website isn't even up yet ! ! ! what the f * * * ? ! ? ) . i do however have to give it up to james woods , the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all ( the exorcist take-off-- miss this and you've missed any reason to see the flick ) . i especially liked his one-liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman's head turning . very funny ! unfortunately , the film plummets straight down after that , with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude , where's my car , and other action movies like charlie's angels and mission impossible 2 . now help me figure this one out , will you ? isn't this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies ? ! ? ( or maybe that's just the title of the film f-ing with my head ) . well , i'm sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame-ass script ! the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel . unfortunately for us , all we're left with here is a skeleton of a film which might've been funny , had it been worked over a few more times , tightened up here and there , and been injected with more solid laughs . but as things stand now , there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year's film has led everyone down this path , so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking , of course ) . you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough " real " effort into this chop-job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents . pooh on you ! ( that's telling 'em , joblo ! sheesh ) btw , i'm allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson , whose massive breasts and skanky g-string had me chompin' at the bit . you go , girl ! everyone else . . . stay ! where's joblo coming from ? airplane ( 10/10 ) - airplane ii ( 10/10 ) - galaxy quest ( 8/10 ) - hannibal ( 7/10 ) - the haunting ( 3/10 ) - mafia ( 5/10 ) - naked gun ( 8/10 ) - scary movie ( 8/10 ) - top secret ( 9/10 ) 
romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay . call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well . gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . jack has become addicted to " feeding the hole " , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can't remember seeing a character quite like her . after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . what a woman ! lena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife . there is little insight into her character . she's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . juliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it . both women were anything but sexy or attractive . poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene . fine . jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . fine . what does jack proceed to do ? he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . why ? the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite . i guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . or here's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . she proceeded to set the place on fire . wouldn't the flames burn off the fingerprints ? aren't dental records more important ? as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn't she come up with a better plot ? ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . ) lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . this film doesn't even add up the large details . there is little or no consistency in the story-line . not much makes sense . the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . so while it certainly isn't reservoir dogs , it certainly isn't diva . there's plenty more to tear apart in this film . my advice to someone who hasn't seen it to to wait until it comes on video . there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . it's not a boring film , just not a good one . or an intelligent one . 
" i would appreciate it if you didn't do that again . " starring jet li , bridget fonda , tch ? ky karyo , burt kwouk . directed by chris nahon . rated r . it's no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another . when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission , there is no problem with this , as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners . when they aren't , well , we're in bad shape . kiss of the dragon , jet li's second consecutive american misfire , plays like one big miscalculation , and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment . now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself . li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question . the problem isn't with him , it's with the movie's tone . the much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch . they're joyless , perfuctory ; li's rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton . but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side . the plot isn't relevant , but if you're curious , it's some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever . oh yeah , and li's character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle . " kiss of the dragon " is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately . there's a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain . this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor . there's no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it's only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot . kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film's flaws , was at least thoughtful . i don't know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic . i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day . if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them . the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy . no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks . 
if the 70's nostalgia didn't make you feel old , the 80's nostalgia is bound to . one of the latter set , " the wedding singer , " seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980's directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine . the wacky fashions are here . . . and the music . . . and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously-and too obviously-inserted for the didn't-we-dress-funny-back-then chuckle . the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings . both are engaged ; however , robbie's fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia's fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt-chasing speculator in junk bonds . robbie and julia go through the expected ups-and-downs as they realize they were meant to be together . i'll fess up-i've never found adam sandler funny . whatever his appeal is , i've missed it . ( other comedians i don't get include pauly shore and pee wee herman-make your own judgments ) . the stupidity and artificiality of the whole project is summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself . idol looks like hell , and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup . he's mocked by a photo of his younger self on a rolling stone cover in the same scene . we're not supposed to notice that , and we're not supposed to notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears to play fairy godmother to robbie . other cameos , by steve buscemi and jon lovitz , provide the only real laughs in the movie . lovitz is especially good , playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of robbie's post-break-up depression . 
darren ( jason biggs ) , wayne ( steve zahn ) , and j . d . ( jack black ) have been best friends since the fifth grade . like the three musketeers , they've been together through thick and thin . but , when darren meets an attractive , but cold-blooded and manipulative , psychiatrist , judith ( amanda peet ) , the long time friendship is placed in danger . it's up to wayne and j . d . to rescue their best friend in " saving silverman . " " silverman " has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren's soul . based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos . when wayne introduces darren to judith , he doesn't realize that he has opened a pandora's box of disaster for himself and j . d . judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match . since then , she has sought a new mate - someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision . enter darren silverman . once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement , wayne and j . d . try everything they can , including threats and bribery , to get judith to free darren . nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only , pretty sandy perkus ( amanda detmer ) . the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun . things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j . d . play cupid . the boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things . thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black . the pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior . they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task . steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the " brains " of the gang . jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence . the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material . the rest of the cast doesn't fare as well , though . jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( " american pie " and " loser " ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has . amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith . there is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind's image . she's a monster that wayne and j . d . must defeat to save their friend . unfortunately , there is no dimension to her character . amanda detmer brings nothing ( or gets nothing ) as darren's one and only . r . lee ermey , as the psychotic coach , made a bad decision taking this role . tune-meister neil diamond gives a good-natured cameo perf as the boys' idol and savior . production values are on par with the rest of the film - lackluster and non-involving . director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like " big daddy " and " beverly hills ninja , " but falls flat with " saving silverman . " the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a " good " film to sink our teeth into . at least , with " saving silverman , " we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black . too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor . kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy . i give it a c- . 
starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . so much for hopes . schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? well , it must have to the producers of junior . admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? anything would have been better than this mess . danny devito is wasted in this movie . his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) emma thompson is wasted here as well . while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . too bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here . am i being too hard on this film ? i don't think so . schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . they certainly managed here . maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents . 
various films seen at the seattle film festival : it's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned " docu-drama " of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play " rain " , based on w . somerset maugham's story " miss thompson " cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story " miss thompson " . this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for . still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light . nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . some gore . don't bring children to this one . don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . blech . . no fun whatsoever . meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany . of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . c -- $2 . 50 . the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : 1 ) be wary of french comedies . these people like jerry lewis . 2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . 3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty-lips " is probably not worth watching . 4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . lots and lots of horses . the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life . grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks . 
seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ? he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one ) . we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten . sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related . christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too . what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . it's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there's no rules about jumping too high . " " predictable " doesn't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . and it's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . i'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . it's safe to say everything that could be bad about " flubber " is . the only original element the film has is the world's first romance between a machine and a human . but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won't . 
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here . wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence . billy zane is wooden as the hero . kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie . only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance . she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of . oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won't even care . about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . this is not a good movie . 
you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they're as real as life . i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves . then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . these people had what are known as " conspiracy theories " - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . a little imagination goes a long way . in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him . he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional . he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation " conspiracy theory " newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help . one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . part of this is a result of the film's slow pace . it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite " black elements " : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . big deal , we've seen it all before . watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . now , when i say it took forever to set up the " relationship " between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . even gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . unfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through . for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine . this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . you know what happens then ? nothing , zip , nada . no follow-up whatsoever , so what's the significance ? okay , here's another one . a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel " the catcher in the rye " . jerry also has a bunch of copies . whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . the point becomes totally extraneous . oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . that's about it . for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he's nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . okay , here's my theory . this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . 
august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children's films , and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don't want to see slaughtered against family-oriented thanksgiving films . last year , the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon , and this year , they bestow max keeble's big move on delighted moviegoers across the country . parents will be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did . don't get me wrong - keeble , which is actually only a " ment " away from being a fetish film , isn't that entertaining . in fact , you'd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics ( monsters , inc . , harry potter ) come out next month . but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy , then you'd better do it ( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn't going to cut it ) . we first see young max keeble ( alex d . linz , home alone 3 ) as a pint-sized superhero , delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a david beckham cross , foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man ( jamie kennedy , jay and silent bob strike back ) and landing the neighborhood honey ( brooke anne smith ) , who , by the way , is the hottest chick in a disney film since emmanuelle chriqui played claire boner in snow day . the scenario is , of course , a dream . max is really a doofus and he wakes up on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude , no luck with the ladies and only two friends , both of whom can kindly be described as social outcasts ( and who were both in snow day ) - the perpetually robed robe ( josh peck ) and a clarinet-playing cutie named megan ( summer catch's zena grey ) , who harbors secret feelings for max . things don't get any better for max when he arrives at school . he has to contend with , among other things , a red-hot science teacher ( amber valletta , family man ) , a pair of polar-opposite bullies ( noel fisher and orlando brown ) , and an illiterate principal ( larry miller , the princess diaries ) who's secretly diverting the school's last dime into the football program . when max's father ( grownup nerd robert carradine ) unexpectedly announces the family is moving to a new town at the end of the week , max decides this is the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off . whoa - don't worry , parents . he doesn't do it klebold-harris style . it's all pretty tame stuff , but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move , leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings . director tim hill ( muppets from space ) adds a few nice touches , like max's voiceover character introductions for the film's main characters and a flashback scene that's pretty funny , but there isn't too much else happening here stylewise . . . unless you count some farting , a little puking , and a couple of bizarre cameos from tony hawk and lil' romeo . 1 : 30 - pg for some bullying and crude humor 
from dusk till dawn ( director/editor : robert rodriguez ; screenwriters : quentin tarantino/robert kurtzman ( story ) ; cinematographer : guillermo navarro ; cast : quentin tarantino ( richie gecko ) , george clooney ( seth gecko ) , juliette lewis ( kate fuller ) , harvey keitel ( jacob fuller ) , ernest liu ( scott fuller ) , salma hayek ( santanico pandemonium ) , tom savini ( sex machine ) , fred williamson ( frost ) , cheech marin ( border guard/chet pussy/carlos ) , michael parks ( texas ranger ) , brenda hillhouse ( hostage gloria ) ; runtime : 108 ; dimension films ; 1996 ) reviewed by dennis schwartz it's a love it or hate it film . i simply hated it . on its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner . it's a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed . a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b-films . it's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other . the plot involves two psychopath brothers , the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko ( clooney ) and the perverted psychopath killer , richie ( tarantino ) , who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist . they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town . they have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops , they have also taken a middle-aged bank teller as a hostage . in the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk , and burn down the store . stopping off in a flop-house motel , richie rapes and slaughters the hostage . these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody , if that's possible . on the tv news , it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers . the brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos ( cheech ) , who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take . with road blocks and car searches at the border , the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed . there is the father , jacob fuller ( keitel ) , who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident ; his sexy 20-year-old , innocent daughter , kate ( lewis ) ; and , her shy brother scott ( liu ) . it's not explained how he happens to be chinese . the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister . the place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film's title . here's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout . it sells sex to its patrons , and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium ( hayek ) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire . the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place , as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the film's staple . this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off , though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings . i'll take a pass on this one , it's just not my style of a film . the characters were as empty as the story , and the film was an easy one to forget . 
" saving silverman " is a good example of a good comedy gone bad . as a love story it is good , however as a comedy it falls flat on it's face . i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . . and those were just chuckles at the most ! the movie doesn't have the oomph to make it a great movie , and doesn't have the script to make it a funny movie . wayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) , j . d . mcnugent ( jack black ) , and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together , they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end . while in a bar after doing a show with their band , based on their love of neil diamond , darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for . wayne and j . d . however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again , it's up to wayne and j . d . to try and begin saving silverman . the performances are topnotch and surprisingly , they are what keep the movie afloat . jason biggs right off the flop " loser " does an ok job playing silverman , but he is stale and flat at times . steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier , and even though the movie is about silverman , lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself . jack black is well jack black , and he does an all right job as j . d . but he isn't as funny as he has been in the past . amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith , and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( he's better at singing than acting ) . anyway the performances in the film are good , but it's too bad the script isn't . speaking of script , hank nelkan's choppy script is not only badly written , but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street . the trailer for the movie , as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie , especially the funniest parts . somewhere " saving silverman " was meant to be a good movie , and it could have been , but alas in the end it wasn't . dennis dugan's direction is all right , he adds a few directorial touches here and there , nothing special being a simple comedy . " saving silverman " is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one . it has a great cast , a good director and a sweet story . . . it's just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie . 
according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors " hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . " hmm . you never know , they just might be on to something . what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . it's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . that's a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy's hand . then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that's . . . dumb and dumber . yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . now , don't get me wrong , there's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . the trouble is that these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . it lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . some gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don't do anything . why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? why two of these ? why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? the film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , " wouldn't that be funny ? " . well , no , actually . the actors don't do the movie much favours either . woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please ) . even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie's climax . all in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . we'll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( " strictly bowling " , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy . the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . 
everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) . but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure . i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co . as i've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it's time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director . ( while we're at it , put that visor back on laforge ! ) for three hundred years , the ba'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth . six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly . but evil ru'afo ( this is probably abraham's last stop before performing " amadeus " at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed . the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race . ( never mind that the ba'ku didn't exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . ) every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment . he has called it a comedy , a thinking man's picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western . ( i presume that's some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . ) he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version . that's no excuse-someone generated this footage . muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia . consider such curiosities . . . picard's love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ? " don't ask . " worf gets a pimple ( he's re-experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton's real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android's butt . most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ? the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru'afo into a completely power-mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax . ( and if you've seen return of the jedi , you've seen the ending of this movie . ) didn't picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ? frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists . ( take a look at the painful " troi gets drunk " scene in fc and you'll get the general idea of insurrection's unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . ) even the worst shatner and co . treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones . neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge . and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise's answer to urkel . need a cheap laugh ? have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it's the hunk of styrofoam it really is . here's my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data . in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation . star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film . i'm not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again . 
sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ? yup , it's gotta be summer . just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed . the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff . sound exciting ? dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing . ( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro- magnetic fields , no less ! calling dean edell . . . ) so , he overrides the boat's computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn't evacuate in time , on a col- lision course with destiny . ( oddly , no one thinks to just . . . jump off the back of the boat . ) with keanu reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the script ? -- the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated . ( what are the odds ? ) they're on this caribbean cruise for pleasure , as are a handful of requisite stock characters , including a deaf teenager ( ! ) who has a crush on the hero ( ! ! ) who also knows how to sign ( ! ! ! ) . ( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ? wait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! ) bullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests . ( those paying attention to her bikini- and tank- tops probably won't complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that's damn good , 'cause when he stops to talk , he's only slightly less monotone than his predecessor . ( his first lol line is to ms . bullock : " i'd like to boogie with you . " ) of course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does . he also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards . ( con air , buddy , father's day , romy and michelle's high school reunion , murder at 1600 , 8 heads in a duffle bag , anaconda , vegas vacation , meet wally sparks , metro , bevery hills ninja , the relic , all is forgiven ) . worse , he's spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesn't even live up to its title ! there's no sweat-inducing motion of the ocean here-- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of cross-cut exteriors , all leading up to the big slam , when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town . ( oh , how far we've come in twenty years . remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak ? ) admittedly , either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission . it's just the rest of the movie-- the other hundred or so minutes-- that's pure nonsense . and wonderful nonsense at that . i know he didn't intend to , but de bont has done one thing right : he's created the hands-down funniest film of the year . so , now , allow to present a few more things that made me laugh : o a box with a big label : " fiber optic converter " o plain english , whole-sentence computer instructions o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door o jason patric's character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that's happening o a ships' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say " i canna override it ! " o willem dafoe's amazing arm-mounted keyboard o two living , breathing adults ( bullock's character and the first mate ) who have to be told , step by step , how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade . duh o " no wait ! " screams the ship's intercom o yet another damn dog in peril o fishing reel . pontoon plane . memories of weekend at bernie's 
i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad , there would be broken furniture , traces of smack and cocaine on the floor , and a dead prostitute in the bathroom . i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad , there might be the same elements present . coincidence ? poor kyle ( a meek looking jon favreau ) . . . he is about to marry his radiant fiancee , laura ( cameron diaz ) . but before he exchanges his vows , he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout . but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get . the prostitute has met a horrible , though accidental death , and drugs are everywhere . the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time . a surprisingly calm robert boyd ( christian slater ) , who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions , ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she'll never be found . although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body ( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases ) , when they return from their trip , guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends . one is adam ( daniel stern ) he grows increasingly agitated . whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way , his blood pressure increases . or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family . another is michael , who was actually responsible for her death . he tries to bury his feelings , but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well . boyd is the ? doer' of the group . seemingly suffering from a long psychosis , when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed , he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks . kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura's demanding expectations . then , there's moore ( leland orser ) who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face . the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy , but it presents things in a manner that just aren't funny . drugs , mutilation , and killing your own friends isn't something to be laughed at . as a straight psychological drama , i could see how it might have worked , as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick ways . but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours . if you do like this movie , i don't think that i want to know you . i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the ? smart play . ' and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding-needing fiancee . but her talents are essentially wasted here . it's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone . but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless . do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film . 
synopsis : in " sooner than you think " america , the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad , a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs . a dangerous criminal , however , attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them . comments : so , what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop , a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem , and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common ? why , they're all members of blade squad , an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms , rollerblades , and jetpacks ! they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron's aliens . yes , it's blade squad , the fox network's wednesday night movie of the week . this " movie , " marking its dubious world premiere today , curiously has a number of guest stars . " how can a movie have guest stars ? " you may ask . well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie . blade squad is dumb . blade squad is loud . blade squad is obnoxious . blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series . why not ? after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( " knight rider " ) , fast helicopters ( " airwolf " ) , and super fast motorcycles ( " street hawk " ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past . so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable . the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested . i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it . i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad . i can remember liking " airwolf " and " street hawk " when i was 10 or 11 . and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning ) . but , i digress . despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series . one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background . oh yeah , dylan's " knockin' on heaven's door " and bowie's " i'm afraid of americans " are used here , in rather poor taste . two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound . the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end . characters' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible . during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . when a character spoke , the song's volume dropped but did not disappear . as soon as that character finished speaking , the song's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke . this sounds trivial , i'm sure , but it distracted me immensely . finally , this is commercial television . foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television . thus , don't use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner . in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets . when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car's horn off-screen to muffle the word out . in a " seinfeld " episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably . perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics' 2099 series of comics . make up a bunch of new bad words for the future . this way , you don't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language . compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp . when compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs .

you'd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games . it hasn't worked so far . " street fighter ? " " super mario brothers ? " " wing commander ? " " mortal kombat ? " not a watchable film in the bunch . still i held out some hope for " tomb raider . " after all , the game's premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies , so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept . however , despite the potential of the project , " tomb raider " proves to be yet another bomb . the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies . there's a once-ever-5000-years alignment of planets coming up , and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world . of course , the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world . our heroine , lady lara croft ( angelina jolie ) , finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father ( jon voight ) dug up . she figures that if she gets the triangle , she can bring her dad back from the dead . of course , no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway . in both video games and action movies , the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences . however , the action in " tomb raider " shows little style or originality . there's lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin' , but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct-to-cable flick . the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer , " the mummy returns , " was much better ; it had its flaws , but its action was creative and large-scale . since winning her academy award for " girl , interrupted , " jolie hasn't taken any projects that would display her acting talents . " tomb raider " seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts ; so much attention is drawn to them that it's a shame there's no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra . while we don't see much of her acting ability ( with the exception of a wonderful upper-crust british accent ) , we do get a hint of jolie's less savory side . considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death , having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father ( and uninterested in any of the living males around her ) seems a poor choice . having jolie's real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier . i haven't decided what to make of director simon west yet . his first feature was the star-studded disaster " con air , " but my opinion of him improved with " the general's daughter , " which was thick with sultry atmosphere . now this train wreck . i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series " the prisoner . " hollywood has already screwed up " the avengers , " and " the prisoner " represents a chance for redemption . ( by the way , speaking of british tv , " red dwarf " fans should look for chris " rimmer " barrie in his first major film role ) . 
" some houses are born bad , " goes the haunting's tag line , to which i must add , " some movies , too . " nothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel . the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout " boo . " fragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . marrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history . he's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants . taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . for starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . her character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch . as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . unfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . theo's assessment of the house ? " i love it ! sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . " who on earth would say that in place of " citizen kane meets the munsters " ? ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland . as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old " academic bait and switch " on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused . later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout " nell " repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still . i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners . i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills . 
synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall . comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it . strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) . strike two came while the previews played . did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ? well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) . tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout . about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery . to be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller . wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title . james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten . brolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company . by the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious . apparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city . but , then again , what do i know about business ? i do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch . larson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill . this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it . the film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game . larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help . some old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film . the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two . outside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious . if you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't . make tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery . 
capsule : a wild jungle woman and an 11-story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc . this is a laughable 1977 rip off of king kong ( 1976 ) , itself a rip-off . production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter . , high -2 ( -4 to +4 ) - directed by ho meng-hua . - this film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the festival . - an earthquake uncovers an 11-story tall gorilla in the himalayas . a hunter , chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends , gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape . - evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of . - gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible . nice miniature effects , however . - has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi-chi the leopard . - several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim . - actual location shooting in mysore . ape shown badly matted behind temple . - combining of images usually pretty bad . incompetent matching of film stocks . - stock footage frequently used . - gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good . 
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised " featuring the music of . . . " no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . welcome to the club , scott kalvert . your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . dicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based . as the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . one night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin . jim's addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school . along with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower . the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll's posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends . as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long " just say no " public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out . perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those " good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd " that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . on only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective . mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been . for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story . he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting . at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents . far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . 
writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard . harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun . harder than building a bridge over troubled waters . and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review . thrillers are all variations on a theme . you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet . you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process . the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner . this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . . is anyone else getting depressed here ? point is , it's not enough to follow the formula . you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version . something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals . this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way . without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails . that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f . bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire . richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal . the jackal is trying to kill someone . gere is trying to stop him . will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count . ) there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , " i wonder what happens next ? " the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines . it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium . throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them . no surprise . the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy . instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script ) . and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight . it's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it . and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not . what's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids . as for the performances . . . bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie . his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint . richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance . sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it's not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) . writing a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done . it wasn't done here . it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones . do not go see this movie . you'll only encourage the producers to make more just like it . instead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud . anything other than the jackal , which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other , better movies . 
some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it . thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations . last year it was the thin red line . this year's " winner " is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool . acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun . and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story . it's about rubin " hurricane " carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! ) detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the " big-shot " hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? ) when rubin was only ten . he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole . most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison . to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives . lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education . lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- " the sixteenth round , " rubin's autobiography . immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra " sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us . " hmmm . after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him . they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings . of course , we're already told that he's innocent . a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life . all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version . that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it . it's almost cruel . the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity . witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists . the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie . it's formula stripped to the bare necessities . you have your wrongly accused black man . you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene . but there's nothing else . you'd expect some sort of involving investigation . but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence . thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding . brooding to himself . brooding to other inmates . brooding to lesra . brooding to lesra's canadian friends . brooding in letters . i don't think i'll ever look at brooding the same way again . it wasn't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition . i wanted something to happen . as for washington's performance in the title role -- i figured i'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's received -- he is top notch , though still boring . how is that possible ? well , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly . unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap . what a waste of a great performer . speaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ? he's an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ? to call his character ( along with schreiber's and unger's ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement . all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come . if they're to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ? look : if you're going to make a formula movie , don't undermine the formula . courtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous . not only is it trite , it's boring . 
i've heard it called " jaws with claws " and that's a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality . director stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century . they've stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music . the movie doesn't make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest . in fact , some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you've stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie . how about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then can't even hit the damned thing ? or the ham-on-wry acting of michael douglas , who chews more scenery than the animals ever do ? ? or , my favorite , lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops ? ! ? 
the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . in panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and " rambo " -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . he is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody's guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . so many questions are left unanswered , and i'm sure they won't be addressed in the inevitable sequel . while last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . spawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie . 
absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence . continually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need . details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) . oddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities . a masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g . marshall ) . while robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault . there , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay . their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman . in self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow . she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men . the man ? he is the president of the united states of america . where does the film go wrong ? it cannot be the acting . clint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances . the cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue . even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre . the fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone . while setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it . not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax . rather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness . an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant . police officers are everywhere , incognito of course . at the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives . all three parties are unaware of each others presence . this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position . he will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations . however , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away . the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes . ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap . the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . . parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . the daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere . of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family . again , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot . however , trying is simply not enough ! the second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . . everything this film is not . how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ? how could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ? i am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film . director quentin tarantino once said : " i can make a good movie out of any bad script . " director clint eastwood obviously cannot . 
after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . maybe not ! mindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . tango & cash has " lowest common denominator " written all over it . the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn't need the money . in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . tango & cash is unbearably noisy . for starters , there's harold faltermeyer's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . to make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . it's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman's script and thinking , " i want to be in this movie . " the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . they simply could have called it " action movie . " every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a " road runner " cartoon . action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism . the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming " lethal weaponesque " adventure . tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . machine guns and torture generally don't mix well with comedy . jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . his character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . like many movie villains , palance likes to play games . in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . you have to wonder why palance doesn't just shoot the detectives in the head ! the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . teri hatcher plays stallone's sister and russell's love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . but regrettably , hatcher's acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . there's really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . and , more to the point , tango definitely isn't worth a penny of your cash--so don't bother . 
plot : two sister witches have to live with a curse placed upon their family , which prevents them from ever enjoying a full life with a lover . the hex invokes the eventual demise of their loved one . when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them , they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma . critique : i've been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now , but hold on to your brooms and incantations , cause this puppy is far from being it ! for a film that has the word " magic " in its title , this movie contains very few moments of magic . . . or humor for that matter , drama , suspense , or romance . well actually , there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled , it never lets you in on whether it's a comedy , a drama , a horror show , or a murder mystery . or maybe it's a romance , eh ? it doesn't really matter , cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting , that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them , or the film as a whole . if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack , this film might've had a chance to be more than what it is now . which is an unentertaining , crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab-bag of stupid voice-overs , overdone songs , melodramatic romance , undeveloped story and uneven acting . i only wish that i could make that one hour and forty-five minutes of my life re-appear , but alas , it is lost in the spiritual world of " interesting ideas gone wildly awry " . little known facts about this film and its stars : this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman . co-screenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997's batman & robin . director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours . 
" jack frost , " is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . this does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn't spend nearly enough time with them . when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . halfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies . switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack's death . when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack's spirit . jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . " frosty the snowman , " is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn't work at all . after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , " jack frost , " quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , " what happens after you die ? " or , " how does it feel to be a snowman ? " but instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . the performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this . michael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? i have always liked kelly preston . she is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997's , " nothing to lose , " and , " addicted to love . " joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . in one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son . since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : " you da man , " says charlie . " no , i da snowman , " replies jack . or how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : " snowdad is better than no dad . " do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? the snowman , created by john henson's creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year's unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , " jack frost , " but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . either way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . as a seasonal holiday picture , " jack frost , " is pretty much a clunker . a better christmas film from this year is , " i'll be home for christmas . " better yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , " it's a wonderful life , " " a christmas story , " or , " prancer . " " jack frost , " is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better . i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway . 
" spawn " may be somewhat of an older film . in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) . but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing . it wasn't the worst film of year by any means . it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year . but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my " worst of 1997 " list . the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year . performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy . in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness ! even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality . i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy , but something about it seemed . . . well , annoyingly unprofessional . john leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite . he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional . but the main problem i found with " spawn " , as with most films that wind up on my " worst of " lists , is that it was just plain boring . i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film . sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion . never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way . even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year , it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again . like i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small . i was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me . and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created . but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game . who knows if " spawn : the video game " wasn't part of the plan from the beginning ? keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all . but none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something i'd recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission . this movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn't really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing . if you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be ! trust me ! " spawn " has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers ! 
the tagline on random hearts reads " in a perfect world , they never would have met . " in a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . although they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . the rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . all the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . kay's distraction from the film's primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . these sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . random hearts' two primary characters seem to live in shells . although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . there is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . veteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . other than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . however , it is also hard to compliment it . had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . 
back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . he couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados . that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products . the hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them . chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) . surviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent . he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians . since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action . well , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting . it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films . we know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . in the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . during the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . that caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . the photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it . 
do the folks at disney have no common decency ? they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick . wasn't mr . magoo enough , people ? obviously not . inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment . younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity . the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle . all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite . as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain . in the cartoon , dr . claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer . we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat . as a child , i always imagined what dr . claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years . with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . . rupert everett ? ! only now , dr . claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' ) . he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version . it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far . when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool . he does still have his cat , though . in the title role , matthew broderick looks lost . the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers . broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people . he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics . but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world . john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames . in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys . and so is born inspector gadget . as bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes . broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city . and there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' alas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle . there are so many tired plot additions . gadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l . hughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian . both are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children . well , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) . and don't even get me started about the villains . i didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust . the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . penny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action . the special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over . the problem here lies solely in the script . perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . here is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway . 
starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960's classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it either . fast forward to the late '80's . steve mcqueen isn't in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . that is unless you count matt dillon's brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original's . unlike the original , they don't look campy , they just look cheap . one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . in terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . anyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . the more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . and it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either . anyway , it attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . not really , but that is how it seems . this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . as i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . although , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . although some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . sadly , it doesn't work very well . if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . ( although that isn't so hot either . ) this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities . 
deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) cleans fish tanks . yeah , i didn't know that was a real job either . one of his customers is antoine leconte ( oded fehr ) , a successful gigolo . when antoine has to go to sweden for three weeks , he lets deuce use his house to look after an ailing $800 fish . fooling around , deuce sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a $6000 fish tank . after taking a try at one of antoine's clients and earning $10 , deuce decides to prostitute himself to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fiery-tempered antoine returns . enter t . j . ( eddie griffin ) , a pimp for " man-whores , " who arranges for deuce to service an assortment of women whose imperfections keep them from dating . there's an enormous woman ( played by transvestite porn star chi chi la rue ) who hides food in her clothes . there's claire ( gail o'grady ) whose narcolepsy causes her to fall asleep every few minutes . tina ( torsten voges ) is so tall her face doesn't fit on the screen , and ruth ( amy poehler ) has tourette's syndrome and shouts obscenities without warning . finally there's kate ( arija bareikis ) whose sorority sisters secretly paid her fare . she seems perfect , and deuce quickly falls in love with her . ( she does , we discover later , have an imperfection , but deuce decides it isn't important . ) deuce's life is complicated by a bothersome cop ( william forsythe ) looking for information on antoine and by kate's discovery of his man-whoring . however , neither threat generates much suspense . the formula is so familiar that we know how it will end from the start . " deuce bigalow " is the first project from adam sandler's company happy madison , the formation of which assures that we'll be seeing the sandler style of comedy mass-produced at an increasing rate in years to come . be afraid . be very afraid . the good news is that sandler doesn't actually appear in " deuce " and that rob schneider and eddie griffin are funnier than sandler . schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but good-hearted deuce believable . griffin's delivery is dead-on , especially in the coining of " technical terms " for t . j . 's profession , as in " don't make me he-bitch man-slap you ! " there's the expected amount of toilet humor in " deuce . " ( for one thing , deuce's dad is a men's room attendant ) . does anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny ? for most of us , i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the far-side of puberty and discover how funny sex is . i , for one , will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed . bottom line : " deuce " doesn't offer anything new but it is intermittently funny . 
attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone . should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic . the film will work just as well as a silent movie . chronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing . first-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth . there isn't one of these characters worth caring about . the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of " people magazine . " among others , the movie features : ben affleck , casey affleck , david chappelle , janeane garofalo , gaby hoffmann , catherine kellner , courtney love , jay mohr , martha plimpton , christina ricci and paul rudd . and unlike people magazine , the people speak , not that they have anything interesting to say . it's new year's eve in 1981 , and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party . structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party , director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars . monica's apartment is in " noho , " an area that one of the guests describes as " so cool , all of the poor people live there . " typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin ( paul rudd ) and his friend and would-be sexual partner lucy ( courtney love ) . they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone , except him , of course . she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her , which turns out to be neither erotic , funny or successful -- rather like the rest of the story . the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year's eve birthday . " cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people , " kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie . another character , played by jay mohr , has a problem with his sexual triumphs . every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning . when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him , his response is " i like a lot of people . " as the movie finally draws to a close , the characters awaken from their post-party game of musical beds . some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little , while others actually have some clue as to what happened . the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot , all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind , which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie . 200 cigarettes runs 1 : 40 . it is rated r for profanity , sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers . 
ahh yes . the teenage romance . an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . along now comes `down to you' . the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . well , only happen in the movies . fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . `10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . no such luck with `down to you' . it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . only in the movies' . 
some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time . playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one . congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing . some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed . then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet . harsh ? maybe . justified ? hell yes ! this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes . for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away . this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : " oooh , look look ! john woo ! two guns blazing ! slooooow motion ! " and if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie . poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better . unlike most movies this one does not suffer from " stupid bad guy " syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes . example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages . now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero . ( term used as loosely as possible ) survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . solution ? boom ! i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? no thanks , i'll just ditch it in the back of my car . and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? for instance : our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several " oh come on ! " moments . 
supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 . john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails . a world renound hunter , remington ( michael douglas ) , is called in and the battle , man against lion , begins . this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery . the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin . we only see one side of each character . kilmer is a bridge builder and that's all we see him as . these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn't even appear to be too upset about it . and the plot ? it's jaws , but with lions . again we're presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should . it appears to kill men because it just likes too . why ? who knows . i guess there wouldn't be much of a story if it didn't . the problem is that there isn't much of a story even though it does . 
to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery . it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history . it has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible . worse , there's the promise of a sequel . why ? ! save your money . some films go quickly to video . this one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre . ' in the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species . most of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) . survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives . the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons . dimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage . ' travolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth . much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations . he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter . but one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth . when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan . he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site . it's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it . the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader . a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how . but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox . this enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment . it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors . `we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says . `but first , we need a few more supplies . ' in days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts . by now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl . the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel . numerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning . and after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree . this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? at a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer . both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity . in addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga . this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen . the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder . this led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages . but the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable . if the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader . like terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave . could that be the scientology message ? 
what would you do if no one could see you ? well , if you're a super smart bio-molecular research scientist working for the military , you'd grope a co-worker and rough-up your neighbor from across the street . that's right . of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible , in " hollow man " kevin bacon's character opts to commit sex crimes . er , it's kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? something sounds horribly wrong already . but this is a paul verhoeven film , and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as " basic instinct " and the infamous " showgirls " never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which , when you come right down to it , is all this film is about . " hollow man " features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don't look much better than those used in the 1933 version of " the invisible man . " oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of " thermal " shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support . since invisibility , once achieved , isn't much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon's character gets invisible he can head straight for them . it's as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . as a horror film , " hollow man " is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars . it's minor verhoeven--and even that's not saying much--and boy is it hollow . 
there ? s nothing quite like a gory anime . really , and this is the truth , no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it . with anime , a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two , and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword . this is a standard practice in anime , or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ? ve seen . vampire hunter d is a gory , gory film . if they ever made a live version of the film , it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx . it ? s not that it ? s gore is unique - it ? s just like other gory animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it ? s story , characters , animation , etc . . . it really didn ? t . it was disgusting and gruesome , which overshadowed the story , what little of it there was . it seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world , because god knows that our local police force just can ? t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies . one evening , a blond peasant girl , drawn to look 17 and innocent ( a foreshadow that we will see her naked , i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene ) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire ( insert strom thurmand joke here . ) of course , he never put a ? no trespassing ? sign on his yard , so one can ? t really blame her , but he ? s upset anyway and demands retribution . she gets the obligatory bite on the neck ( aren ? t there other places to get blood from ? it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough . if it's good enough for doctors to draw blood from , then why do vampires stray from that sight ? ) to fight the spell , she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall , dark and handsome vampire hunter ( you guessed it , his name is d ) . the vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires , being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much . you see , like all heroes in these kinds of stories , he ? s a brooder , who ? s sole purpose in life is to remain really , really silent . when he speaks , it ? s in cliches . heroes like this are bad when they ? re live , even worse when animated . later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire , who wants to marry the peasant girl because he ? s bored after 10 , 000 years of living ( the only clever vampire insight made in the movie ) , will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time ? will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable ? in it ? s defense , the animation , when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing , could at times be original . the talking hand was clever - and i think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo . and that ? s the best defense i can think of . i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans , but i really don ? t see it . it ? s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth , blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks , and most importantly , like all violent anime , it is an excuse to see animated breasts . why ? what is the point of that ? maybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny . i ? m not a prude , i just don ? t think it ? s warranted . it puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost . is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower ? of course not ? it ? s done for shock . it ? s tasteless and despicable . 
my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . i love ralph fiennes . i love uma thurman . i love sean connery . hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations . this is a lousy , incoherent mess . i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . this is just plain depressing . the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode . i wasn't alive then . i don't even watch television now . i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . his name is de wynter ( connery ) . he is a crazy scottish guy . our heroes had better stop him , or else . . . the weather will keep getting colder until they " have to go to hell to warm up " ( one of the film's few funny lines ) . along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . and i guarantee you , it will wane . i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think . the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens . there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut . in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . they aren't . the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . they aren't , either . and what about this wasted cast ? oh , it makes me weep with disappointment . we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . i love the guy . i've loved all his films , until this one . he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are . and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here . ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . who is to blame ? is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . is it the actors ? for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with . his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design . the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits . but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here . inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . or a sense of purpose . most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . damn this movie for not giving them the chance . 
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . " quick , robin ! the anti-shark repellant ! " - adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode . another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . mr . schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . is batman and robin supposed to be campy ? i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted " bomb ! " each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is . arnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . mr . schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of " cool ! " in the least inventive way . george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . his batman is hardly an imposing figure . chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . the film's one saving grace ? undoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . her work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . ms . thurman's comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . ( i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever . ) her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers . i figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a half-bad way to go . while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . it's been a long time since i've laughed so much at a movie . " at " , of course , is the operative word . 
when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn't scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august . happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater . unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory . worse , actually . fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read " laura palmer's secret diary . " for " twin peaks " junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved . the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish . the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon . the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper . lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later . ah , twin peaks : " familiar territory , " you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in . wrong ! the movie proves that you really can't go home again , or at least lynch can't . only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos . the rest of the " twin peaks " cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv's most enigmatic town . cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna . the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth . the night of laura's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film's only remotely effective sequence . we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere . her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful " twin peaks " viewers . but it's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie . 
another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . ummm ! 
here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me . on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . in fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? probably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the " mastermind " ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there's no one on board . the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad's cinque ) . williams , once a " can't miss " prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . given her limited acting abilities , it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . meanwhile , kevin j . o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it's impossible to tell where they end and where " reality " begins . in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its kind . like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . 
staring , george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone . well to start this off i'd just like to say a couple things . first is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence . not even from the first film was batman really the 'star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway . in 'batman forever' and now in 'batman & robin' he's almost pushed to being a bit player . i can't really say if clooney ( who regardless was better than kilmer ) was a very good batman or not . he's given next to nothing to do at all , he might as well not have been there and it wouldn't have made much difference . now , joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark . fine , i mean granted 'batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes . yet his bright neon , campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me . i'm usually very easy on films . i loved 'con air' and other films some critics have slammed . granted that film really was paper thin , cliche ridden , except for one thing , it was fun . there is virtually no fun in this film at all . i couldn't have cared less . it'll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really , none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing . schwarzenegger is awful , i mean really , really bad . . . and this is coming from a regular fan of his work . i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them . he talks all to often in this movie . i would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll . i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film . i liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot . 
m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . john woo ( " broken arrow " / " face/off " ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense . the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing . the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . in seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first " mission , " who is noted for doing " chinatown " -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . the terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . ethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean's getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick's everyone's ass . if i was only entertained by this . . . i could have lived with it . but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . in any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . 
the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . with she's all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . however , you wouldn't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . they have accidentally killed one of their own , the " teen dream " , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . now the three surviving girls must decide what to do . it takes little time at all for the group's leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique's final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth . the girls' cover is surely blown . . . not so fast . thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance . after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful " new girl " at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd . does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? or will this finely honed plan crack over time ? jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add . it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor . it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot . the film's most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo . at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths . but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops . the film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film . in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best . as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she's in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) . it's a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . ) jawbreaker doesn't quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie . either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows . the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters . as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn't really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable . " detestable " is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker . it's certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film's title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience . 
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . but smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . with john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . 
the formula is simple . trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one . these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few ) . so , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . ) perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas . deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film . treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no questions asked . this time , however , they may have gone too far . their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films . and their cargo . . . let's just say it has very high explosive potential . what is the target of these thieves ? why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . but something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something ancient and deadly . by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . and now the creature senses fresh meat ! so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . and the monster gets to pick them off one by one . fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be . it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o'connor's whining engine-boy , under finnegan's employ . his constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . they all had a set of " rules " about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn't have a set of rules . . . or if it does , not a very good one . it merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . it simply happens . the action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . deep rising's peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron's ( but can you really blame them ) . unfortunately , deep rising's efforts are more on par with speed 2 . on the plus side , however , the film's closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . perhaps you'd be better off waiting for that one . 
the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars . producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze . gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry . cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed . seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos . fifty cars , to be exact . poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly . if the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip . literally . if only someone could save him . hmmmm . . wonder what memphis is doing ? in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of . . . yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension . shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away . will he catch him ? there's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago . will they get back together ? shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family . will they reconnect ? raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime . will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ? can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ? i'll bet you can . following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis . he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts . in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions . just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it . looks like everything might turn out alright after all . you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins . that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame . bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand . monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis . or maybe it's just the cars . duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit . i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one . lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material . the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis . without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie . like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal . too bad his minutes onscreen are so few . somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes . every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie . there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot . it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test . imagine the yuks . there's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick . it's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk . the ramifications are never explored . then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars . not only is it stupid , but it's against the law . this is a movie made of pretty , but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along . gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining , but empty film to leave your memory . 
one-sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do . for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . we're still here . the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . we're still here . some of the more ludicrous moments come when it's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . also , there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . if it's anything like it's depicted as here then it's going to be incredibly boring . the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video . it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed . also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . audio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . certainly i never expected a remastered print . curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . but they're menu screens . . . so who really cares ?

possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk . it smashed u . s box office office records in it's opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here . but is it any good ? in a word , no . i'll elaborate further . the story is as follows . apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on . one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened . ( see jurrasic park . ) imgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago . realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island . enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there . so , basically , what you have is this . two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs' firm intentions on eating them . a fairly good idea , however it's let down by one slight problem . it's crap . over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky . add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested . it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , 'what's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ? ' ( yes , you should ) . it's a shame then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park . with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c . g . i dinosaurs ( the t . rex's have to be seen to be believed ) , there is nothing else to recommend the lost world . a very dissapointing sequel , indeed . 
martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger . he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck . they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) . i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked " under siege " ) . of course , this one , as a change , has a " message " that is drilled into our mind . . . of course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people . so why do i watch his crap ? i usually don't . i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i . e . " executive decision " ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i . e . " executive decision " ) . but this one has a special place in my heart . this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it . this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la " mystery science theatre 3000 , " and this was a couple years before i had heard of " mystery science theatre 3000 . " in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new " fire down below , " another " message film " ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or does he ? seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , of course . at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up . he even goes as far as to say , " i don't want to kill someone , " and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . i have no problem with violence . i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's " con air . " but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer's mind . the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers . what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . as far as seagal and his acting , he's rather boring . he squints , he kills . period . nothing else . oh , yeah , there's corny one-liners ( " i'm gonna reach out and touch someone ! " ) . of course , he's the star , and we're supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . michael caine , who's a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold . he does it well , i guess , but this is no " alfie . " of coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him . his big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible . and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from " full metal jacket " ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal's ego . and also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey's assasins . anyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal's movies is to judge all of them ( except for " under siege " and " executive decision , " though the latter is not really a " seagal movie " ) . they all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch . i mean , if you do rent it , and i don't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one . my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) 
in french , the phrase " film noir " literally means " black film . " webster defines it as " a type of crime film featuring cynical malevolent characters in a sleazy setting and an ominous atmosphere that is conveyed by shadowy photography and foreboding background music . " classic film noir , including such memorable fare as " the big sleep , " the original " cape fear , " and orson welles' striking " a touch of evil , " employed black and white photography to emphasize the long shadows associated with the genre . color came into play with neo-noir films like " chinatown " and " blade runner . " " l . a . confidential , " easily the best film of 1997 , is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking . for a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an absolute mess , there's " palmetto . " based on " just another sucker , " a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , " palmetto " shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance . director volker schlondorff ( " tin drum , " the handmaid's tale " ) stated " we weren't even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy . " it shows . " palmetto " is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy . the story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison . someone turned state's witness and revealed that harry was framed , a " reward " for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto . bitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto . while hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth . harry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket . no problem , though . the radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry . rhea needs " a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom " for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny . ) the girls want to bilk a half-million dollar " ransom " from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam . things go wrong , of course . odette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks . in an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d . a . 's office . they need a press liaison to field questions about odette's kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job . not a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone . the actors don't know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further . as if that wasn't enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic . woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts , but he's lost here . presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged , it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme . harrelson clearly doesn't know what to do with harry's character , so he spends most of the film glowering , sweating and generally acting miserable . meanwhile , elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance , behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide . as the stepdaughter , chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr . despite a number of steamy scenes , there's no chemistry between harrelson and the women . to make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's lips are running over each others bodies . two particularly bad scenes highlight the film's problems . while driving with a body in his trunk , harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up . the officer wants to help change harry's flat tire and asks him to open the trunk . harry's pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy , but under schlondorff's grim direction , the scene is just embarrassing . the film's nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina . we're supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid , but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip . had " palmetto " been played with tongue firmly in cheek , it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story . but under the harsh direction of schlondorff , the film is just a sluggish paint-by-numbers exercise in neo- noir cluelessness . avoid this nonsense and go see " l . a . confidential " instead . 
1 . he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2 . he doesn't always speak in a monotone , and 3 . his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression . in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful . one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery . as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers . unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy . to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture . firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot . the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people . during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive . flash-forward a year . now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) . but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual . a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom . led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border . along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) . eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy . firestorm's director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it's no surprise that the film looks good . unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen . these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game . the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating . everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions . there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat . as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache . he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero . my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume . there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list . ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . ) and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie . as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm . 
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . it would be derisive . it would be glib . it would be dismissive . it would be entirely accurate . rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . ) meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice . serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching . 
deserves recognition for : achieving the near-impossible task of making a grander monument to self-love than steven seagal's on deadly ground . capsule review : a question : after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld , what in the @$&% were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post-apocalyptic movie thinking ? in this 3 hour advertisement for his new hair weave , costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employee's uniform and gradually turns a nuked-out usa into an idealized hippy-dippy society . ( judging by the costuming at the end of the movie , the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re-inventing polyester . ) when he's not pointing the camera directly at himself , director costner does have a nice visual sense , and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust-no-one 90's ; but by the time the second hour rolled around , i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes . mark this one " return to sender " . 
much ado about nothing . ah , how sweet the irony ! it's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . he just doesn't " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say . the bard's work is apparently beyond criticism . what a load of old cobblers . if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh's film of shakespeare's " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it's time to get a life . get monty python . get woody allen . get john waters . whatever . just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy . and banish this nonsense to where it belongs . drama and tragedy was shakespeare's strength . to my sensibilities - and i'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn't seen her in ages . but boy , does she owe me one ! i won't spend too much time on the plot . basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . there's some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you'd hardly know it . mind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story . good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound . nothing wrong with most of the cast , either . branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers . the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare's original text . light comedy shouldn't be complex . yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh . the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something . but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame . this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold . ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl ! ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! ho , ho , ho , she's so awfully clumsy ! oh please ! there's wit in here somewhere , i'm told . i call it pretentious . something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . in the end , it's cringeworthy . watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . comedy ? bah , humbug ! 
an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices . that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow . that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source . the acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie . a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better . on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot . the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing . as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener . all these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough . the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions . matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) . there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this . the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it . i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it . all in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch . although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them . i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie . 
my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " ) languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture . with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host . he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant . one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone . the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . after throwing out constant one-liners ( " either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . " ) , sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die . to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . matthew pointed out that it " is not as good as it could have been or should have been . " ( amen . ) he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . 
" from the director of " the nightmare before christmas " it said in the previews , which i'm guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million . to each it's own however , since " monkey bone " is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made . a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects . stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena " monkey bone " a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder . when stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you'll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i'm guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life . people are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them . when stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can't stand ) he tries to keep him under control . making a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life . when monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu's body . now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares . . . or something like that . rather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) " monkey bone " had potential in the script and even the story . what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development . for instance we really don't get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her . the cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body . bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast . dave foley isn't given enough to do , as well as " will & grace's " megan mullally who can be funny . the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust . the special effects of " monkey bone " is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes . some of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don't realize that he is animated . . . but on occasion it sneaks up on you . the direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn't know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff . it's too bad really , " monkey bone " could have been a real good movie , but with it's heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role . for those curious however , it might be worth the rental , but other than that avoid this one . 
plot : upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes , two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself , since the school's charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide . critique : despite this film's interesting premise and dark subject matter , this movie sucks because it is unfunny , boring , and presents us with one of tom everett scott's worst acting performances . add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element , many lame and corny jokes , a long wait for the setup , and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this " black comedy " ( if you're gonna create a black comedy , don't chicken out in the end-see very bad things ( 8/10 ) for a perfect example ) , and you've got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter . i barely laughed at any gags , found the bong element contrived and repetitive , and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie ( if you're gonna make a bad college comedy , at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids : ) . this one's not even worth the rental , fellas . skip it altogether ! little known facts about this film and its stars : during auditions for that thing you do ! , tom everett scott's first feature film role , director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could've passed for hanks 15 years ago . it wasn't until hanks' wife rita wilson saw the audition tape , and decided he was cute , that hanks decided to risk hiring scott . the actor who played scott cooper in this film , mark-paul gosselaar , is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv's " saved by the bell " . his parents are dutch and named hans and paula . and who would've guessed that this is director alan cohn's first shot at directing a feature film ? 
walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia . but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about . disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules . with anastasia , fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window . some may say - so what ? it's just a kid's movie . well . . . if you have young kids , beware , as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way . consider yourselves warned . nevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times . don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality . and yet in other scenes , the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd , which leads me to wonder . . . was this rushed to market to combat disney ? the plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 . not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened . as for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe . you'll see 60% of anastasia there . 
synopsis : a maniac , crazed by virulent microphage , slaughters more than twenty people , including a street gang and heavily-armed troops , with a small knife . even with a handgun , however , he can't take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times . comments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge . not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess ) . henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) how on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me . adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . boston has changed dramatically in those ten years . it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with " policia " printed on their doors . some guy has a really bad virus , and he's killing people because of it . so , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . that's it . 76 minutes never seemed so long . this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character . the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . in her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . twenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . in a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . this fake passport drops to the ground . lambert's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . must not have been a good fake . this emphasizes another fault with the film . things just defy common sense . lambert's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . i found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert . don't fear the rush . fear the movie . watch something else . 
the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . if you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . but , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . for instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers . they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers . that title would be the confusing . ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly . it basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb . liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth . the haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money . before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . first , the house is great- looking . it looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot . it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it . this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film . things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie . the hill house is not eerie . it is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening . ever heard of lili taylor ? before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film . despite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind . owen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor . he is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas . all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped . wilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs . liam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film . their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot . they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting's coffin . the plot is terrible . the opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film . as i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . nell , lili taylor's character , goes from the hunted to the savior . it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film . he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information . for instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program . but , we get zilch for the other four . plus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes . and the worst part : most horror films have killings . for some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film . no reason whatsoever , just off with his head , literally . overall , the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie . bad plot , confusing storyline and a waste of good talent . hopefully , liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential . hopefully , lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film . and hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one . 
i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder . i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house . so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie . but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place . the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house . when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids . actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever . when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says " he's not my son . " obviously . all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy was nine months ago . so the white-faced freak leaves his neverland ranch for the state home and faces the ridicule of other kids . that is , until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him " wear " his spoon ( " you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass . " decisions , decisions . . . ) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the table . so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy , his mother must be sissy spacek's carrie character . and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes , as we find out powder has some sort of super-intelligence ( " your i . q . test went straight off the chart ! " ) and attracts electrical power . this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school ( if he's such a genius already , why would he need a high school education ? ) and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblum's science class . goldblum plugs in a " jacob's ladder " device that shows current running up two wires and immediately the current flows across the room and into powder's chest . but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching , instead of just unplugging the damn thing . i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row ( following hideaway and nine months ) . that's about all i saw before the big fight began and , let me tell you , that was twice as interesting as the movie itself . but like i said , i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization . none of these movies ever handle the subject properly , instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guy's personality , overlooking his personal appearance . i already had the female character picked out ( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene ) , but i guess i'll never know for sure what happened . from noraruth@aol . com mon jun 10 15 : 04 : 03 edt 1996 article : 3654 of rec . arts . movies . reviews path : nntphub . cb . att . com ! not-for-mail from : noraruth@aol . com ( andrew hicks ) newsgroups : rec . arts . movies . reviews , rec . arts . sf . reviews subject : review : powder ( 1995 ) followup-to : rec . arts . movies . current-films , rec . arts . sf . movies date : 10 jun 1996 18 : 16 : 03 gmt organization : university of missouri - columbia lines : 70 sender : ecl@mtcts1 . att . com ( evelyn c . leeper ) approved : ecl@mtcts1 . att . com message-id : " > reply-to : noraruth@aol . com ( andrew hicks ) nntp-posting-host : mtcts2 . mt . lucent . com summary : r . a . m . r . #05425 keywords : author=hicks originator : ecl@mtcts2 xref : nntphub . cb . att . com rec . arts . movies . reviews : 3654 rec . arts . sf . reviews : 710 status : ro powder a film review by andrew hicks copyright 1996 andrew hicks / fatboy productions i've never written a review for a movie i haven't watched all the way through , but i had to make an exception with powder . i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friend's house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house . so i never got to finish the movie and i'm sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie . but i can at least get a partial review out of it , because i saw enough to know this one wasn't worth finishing in the first place . the movie centers around a freaky teenager who's spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents' house . when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him ) , social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ? gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he's a different from the other kids . actually , we find out he's different when we first see him , because he's the most pale individual we've ever seen and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever . when powder is born in the opening minutes of the movie , the father takes one look at him and says " he's not my son .

edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working-class relationship picture . however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist . and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work . claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life . she's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she's going nowhere . her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job . if she were to marry him , she'd never get a chance to escape this town . enter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia's old flame . he skipped town several years before , without any explanations . . . even for claudia . he has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn . should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown . . . or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again . part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man . . . and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return . now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes . at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre . unfortunately , it seems much much longer . the storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious . edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame . there's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked . he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons . . . yeah , right . lauren holly does what she can with her central character . but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions . . . and we never really care . bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie . his acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with . there's not much to recommend in no looking back . it's not that the film is bad . . . it's simply boring . there's no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it . 
a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps , all of whom are african-american . an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession . it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho's , and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get . i learned that the word " bitch " is their favorite word , as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used . it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money . it's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place . this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears . these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face . the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite . also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life . we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd . they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money . these dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves . " priests need nuns , '' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp . " doctors need nurses . so ho's need pimps . '' as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors . the race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human . while , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community . we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations . the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work . there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being " macks " and " players " or " real pimps " and " perpetrator pimps , " but no further clarity is attempted . it is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word . the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to . danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe . while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer . 
plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio , after they complete the " final cut " without him . he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision . critique : wow . i really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels ! the " comedy " in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) . the plot is uninteresting , boring and bad . the structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious . the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can't act to save his life . the cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks . all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite . i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one . see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it . luckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective . by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ? who knows , who cares , this " satire " sucks the bag . little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker . this was after the film's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his . the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis . eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack . he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him . he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack . this film practically swept the " razzie awards " in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the " worst picture " award , the " worst screenplay " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst supporting actor " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst new star " ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the " worst original song " ( " i wanna be mike ovitz ! " as written by joe eszterhas ) . 
what are we going to do with jim carrey ? viewers of television's " in living color " know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill . viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way . unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective . three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin . the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl . for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short . carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami . he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect . he even does his captain kirk impersonation . again . all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey . ( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . ) export it to france and you may have a hit . as it stands , ace ventura isn't even good kid's stuff . the profanity count , alone , is too high . which is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey's best audience . the film doesn't even have the goofball charm of chris elliott's recent no-brainer cabin boy . sure , carrey has his moments . but what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from " mission impossible ? " ace ventura has one glaring incongruity . amid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny " crying game " gag . and , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones . 
when the mediums in question are video game and feature film , has there ever been a respective here-to-there transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle-headed mediocrity ? " super mario bros . , " " street fighter " and " mortal kombat " were silly stinkers all , and now the empty , execrable " wing commander " joins their lowly ranks . enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci-fi , easily the worst of its kind , is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes - that is to say , there's little fun to be had when you're not the one holding the joystick . the movie , then , is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts , who created the original , groundbreaking pc incarnation of " wing commander " back in 1990 . how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a head-scratcher . " wing commander " 's story , credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney , is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas . it rips off the finest films of its genre , top gun and , in one scene , even those spiffy " stereoscopic freeze " gap commercials . set in 2654 , " wing commander " stars freddie prinze jr . as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him . along the way , he plays kissy-face with his stoic superior ( saffron burrows ) at the new galaxy hangout where he's posted , comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his " pilgrim " heritage ( don't ask ) , and goes on a top-secret mission involving the " jump coordinates " ( what , no death star plans ? ) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi . or something like that . given the immensely confusing activity , it's hard to tell . on the other hand , what's easy to see is that " wing commander " is a big old mess . the lame dialogue strains , filled with such original lines as " don't you die on me ! " , " battle stations ! " and repeated ( and frequently unanswered ) calls for a " medic ! " action sequences fizzle . the character conflict garners unintentional giggles . the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like , as they're kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes . imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a ? 50s roger corman cheapie and you've got a good idea . little but techno-babble happens for an hour , and then it's as if " wing commander " tries to do too much at once ; when it appears as though the movie's about to show signs of a pulse , it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before . matthew lillard , featured prominently in said sequence , is cast as prinze's hotshot partner , and though the two are fine young actors - recently paired in the hit " she's all that " - they're fighting more than otherworldly evil here . rumor has it that " wing commander " was slated as a later-in-the-year release , bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new " star wars : episode i " trailer . but in my audience , there were no females present to make goo-goo eyes at prinze or lillard , and many a member exited after the much-ballyhooed sneak peek . since most cineplexes won't be granting refunds to the latter contingency , " commander " might rake in some dough , but be warned : the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation . 
ripe with explosions , mass death and really weird hairdos , tsui hark's " double team " must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career . actually , in " double team , " neither's performance is all that bad . i've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it's just that he's never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994's " timecop . " and rodman . . . well , he's pretty much rodman . he's extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert . it's the story that needs some major work . van damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros' son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as " the colony " -- a think tank for soldiers " too valuable to kill " but " too dangerous to set free . " quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . so , what's a kickboxing mercenary to do ? quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . with crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman's lite brite locks , " double team " should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . but too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what's going on in the movie . and much of what's going on is just wacky . there's a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn's baby boy ( who's in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers . did i mention " double team " is strange ? when it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity . rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona , though , leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs . but we didn't need " double team " to tell us he could do that , did we ? 
if snake eyes were a dog , you'd put it to sleep . if it was a couch , you'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week . if it were your child , you'd be reading military school catalogs . if it were a ship -- no , it wouldn't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez . ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip . for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup . this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . ) snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ? if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ? is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ? will someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer . if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate . the trailer is a work of sheer genius . it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot . the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross . ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie . the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match . unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot . the trailer gives away much , too much of the story . the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy . the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is . without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level . as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit . de palma is maddeningly inconsistent . he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) . on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) . snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value . the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor . there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done . this is what's called giving the devil his due . but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie . placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years . snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent . cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better . the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind . however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps . 
" lake placid " marks yet another entry in the series of " predator pics " that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- " jaws " ) and were revived recently by the godawful " anaconda . " " placid " claims to be a " horror/comedy " -it's directed by the same guy who did " house " -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of " anaconda . " paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . they're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . along the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while " jaws " -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist . unlike its slippery cousin " anaconda , " " lake placid " wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . the result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious . while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of " friday the 13th " and " halloween h20 " ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like " ally mcbeal " and " chicago hope " ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick . the body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . ( " lake placid " manages to have it both ways-i'll let you discover how for yourself ) . the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . like the snake in " anaconda , " the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . " lake placid " also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how " we really don't know much about crocodiles . " they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . a movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? creature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . most of the time , they're probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . platt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . 
'traffic violation' dr . daniel's review of u-turn dr . d's rating : critical condition ( okay , here's the deal . i'll be the first one to grant that everybody needs a day off now and then . i'll even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well . i mean , hey , i've been known to stretch a weekend into a three-day outing , if friday looks to be a slow day . and if monday ain't looking like a pick-me-up , well , i've been known to give martha nell a call and say , " do me a favor , sweetheart . bump old man ferguson's boil lancing to tuesday morning , and tell miss audrey that i'll swing by her house monday evening and see if we can't get her trick knee back in line . " a simple sentence like that , and i've got a nice four-day fishing trip with the boys , or more often than not , a trip up to cherokee , n . c . , for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery . but the point is , if you take a day off , do something different . if you've worked yourself silly for months , relax a bit . sleep in . eat pancakes at noon . microwave an egg in its shell . watch pro wrestling with the sound off . listen to some barry white records at high speed . whatever . but do not , under any circumstances , spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living . and , if you do , don't make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time . because i do not want to hear your sob stories , oliver stone . you apparently thought you needed a break from making " important films . " cool . so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie . that's cool , too . but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade . i'm just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , " what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? " and i'll stand there staring 'til i get a straight answer . sean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter who's had some troubles a while back . he's heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an " ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick " of a mechanic named darrell . while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what's cooking . is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ? probably not . bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues . just as those issues are starting up , grace's husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention . just beats bobby silly . bobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again , and jake asks bobby to kill grace . a little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake . them murderous arizonians . gotta love 'em . if any of this sounds familiar , congratulations . you win a kewpie doll . the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction . but the contest doesn't end there , guys and gals . we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty . we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak . look at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick . bobby as terminator ? stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . okay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas . i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . too bad it's not fun to watch when it's happening to us . . . while we sit through this mess of a film . u-turn is not a bad film if you're a fan of technique . it's the oliver stone you've always known . robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . but pictures of what ? i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years . oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it . and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . that's fine . but don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one . do some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) do a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world . but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as " an oliver stone movie , " and not question why it stinks like week-old snook . there's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun . this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail . 
one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : " it's only when things are over that they make sense . " whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . but don't fret , it will surface again . you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . but you hold hope for some time . the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , " how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . steven spielberg is picked on in particular . while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . the days of breathless are no more . 
the first in a very long list of things wrong with " i still know what you did last summer " is the title . think about it for a second . if the last movie was called " i know what you did last summer " , wouldn't the next movie have to be " i still know what you did two summers ago " ? if anyone working on this movie had an i . q . greater than five would have thought about it logically and said , " hey . . . wait a minute " . but alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won't hold them to that . what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick . i guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the " kind of " ) . it wasn't great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did . there are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start . first of all , i guess , is the setting . the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting . exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ? the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through . in one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can't get out , no matter how hard she tries . when julie discovers she's going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue . now , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin' thing off ? in another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , " just don't tell anybody it rained the whole time . " oh yeah , i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i'll crack jokes anyway . after all , it is in the script . the film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the " re-animator himself , jeffrey combs . he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie . way to go , jeffrey . i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it's head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson . with " scream " and even it's sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter . his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think " i still know " has really suffered by not having him on board . the cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one . even though the movie doesn't have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two " scream " s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other . i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another " the killer is back ! " cliffhanger , he said " who is this time , the grandma ? " all in all , " i still know " tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt . i mean , it's okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . . 
ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting . the story is very minimal and basic . there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming . when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) . gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans . on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties . sounds great huh , well it's not . the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work . the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds . there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa . the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back . i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage . they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor . the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan . mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw . she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face . now what didn't work in this movie ? that would be the rest of it . the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless . the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . i like wrestling . i watch it at home and laugh . it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it . this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . the movie was too dim-witted to be funny . it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever . a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads . at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good . the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's " bawitdaba " and " cowboy " . martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up . it's utterly ridiculous . the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie . the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it . if you're going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it's actually entertaining . the wrestling is betters , they're funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . oh and the girls are hotter . is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ? don't waste your money . 
starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the " savages " that live there . the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments . the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while " slightly " misguided , is good at heart . pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . she even comes complete with insignificant best friend . again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work . the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , " colors of the wind . " mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . even the children in the audience seemed restless . while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled . even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with " savages , " why did he so quickly change his previous " kill as many indians as i can " attitude . if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . as it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression . in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . 
in the james bond film " diamonds are forever , " tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads . bond's response is that it doesn't really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match . well , collars and cuffs don't match in " the real blonde . " what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen . the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin . it plays like an " ally mcbeal " episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary " fantasy " sequences . writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea . it isn't . the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary . matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent . he's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas . " that's not really acting " he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex . but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video . but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after " showgirls " ) . this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes . dicillo has referred to " the real blonde " as " off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff . . . " the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who's not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting . catherine keener , who's appeared in dicillo's previous three films ( including the brilliant " living in oblivion " ) , is at her most annoying in " the real blonde . " look at her closely ; she really can't act at all . her reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars . she reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations . she moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much . she frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks . maxwell caulfield plays joe's actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a " natural " blonde . bob's personality ( not to mention caulfield's acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera " passion crest " --stiff and uninteresting . maybe that's the point . daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera . hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she's only 37 ) . why is that ? almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples . why is that ! ? marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer . kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent . buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink . christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer . and so on . the best parts of the " the real blonde " are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog . there's more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film . while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters' lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it's funny . 
stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama . the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . keital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . this film should be brilliant . it sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance . however , it can't hold up . although the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them . in fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . in this film , serious means dull . the dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . the plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . in fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances . however , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance . however , it's not all that bad . as said above , the action scenes are well done . theres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well . in fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 . if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending . cop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film . hugely disappointing , and i can't really recommend it . 
this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while . with this film , plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors . his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship' seemed fake . but not everything bad in the film was the director's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors . it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) . casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school . no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first . while `total' was written well , `starship' is purely pathetic . all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) . as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours . half of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210' ( dina meyer was in " beverly hills " ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images . the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects . there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around . i wonder what the insects eat , if there's nothing but them on the planets ? there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended . this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality . but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind . the pointless plot begins when johnny's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth . johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents . but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose . and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid . anyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league . dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also . they then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat . and guess what ? that's about as complex as it gets . oh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it . he's my fifth nom for a razzie . the troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act . naturally , they win , or sort of half-win . of course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs . the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? isn't it also amazing that earthlings haven't invented better hand-held weapons by then ? the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero . well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) . 
yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex . stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn't look more bored . their characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there . one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . everything about it annoyed the hell out of me . the acting , and script , the plot , and ending . the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film . the " big " stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality . i felt like i was watching dawson's creek episode 200 . although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast . the " surprise " ending was sooo predictable . since when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? go is dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's all that = go home and watch something else . 
i want to be involved in show business one day . and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse . this movie proves it for me . i was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up . i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne . they didn't . kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles . this film is different . the cast is still impressive , but here , not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction ( he's one of those directors who's good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith doesn't really give an impressive cast anything to do . the cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman , o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could've casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy . the major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze . his accent is so heavy , you can't understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act , and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody'll notice . that's the trouble with me , * i * notice . schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does . patrick stewart was the person i'd heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would've been so much better . or sean connery , but not arnold " i'm not an actor , but i play one in real life " schwarzenegger . i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would've been nice if they'd casted a star that had talent for the role . akiva goldsmith's screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film . in a regular batman film , they'd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson's julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is . there is talk of a fifth batman movie . my interest to see it is low , but i hope it's better than this . if you don't want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster . any other . 
synopsis : original " jurassic park " survivor alan grant ( neill ) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby ( macy and leoni ) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur , to rescue their stranded son . grant's team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar , and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought . review : there is one reason why " jurassic park iii " is better than its immediate predecessor , " the lost world : jurassic park " . the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life ; the former , only 94 . the first " park " was a marvellous film , full of awe-inspiring sights , interesting characters , and genuine thrills . its two successors have been pale imitations , amounting to hundred-million-dollar b-grade horror movies . at least this third entry realises it ; whereas " the lost world " tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot , " jurassic park iii " simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin . there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting , and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation . remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie ? nothing in this rehash even comes close . add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman , payne and taylor , and phoned-in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni , and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts . at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character , and there is much less gore than in " the lost world " , making this installment more suitable for children . 
warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . the one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever . trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy . ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment . he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome . the opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon . ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws . hint : it sounds like splat . ) the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat . with his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes . the rest of the film is just more of the same . sure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ? writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups . instead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny . the better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see . though an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten . the script is virtually devoid of wit . tribal mask jokes ? jerry lewis cameos ? forget it . if anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor's ultimate challenge . just how long * can * they keep a straight face ? 
ingredients : possessed plastic dolls in love , plastic dolls having sex starring : jennifer tilly , voice of brad dourif , katherine heigl , nick stabile , john ritter synopsis : this is the fourth film in the chucky series , which debuted in the late 1980s . basically , chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer . in bride of chucky , chucky's longtime girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo . dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey , where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans . the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple , so in the side plot , the couple suspects each other of being a murderer . opinion : bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor , but doesn't succeed . somehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky . and tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany . the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the first half , and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half . the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic . 
there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a " wiseguy " . regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino . more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's . just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a " damn you mcbain ! " i hear from springfield way ? ) so the movie is cliched . big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . donnie brasco fails on both counts . the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino's well-earned high style . the consequences are painful to watch . its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent . perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn't so true after all . 
for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what's left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . as a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . generally , though , the actor doesn't matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . russell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . the movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we're into todd's later years . he's about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . the pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he's the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie's start . between the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it's possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . director paul anderson , who helmed last year's icy thriller , event horizon , doesn't show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . todd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a " routine patrol " and set the stage for the final firefight . events are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . it's not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . a strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . 
topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end . it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - " we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related " - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained . with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . such a disappointment after such a brilliant start . the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . as stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . 
what hath kevin williamson wrought ? while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films . those williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_ . add to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy . the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas . first , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling . this sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer's look . dressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman , sans the hook . one thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise . students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of " mythology " passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness . it hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn't ) . michelle , slain by the " killer lurking in the backseat " of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well . the setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares . too many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door . but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there's also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre . banks and horta's ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor . some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so . the filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent . i was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _ starlet jennifer love hewitt , but i'd talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man , jared leto . _dawson's_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor . granted , the cast is hampered by their material . loretta devine , who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard . the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely , kevin williamson--to stay alive . if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers' many victims . 
the following review encompasses two versions of dune : dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . * * * the review * * * released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to " fold space " and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands . one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . what a great idea ! why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them . and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . dune is also a very serous film . the constant " self-talk " by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy . the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight . both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . see it in the widescreen format if you can . and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends . as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . the conclusion ? any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests . the extended version , however , is a rather different beast . in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition " director's cut " of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with " allen smithee " , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous " judas booth " . certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline . paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior . as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book . the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his " heart plug " . its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the " alan smithee " version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been . on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . 
a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise . after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) , love . so far , so mediocre . but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance . it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . not that there is much of a romance to begin with . try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . when celine and robert start to overtly act on their " feelings , " it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing " beyond the sea " at a karaoke bar . after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . a life less ordinary certainly delivers something " different , " but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . " i can accept failure . everyone fails at something . but i can't accept not trying . it doesn't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . " --michael jordan 
phil ( radmar jao ) has a hairy problem . his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour . he recently met the author of a non-fiction book on lycanthropy , also referred to in the movie as werewolfism , and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf . using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention , he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him . and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs . made on a pittance , the film features an almost exclusively asian-american cast . as directed by quentin lee and justin lin , the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films . jeanne chin plays katherine , a meek and soft-spoken wife , who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex . we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins , real and imagined , to her therapist . as her husband , jim , clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness . the picture is filled with stereotypes . there's a mysterious , loud-mouthed waitress with a big , platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she's a lesbian . she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer , a gay guy . and the lone white with a major role , the author on werewolfism , has wildly unkempt , orangey blonde , curly hair . from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist , the script rarely has anything to offer . the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad-libbing . one can only hope that the directors' next film will have some substance and some credible acting . shopping for fangs runs 1 : 30 . it is rated r for sex , violence , and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers . 
coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work . divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases . to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives . this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . the actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . signy coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . but she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway . 
burnt money is the perfect festival film . it will show once or twice , and then no one , thankfully , will ever have to hear from it again . this film from the seattle international film festival 2001's emerging masters series is easily one of the year's worst . billed as a gay `bonnie and clyde' , this gritty film from director marcelo pi ? eyro has its only highlight in a well-designed title sequence . two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader , whose plan they screwed up , angry . this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys , one of whom may not actually be gay . hiding out in a prostitute's apartment , the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie's conclusion . if caught , they risk losing all the money , and their love . as an added emotional bonus , one of the gay men is dying . or something like that . everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost . clarity isn't exactly this movie's striving virtue , so it was a little hard to pick up . not much could have really happened though . the main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex , graphic drug use , extreme violence , and strong language . lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there's a reason , but there's no purpose to anything in this film . most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly , while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing . it appears pi ? eyro ( who co-wrote with marcelo figueras , from a novel by ricardo piglia ) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement . he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible , makes them snort cocaine , gives them guns and condoms , and lets them go . burnt money is pointless . the performances are bad . it tries to thrill and shock , but only causes boredom . god forbid it will ever get a distributor . another disappointing film from this year's so-called emerging masters series . pass on by . 
you don't need to have seen the original " species " to appreciate how utterly lousy " species ii " is . with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that " species ii " is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable . it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . that should have been the end of the movie right there . back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again " played " by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing . this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to " the dukes of hazzard " tv show , which she appears to enjoy . eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk " mates , " which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) . eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on . peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams " i told 'em not to go ! " at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns . they're both unbelievably wooden . what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( " the ruling class , " " the krays , " " let him have it " ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder . it's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like " species ii . " last year peter hyams gave us " the relic " ; no thanks necessary there . and the first " species " was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects . is it just that there are no better offers out there ? " species ii " is worthless . worse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn . it's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film . there is . after 92 minutes , it ends . 
starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . sure . william baldwin isn't a bad actor . unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . if it was the latter , it worked . cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? well , i'm glad you asked that question . cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? by the end of the movie you won't care . the story is so contrived it isn't funny . anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . as for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . 
it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . what drags braveheart down is its screenplay . it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . but this does not save a misguided script . the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his " heroism " is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . but wallace's actions paint a different story . he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . this is evident of a " spartacus complex " , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . horner's score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . this drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . 
there are scenes in " the big hit " that are so awful , they simply defy description . the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made " last action hero " ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . presumably , " the big hit " is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off . movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . " lethal weapon 2 " ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny . unfortunately , in " the big hit , " it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . unfortunately , there are no laughs . the movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence . instead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's " boogie nights . " however , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market . wahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see " grosse pointe blank " for the same character , much better developed ) . the movie wants us to think , " gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him . " the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money . his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst . melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) . one day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . however , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter . so , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by " jurassic park , " and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen ) . what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of " king kong lives , " which is two weeks overdue . this mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( " face/off " ) , who also served as executive producer . woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . wong , who directed such films as " rock'n'roll cop " back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they're not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey's script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is " it's all love " ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco's stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole . 
tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies . and here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes . i didn't expect much from this latest " interpretation " of pierre boulle's classic novel planet of the apes . i mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those " damn dirty apes , " in one of his best roles of his career ? sadly , i sat down to watch burton's version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . this time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot . leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered " smart " chimps into the storms to collect data . leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he's thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo's ship . along the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! in the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene . while rick baker's makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the " surprise " ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple . wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences . this remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film . the ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human . even chuck heston's anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey . but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton . even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film . even joel schumacher could have directed this film . he probably should have . burton's predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one's place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee's big adventure , are completely absent in this planet . i suppose that's what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole . 
the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . alas , it refers to our heroes ! as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . but the human race doesn't have much to worry about . after all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . they're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters . lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship . soon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened . finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation . when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising . i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative . virus takes itself seriously . and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming . but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out . okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity . they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) . on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people . after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around . the leader , of course , is a big creature . every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around . virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening . it's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there . on one level , virus is almost passable fun . it's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) . there's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) . the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie . it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes . 
vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family . as with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors . this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles . also back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes . in vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows . it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue . apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn't bother to write any jokes into the script . at least that's the way it looks when watching this turkey . about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point . by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags . i might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in . they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film . the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures . rusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film's best moments . every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film . which brings me to the best moment of the film . the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play . christie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by . it was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen . too bad . 
susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros . ) thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero . now , more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend . the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown . and an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security . but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept . plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) . working from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can . the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography , luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " american outlaws " is a galloping , formulaic 3 . it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie . 
it's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . she can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island . accompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie . but was this contest too good to be true ? the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . as you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook . julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing " i will survive " at the karaoke bar and the words scroll " i still know . . . " ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . but the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it's going to be the worst vacation of her life . the funny ( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness . there isn't even any suspense that leads up to the deaths . here's an appropriate example . knock-knock . " housekeeping " , says the diminuitive cleaning lady . the door suddenly opens up . slash . next victim ! is there any reason to go and see this movie ? not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes . but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me . i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell , who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido . i secretly wished for him to get filleted . did he get 'hooked' ? well , let's just say that if he didn't , i would give this film a grade of " d " . 
the happy bastard's quick movie review damn that y2k bug . it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . little do they know the power within . . . going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . here , it's just " hey , let's chase these people around with some robots " . the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . 
i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984's " the company of wolves , " to 1992's " the crying game , " and 1994's " interview with a vampire . " his latest film , " the butcher boy , " is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming . told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life . his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore . francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder . the premise of , " the butcher boy , " is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works . francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him . this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well . the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay . the supporting characters are no help , though . rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter . he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout . shaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her . and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice . the pacing is all off in , " the butcher boy . " although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while . it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs . at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it . i'd rather think of , " the butcher boy , " as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire . he has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film . what could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore . 
chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying . i think i fall into the former category ( i'm one of the few who thought his turn in " the fifth element " as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle " money talks " just doesn't do him service . tucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he's also really the only thing good about the movie . in fact , if you see " money talks , " it should shock you beyond recognition that two of " toy story " 's writers penned the sloppy script . tucker's role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . but villard's thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . the local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . he makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . this means james must present his new " friend " in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . " this ain't no buddy movie , " claim the print ads . yeah , right . actually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears " money talks " has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . this is tucker's first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . but you realize all too quickly that tucker's overstated liveliness is the only thing " money talks " has going for it . and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . it's all too easy to pick out everything wrong with " money talks . " the plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when " nothing to lose " employed it last month . everything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . the villains , as many as there are , are dull . certain story elements are too coincidental . and too much of the film's dramatic agenda is played too straight . a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin's true identity ( " you brought a killer into my parents' house ! " ) is extremely silly . you get the picture . obviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at " money talks . " but the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . but tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie's best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone's son at james and grace's engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . tucker's audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like " money talks . " those who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails . 
part buddy comedy , part fish-out-of-water story , part nature tale , meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes . in fact , it is an invitation you ought to disregard . phil and stew deedle ( paul walker and steve van wormer ) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire , elton deedle ( eric braeden ) , founder of deedle enterprises . elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune . . . instead the two are careless hawaiian surf bums . to set them straight , he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp , to which the pair inevitably go . after several misadventures in wyoming , where the duo is stunned to discover there's no surf , the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot . they arrive at yellowstone national park , where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits . rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad , the deedles play along . phil , actually , has other motives : the beautiful park ranger jesse ( a . j . langer ) , who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine ( john ashton ) . yellowstone has a problem . it's only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday , and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs . not just one or two . . . thousands of them . the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p . dog menace , not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater ( dennis hopper ) . the brothers deedle aren't supposed to be out-and-out stupid , like the team from dumb and dumber , or bill and ted . instead , their brains just operate in a different , simpler , realm . a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board , a film which , unfortunately , this one resembles in several hideous ways . the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn't funny . there's a moment when phil utters the line , " insert laugh here " , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience . the result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way . instead , it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way . the cast seems decent , but they're never asked to do anything remotely interesting . instead , the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest , and with constant annoying references to other disney films . you'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles . 
the word to describe sharon stone is " wonder " . not that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent . she has a dynamic screen presence in " basic instinct " , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in " casino " , but possesses neither of those here . stone teams up with private school headmaster's wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani's thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) . in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to' [read " steal from " ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he's not dead or maybe . . . kathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective . her character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling . adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . it's stone that is a disappointment among the actors . how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ? costumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous . even the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out . on the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive . that is if you can put up with stone's cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch's movies . 
although i had not been a viewer of the " rugrats " television series , i went into their first animated feature film , " the rugrats movie , " with a positive attitude . the trailer looked cute enough , after all . after seeing it , i think the words in my recent " antz " review , in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995's " the pebble and the penguin , " were a bit premature . " the rugrats movie , " is bottom-of-the-barrel children's fare at its worst , and starts to make , " antz " look good in comparison . as in the show , " the rugrats movie , " is about a group of very little friends , ranging from babies to a three-year-old . the head of the group , tommy pickles ( e . g . daily ) , becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill ( get it ? dill pickles ? . . . hardee-har-har ! ) and is informed by his three-year-old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children . when the other children , chuckie , and twins lil and phil , suggest taking dill back to the hospital , tommy goes along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and become lost , running into wolves and circus monkeys , among other things . " the rugrats movie , " judging from the idea of being lost in the woods , could have been a potentially fun family film , and there were many different things that could have been done with the story . so what did the writers choose to do ? why , they set up a protracted , cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall , of course ! for the youngest of children ( ages 3-7 ) , " the rugrats movie , " may very well entertain them , judging from the audience i saw this with . of course , if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents , they were all desperately struggling to stay awake , and that included me . for an adult , " the rugrats movie , " is a piece of garbage . the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm . there isn't one laugh to be had in the film , nor is there any excitement . if anything is even marginally good in the picture , it is the bright animation style , so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn't to service a more quality film . " the rugrats movie " is doa from the start . i am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful . as said before , young children may like it , but even they deserve better than this . for adults , it is a nearly unbearable , excruciating chore to sit through . as for me , " the rugrats movie , " is not the worst of the year , nor is it the most deeply hated , but it is the most boring . parents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of , " the wizard of oz . " that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which , " the rugrats movie , " is completely missing . 
" nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy " showgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence . some people , however , keep their clothes on . you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them . that's why this review will be short . it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores . there is no story , script , point or acting . only naked bodies , which is exactly the point . here is the so called plot : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile . no one is twisting nomi's arm . no one is holding her grandmother hostage . she wants to do this . and that is what she is doing till the end credits . so what's the problem then ? what's the point ? what's the film about ? is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ? this film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer's intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck . believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody . elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas' script . her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better . her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public . " i am not a whore ! i am a dancer " , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing . in fact the acting in " showgirls " brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level . not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning . it is a total waste of time and money . there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence . the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another . its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe . " in my films , " writes director paul verhoeven ( 'basic instinct' , 'total recall' ) , " i hold the mirror up to life . " well , excuse me ? his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it " show the naked truth " , is simplified and unreal . occasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : " hey , i see you . i see that you're hiding " - " from what ? " - " from you " . yes , and even the only decent line in this film : " nomi is what las vegas is all about " can't save 'showgirls' from going under . it's a strange phenomena . it's not erotic , because it lacks sensuality . not dramatic , because it lacks the acting . and not intelligent because it lacks a story . it is simply verhoven's bad excuse for making pornography . you want to see naked women ? bare breasts ? full frontals ? it's nothing wrong with that . but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas' pathetic dialogue . b qualities , while it's only a high budget porn-film . 
the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it's only 80 minutes long and when it's over you're glad that you didn't waste more than an hour and a half of your time . it's nothing more than a bad rip-off of , " jaws " ( and i think that's being kind . ) it was written by david e . kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both , miserably . i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda . " the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . there's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets . as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don't go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either . the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they're all basically idiots . if they had any brains the croc wouldn't have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did . but then again , if they were smart there wouldn't be a movie . basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered . 
the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties . produce something , anything , that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens . the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here . gross humor , sex jokes , silly sight gags , more sex jokes . and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder , grosser and more outrageous than that last film . what the film is not , however , is funny . the plot centers around the return of dr . evil , who goes back in time to steal austin powers' mojo ( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin's pelvis ) which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies . austin must go after him , and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday . i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original . but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews . i wish i had stuck to my first impression . myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation . and he has the talent to do it , at least as an actor . but the material he is working with here , much of it his own , falls short of anything resembling comic genius . this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces , a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack , and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old . after some of these scenes , one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention . the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor . for the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show . there is no sense of comic timing or subtlety . the director just throws the material at us , giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director . i am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd , at least the one's who have yet to discover literacy . certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in your face , kick you in the teeth , take no prisoners , ( action-verb +blah blah blah ) . ' if you see the film and you find you're not laughing , there is nothing wrong with you . it just means you grew up since seventh grade . 
surrounded by hype , high hopes , and the promise of an over-the-top performance by clueless's brittany murphy , don't say a word looked full of promise . hell , when i hear that " i'll never tell " whisper on the tv commercial , goose bumps run up my spine . alas , word is filled with little but disappointment , a kooky mix of girl , interrupted and ransom , with michael douglas and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping thriller . douglas stars as nathan conrad , renowned new york psychologist , devoted father of jessie conrad ( skye mccole bartusiak ) , and loving husband to aggie conrad ( famke janssen ) . after a gang of jewel thieves , headed by sean bean's koster , kidnaps his daughter , nathan is forced to extract from his new patient , the catatonic and violent elisabeth burrows ( murphy ) , the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago . but with hard-nosed detective sandra cassidy ( jennifer esposito , doing her best j . lo impression ) tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums , the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth's head in order to get the goods inside . the catch - nathan only has until five o'clock to solve the puzzle ! whoa , the suspense is almost too much . don't say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes . murphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie , then turns around and reprises like her role from girl , interrupted . and the only real " crazy " to be found in the film is director gary fleder's ( things to do in denver when you're dead ) staggering use of flashback sequences . oliver platt , famke janssen , and even sean bean are decent actors , but the stuff they are given here -- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch -- is insulting and demeaning . additionally , the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan's every move is downright unbelievable . how do ex-cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment ? despite its flaws , don't say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you'll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up . americans love lukewarm , half-baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills . someone get me my lithium ! 
in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . whichever one you like , dear , he says . and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . i liked that scene for two reasons . first , the cakes looked really cool . second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society . it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there . it's as if someone told pitt , " never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . " it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . i've used the phrase " angel of death " in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels . where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks . the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black . sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately . he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . ) hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure . i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why . movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now . go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death . -- curtis edmonds " no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn't stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time . in the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . personally , i'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you'd expect from someone named yahoo . the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth . whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity . although yahoo's performance is at first endearing , the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 . yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . but after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the " 1812 overture " and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . but it wasn't until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms . in fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn't raise any eyebrows . 
it's a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from japan , because " titan a . e . " is proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it . i don't know what this film is supposed to be about . from what i can tell it's about a young man named kale who's one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race . that's a fine premise for an action-packed sci-fi animated movie , but there's no payoff . the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil " dredge " aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason . so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights , fistfights , blaster fights and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick at . there's so much pointless sci-fi banter it's too much to take . the galaxy here is a total rip-off of the " star wars " universe the creators don't bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing , the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring . despite the fantastic animation and special effects , it's just not an interesting movie . 
the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon . as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque . the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude . when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style " chance brushstrokes . " starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie . the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections . the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man . daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer . when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex . he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed . he thinks that francis's paintings have " no bloody use , " and the movie presents no counterargument . writer maybury barely outlines francis's character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma . we learn little of george other than francis's reason for liking him -- george's " amorality and innocence . " francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often . " boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , " he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match . as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood . francis appears to be in complete ecstasy . another of francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities . as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience . in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident . francis's mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother , the father , and the boy . sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis's wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful . ( " i'm optimistic by nature . i'm optimistic about nothing . " " loneliness is my only true companion . " ) we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself . he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth . full of metaphorical interpretations , the film's best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom . mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly . like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling . by the end , the audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute sketch . love is the devil runs 1 : 30 . the film is not rated but should be considered nc-17 for violence , profanity , graphic sex , nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers . 
* * * be warned . . . the following review contains some harsh language * * * the blair witch project . quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time . if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy . my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more . and this worked for him . well , i'm sorry , but nothing . . . is nothing ! ! ! ! ! nothing is not more . it's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! . i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing . " nothing " is free , available all around the world at a location near you . i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary . i could just discount them and say , " well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow . " but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold water . there must be some other reason . ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time . this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout " josh ! ! " over and over . this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost . . . and argue with each other . oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting " josh ! ! " . and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear . oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks . you've never seen terror like this folks , and you don't want to . the chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film . ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . ) this film is an example of marketing with no substance . the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film . they want this film to be good . and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything else to praise . that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it . this film could have been so much better . just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff . i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it . she was sold on this film . and then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked ' . . . are we supposed to be scared by this ? ' . i've heard one opinion that you " have to use your imagination " to create the fear in this movie . well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . use their imagination and create a good movie . i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it . but even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? an entity called the blair witch ? some rednecks fucking with these kids ? are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? i've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something . well sure thats scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting . you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it wouldn't be . and no , a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy . actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) . but you have to do something . you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real . and by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch . aren't these supposed to be " filmmakers " who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ? i'm not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that's justified . i'm talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can't seem to shoot anything smoothly at all . minor quibble there . there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers . that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank . and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves " what was i thinking ? ? " . but , if they don't , then thats fine . if it works for them then that's okay i guess . i just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the " nothing is more " approach . pretty soon we're going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . for 90 minutes . and we'll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , " my god , wouldn't it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! this movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! " . or , a shot of a coffin , with some funeral directors arguing with each other . " man , do you know how scary it would be to die ? ? ? ! ! ! ! now this is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! !

the real blonde ( r ) a woman's face , an arm , some pumped-up pectorals , blond hair , a man's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and there . as the opening credits of tom dicillo's the real blonde unfold , these scattered , fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts . if only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently . joe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas . he's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender . mary , a makeup artist , regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson ) , who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney's the little mermaid . the bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again , off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah ) . as the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary's shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe's path . where exactly does all this go ? that's a question best posed to writer-director dicillo , who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue himself . his meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac . and another . and another . at one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth . that is most certainly the case here . joe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself . unhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied . if there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , aren't digressions at all . the real blonde is not without some amusements . it does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest ) . but on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface , but there's nothing going on inside .

the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from " l . a . confidential " to " palmetto " to " the big lebowski , " has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . " wild things " could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . overacted , overwrought and overlong , " wild things " is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , " wild things " not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . directed by john mcnaughton ( " henry : portrait of a serial killer " ) , " wild things " follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community . particularly one . kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . next thing , she cries rape . and the so-called " roller-coaster ride " ensues . a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer . he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . as ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie . the community is astonished . reporters flee to the scene . there's an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) . there's the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . like so many thrillers these days , including " the usual suspects " and " the game , " " wild things " eschews character for plot . mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany " henry , " a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . george clinton's score is a delight to behold . but it's the humans . the characters are mere devices for the " nasty " twists . what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don't feel real or we don't care for them . not even the unintentionally funny moments work . the people in " wild things " are not so much people as they are caricatures . then there's the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon's member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . ironically , the wildest elements of " wild things " are not wild at all . 
a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel . well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man . the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it . no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable . the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist . the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) . to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks . some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less . none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control . this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable . all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects . the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves . it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish . also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ? if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ? regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it . as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about . the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles . having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe . watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely . the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening . so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed . as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect . this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv . 
in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . in the second , he was avenging his daughter . in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . kersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . white's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . the plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting . however , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics . ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) . 
" spice world " is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while . actually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . but overall , who cares ? not me . if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . in " spice world " they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews . amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money . and they keep babbling about " girl power " when they should really be talking about " cleavage power " . i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film . by the way , there's something in the opening credits which says " based on an idea by the spice girls " . wow , they got idea credit ! i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . . giving credit for simply having the thought " say girls , let's make a movie ! " the supporting cast fares well . roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing " chief " of the spice girls , and darn it all , he's fun to watch . mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e . grant ) . one question though : george wendt ? you'd think that " spice world " would envoke one of two reactions in people . if you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards . and if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then " spice world " will really make you sick . oddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film . well , not the two who sat directly behind me . they kept muttering " this is stupid " over and over again . maybe there is hope for humanity after all .

there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been . the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets . to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews . jakob , however , never stops moving . it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset . he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision . the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior . after a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near . when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto . the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes . a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive . this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the " ordinary person " in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his " serious " roles with every passing year . compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) . jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them . when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky . oh yes , and then there's that little girl . some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar . they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships . jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . 
the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . . and , in the future , it's also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole . naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . . the movie . when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the " lewis and clark " has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the " event horizon , " gets to come along for the ride . if you've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is " infinite terror . " well , i don't know about the " terror " part , but " infinite " certainly seems to qualify . . . event horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film . it starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes . at least for those first 40 minutes it's an * interesting * rip-off of alien . that's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever . it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller . it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore . you've seen this kind of movie before . the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility . this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price . there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably . paul anderson's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat . there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity . the sets are beautiful to gaze upon . and richard t . jones' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has . and none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film . the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one . a haunted house story in space isn't such a bad idea . but the final execution is extremely disappointing . that's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn't have talent . for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that's something that not too many writers can do . he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) . he definitely has something of a gift , but it's not fully on display here . i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne's sentiment - " god help us . "

seen at : amc old pasadena 8 , pasadena , ca ( in sdds ) paul verhoeven's last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a " plot " ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity . it stank . starship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a " plot " that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore . it stinks . nobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here's a brief synopsis anyway . some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy . after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared . this involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs' planet . much carnage ensues . the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call . more carnage ensues . after being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a " brain bug " which is believed to be controlling the aliens' battle plans ( look , i didn't write this , ok ? ) . yet more carnage ensues . get the picture ? interspersed throughout all this are brief " ads " from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo-fascist state , much like in verhoeven's robocop . there are many problems with starship troopers . the plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly . harris ( star of tv's doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a " brain bug " later on . in addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210 . the characters are one-dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it's ok because she got to sleep with rico . i had hoped that verhoeven's use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him . the dialogue is embarassing and isn't helped by the frequently terrible delivery ( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species ) . finally , the fake " ads " become a nuisance . although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii-era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to ) , their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect . some people will say all of that's irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes . so what about those battle scenes ? well , i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly , especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs . and people have their brains blown out , their limbs cut off , and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways . but this is my problem . the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore , and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards' character vomits on-screen ) . verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success , but fails spectacularly . while robocop had a message about the importance of being human , and gave the bad guys some motivation , starship troopers lacks even these simple features . when the brain bug sucks out a character's brain near the end of the film , it's merely an analogy for what the film has done to us . this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16 . 
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . it's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . any hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half . the film's central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . nick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide . nick casually asks for terry's wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . of course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . learning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry's compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him . this is a promising premise , and mr . taylor's film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . this is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux . however , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable . unfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film's leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . far from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . mr . taylor's dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as " you should have asked something more interesting , like 'do you enjoy the pain ? ' - see , that's provocative , leaves room for further questions . " ) the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick's acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . this occurs particularly often during the film's opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i'm realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it's painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick's scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . the entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . among the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang's swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . mr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . the charge of dream with the fishes's protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . for dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die . 
capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie . the gags are sporadically funny . it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) a film needs a plot . it needs characters for empathy value . it needs a story and an emotional center . if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . there was not enough cleverness or variety . it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . penis jokes work only so many times . showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . this leaves them at loose ends . they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . jay has to be the comic . he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . the film does not offer much to an adult audience . i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep . he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour . then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food . then he took down a volume of shakespeare's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot . and then , as a climax , he took out his video camera and pressed the " on " button . the result ? william shakespeare's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure . though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure . the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds . this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we can't see what is going on . and filming the dialogue in voice over . and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model . and making the frame go still while flashing the character's name at the bottom . and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion . i mean , man , this is the 90s , dude . however i've seen terrible films that are fun to watch . ( examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau . ) that rule doesn't apply here . this is a film that takes itself seriously . that is it's major fault . another problem was pointed out by my friend , alex ( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout . ) ; the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didn't take sides . here it's clear that we are supposed to side with romeo . ( just look at the way they film him . ) from the begining he's our hero and this doesn't work . and dicaprio's awful performance doesn't help . luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us . the result is a mess . you can feel him striving to be something he isn't . he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles . he tries very hard . key word : tries . " oh look , he's filming above water action from below . pretty . what does it represent ? " why do people do ugly things ? i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face . 
disconnect the phone line . don't accept the charges . do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . `hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . this is an annoying and ineffective device . cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . `georgia' . maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . ryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . her frenzy is apparent . for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . even so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . but really , it's no mystery . the predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . it's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . uh-uh . it's a wrong number from the beginning . 
the most absurd remake of 1998 ? it's a toss up between gus van sant's psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture . ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . ) there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period . ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . ) and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it's also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it . theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers . that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers . enter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment . joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe's demise . suffice it to say , the movie could have been called " joe : ape in the city . " theron ( so good in devil's advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising . the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg's the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , " look , joe's headed for the movie theatre ! " followed by a shot of joe scaling mann's chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like " look , joe's headed for an amusement park ! " and what do you know , there's joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers . the seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves . the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way . underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands . ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . ) i did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching . ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker's make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show-yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love . ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . ) to be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it's a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue . it's certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe's not on camera may bore them to tears . ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron's colourful array of tank tops . ) i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don't make ? em like they used to . 
barb wire , pamela anderson lee's first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets . being the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character's catch line , " don't call me babe , " sound very ironic indeed . from the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe . throughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson's , then at least of the female extras . this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire . for a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline . it is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) . known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi-style uniforms . in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts , barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom . even the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet . there are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of " barb wire . " if anything , one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts . who could fight and jump in a skimpy , strapless leather top , and yet keep her breasts from spilling out ? only a stuntwoman . not pamela anderson lee . 
the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . it's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense . and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . he's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown . that's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . nick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life . what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . i'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . i'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . i'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . there's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story . one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense . i don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director . i'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act . one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner . he's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . ) there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . there's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . the plot itself never straightens out . i'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . the sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? one too many , i'd imagine . foley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch . i also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over . the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to . 
hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . unfortunately " romeo must die " bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms . the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family . a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . the following morning po sing is found dead . suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death . " romeo must die " is in many ways a fun film . it is both absurd and assured . the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes " the godfather " . the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's " china girl " , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film . an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin . the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and " romeo must die " does look good . but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . the best things about the film are its fight scenes . jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . one needs only to see his film " fist of legend " to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that " lethal weapon 4 " ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow . unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . also " romeo must die " must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's " streetfighter " , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . it's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . one problem though about the fight scenes . those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . they do have an internal rhythm to them . a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . here in " romeo must die " , there is no staccato . every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . the rhythm is monotonous . a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . 'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . . watch the restaurant fight from the film " rush hour " and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . now look at the warehouse fight from " rumble in the bronx " . there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath . the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . here in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . jet li is a grand and personable screen presence . it's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . until then , we'll be left with emotionally hollow product like " the replacement killer " and , currently " romeo must die " . 
this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . however , even if one thinks of it as fiction , " the prince of egypt " remains shallow . but i'll begin from the beginning . the biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero . maybe it's just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i'd have a little bit more confidence . there are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah's death like it's nothing but a thing . most of all , though , the story's focus has shifted . rather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , " the prince of egypt " is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses . i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin . rameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses' butt , even though moses was the one who started it . . . * yawn * i didn't care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) . but enough about the differences . let's talk about the movie itself . it features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn't convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is . it features a cookie-cutter " i-wanna-please-dada " rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler's list , among other things ) . the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the " new-improved " miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) . speaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music . it contains shallow writing . it features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film . most of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god . i am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy . the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story . 
i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! we'll have a hit on our hands ! " the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's . the usual things happen like clockwork . the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . it's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . the replacements offers none of this . 
boy , what a great movie ! ! keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot . how could this not be a blockbuster ? all die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on . ol " much ado about nothing " plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago . to help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university . by happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics . this project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in . a potential solution to the earth's energy problems without the pollution cost . surely nobody could have any problems with that ? morgan freeman is paul shannon , the project's sponsor . he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public . he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly . so he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location . unfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script . this movie is just dying for a comparison with " the fugitive " . both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change much , i guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere . the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward . credit to them , but we aren't really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters . where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves' character is never given the time to develop . it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while . harrison ford was " the man against the world . " he was alone in a world where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well . in chain reaction , keanu reeves isn't alone . now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion . we don't get this . we get him thinking he's still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn't drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie . the producers here probably thought , " hey , what if keanu and rachel don't hit it off too well ? let's rope in that morgan to help us out . " well , keanu and rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn't help much either . the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder . it's not really his fault . once again , andrew davis just doesn't take the time to build his characters . someone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . 
" desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic . it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more " before and after " than " reversal of fortune . " the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of " desperate measures " boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . one misstep " desperate measures " makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness . what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . whatever . to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems . first and foremost is how cheaply " desperate measures " trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; " desperate measures " appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . cast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective . although he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . joseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . it goes without saying that " desperate measures " needs an operation of its very own . 
in this year's summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as " a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . " one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements . the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness . it's a large family , but there's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio . jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family , but she's kind of a hypocrite since she's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) . her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration . also , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy , sexy jadzia ? hala is a spoiled , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy . with such an unappealing set of characters , it's no surprise that _polish_wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving . naturally , jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop , russell schuster ( adam trese ) , who fathered the child , but he refuses to make such a commitment . ho-hum . another complication , involving the decidedly un-virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary , is first played for laughs and then , inexplicably , as a profound statement in the film's climax--which , ironically , is funnier than any of the film's lame attempts at humor , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell . that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly . the jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers . the hala-russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived a manner , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something . and then there's some atrocious dialogue , which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound : " look at all these pickles . just looking at them gives me such great sadness . " as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is , the affair is something of a letdown , considering the strong performances by byrne , danes , and especially the fiery olin . they obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share . 
ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life . unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie . actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie . not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . but no one has arrived yet . her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . those who are invited are the ones that have the issues . it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . but it didn't happen that way . the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . 
lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . after the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . ' opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) anakin is annoying and unlikeable . , instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . the actors don't help the movie much either . liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . he's not even very 'cute . ' the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . the cgi takes away much of the human element , however . the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . episode 1 is just disappointing . it's got high production values , but little else . the music is meandering , except near the end . the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . the effects are nice , but dull . the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . disappointing is barely the word . rating= 
overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson's novel " the haunting of hill house " ) stars lili taylor as one of three " lab rats " that participate in a supposed " insomnia " study being initiated by liam neeson . he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it . he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of " creepy " cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience's patience . i know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ? the original was a great psychological horror film . this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary . in fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary . unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there's nothing in this film that will raise hackles . i nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn't seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed . it's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly . owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's going on as the rest of them do . finally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her . apparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor's characters was filmed but removed . that's too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . this is jan de bont's second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying . what our mind fashions on it's own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . apparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it's original title . i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont's version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had .

i've always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances . the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it . besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film . i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , " wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . " ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . ) the film began . . . . the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett . he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon . ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it . ) they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him . brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her . the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual . kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't . the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference . his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party . there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity . kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations . the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding . kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . . if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending . . . . instead of saying " i do " in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says " i'm gay . " this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart . most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy . it reminded me of the " effeminate heterosexual " sketch from saturday night live . it was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline's performance made it doubly so . however , after the wedding , the film drags on . they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done . he reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him . there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless . finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending . the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , " he's gay . " it got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film . by the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon . ( much like this review you are saying ) overall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets . see it in economy time . 
paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2 . that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic . it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . but why ? his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . the kind who just won't die . hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( " i've lost cohesion again ! " ) . they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush's republican national convention speech ( i . e . bush referring to clinton ; " ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? to what end ? " -- this actually got applause ! suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd ) . the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ? ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) . they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself . caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger . it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow . like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than " audiences will pay for anything these days " . it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride . verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care . the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick . how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . verhoeven delivers the sleazy " goods " , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . " are you looking at me ? " , she queries , obviously haunted . it's a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) . those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer . and they're the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental . you've been warned . but you probably won't listen , will you ? tis' a pity ? ? ? 
when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the " inspector gadget " tv show with my older brother . truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis . i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that . sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up . so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) . i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness . as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones . when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( " oh , hi penny ! is brain with you ? " ) . creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . the " plot " , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series . matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) , a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events . brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . . inspector gadget ! >from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) . there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these " treats " . i was just glad that it was over . 
capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie . presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock . i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art . no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already . i thought : it's about these two cops . and they're buddies , sort of . they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other . and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots . and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship . and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying . and the bad guy is a drug lord . and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way . and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down . i only missed the bit about the badges . the rest i got dead-on . and i hadn't even left the video store yet . the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo . smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds . this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's " not getting any " , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's " back door man " . not funny ; tiresome . bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence . will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . . and men in black . he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself . martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial . movies like this are not about originality . i know this . they are about style and energy and synergy between actors . i know this , too . and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up . i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix . bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified . i could write this movie . you could write this movie . many people have . many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again . other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it . more the fools we all . in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly , phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange . one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other . the same could be said about this movie . i have the sinking feeling we're going to see it again . soon . 
for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . in other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid . madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . she's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . what's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well . madonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . this movie leave no scummy stone unturned . ) anyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . how do we know this ? because his character is set up with the token wife and kids . how obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? and get kicked out of the house ? and get welcomed back anyway ? don't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs . don't ask . another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull . what's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes . the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . the thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor . and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? -- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in . the director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers . 
bad . bad . bad . that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls . if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? still haven't got the point ? other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . this movie stinks out loud . quite frankly , this movie deserves a . but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . so i'm giving it a . and maybe that is too generous . right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . so what is this movie about ? you ask . like it really matters . ok , here goes . this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . >from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of " hey man " , " dig " and my all time favorite -- " this is my happening , and it freaks me out " . now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . add to the directing and writing the music in this movie . i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . then we have the cast . first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks . if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you . meyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . proceed with extreme caution . 
while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell . todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . the next element in the film is the part when things go awry . and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world " is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . time passes . and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil . and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point . all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . and then there's martin sheen . whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape . spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . but bruce wayne had human elements to him . he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal . and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . none of this is present in spawn . the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's . as an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . children are not muppets . and spawn unapologetically targets children .
