what lessons ,  if any ,  do past social movements teach american citizens ?   is change feasible in today's society ?   howard zinn attempts to answer these two questions ,  along with a number of others ,  in his book entitled 'you can't be neutral on a moving train :  a personal history of our times . '  a beautifully written and inspirational book ,  'you can't be neutral on a moving train' is quintessential zinn-direct ,  yet optimistic .   zinn's central argument is that we are all capable of participating in change ,  however ,  for change to occur ,  we must all experience a social and political reawakening .   zinn's book offers the reader a more hopeful version of politics and society .   yet ,  such a version is only feasible if we ,  as americans ,  actively participate in the political process .   this involvement will fill ones soul with a sense of meaning ,  and in the end will create a better world for all to live in .   for those interested in the history of american society ,  politics ,  and social justice issues ,  'you can't be neutral on a moving train' is a marvelous book filled with inspiration

king did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one .   there were some areas that could have been condensed and were sometimes confusing .   for the most part ,  not bad .   would make a good movie
i use  " the notebook "  and  " a walk to remember "  as optional films in my upper division sociology courses .  after hearing many positive student responses ,  i was curious about sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels .   after a slow start with  " true believer ,  "  i was more satisfied with  " the rescue .  "   taylor's friendship with mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl ,  etc .  ,  etc .  ,
i checked this book out of our local library when i was teaching a unit on  " oceans "  to my preschool class .  the children listened closely as the suspense built in this story and the surprise ending was wonderful .  the children understood the food chain concept and have asked me several times to  " read it again !  "  it has also triggered a renewed interest in the children for using their own imaginations to create stories of their own creation .  i am ordering a copy for our own personal library .  this one is a keeper
this is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length .  i want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful ,  engaging and thought provoking story .this book packs the punch of great fiction .  it covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic .  you certainly don't need to be a history major ,  biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author .jared diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography ,  environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations .  i think the major shortcoming of his work is that he doesn't give enough credit to social factors and their role is history .if you don't know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture ,  the need for armies ,  etc .  you will find this fascinating reading .  if you have a deep knowledge of these areas ,  anthropology and sociology ,  you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying .  however ,  most likely you will enjoy the well-written story if you can keep in mind that it doesn't provide the full picture .in short ,  this book magnificently illuminates jared diamond's specific areas of interest ,  while downplaying or neglecting others .  it provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner .
still a great read ,  but not as good as tender at the bone and comfort me with apples .   foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol ,  but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom ,  dad and other relatives and friends .   the highs are not as high ,  nor the lows as low in garlic and sapphires .   reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader ;  that said ,  i hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book
this book brings together ,  pratical budget concerns with fashion ,  which are often in two totally different universes .  not worlds ,  universes .   in the fashionista there is everything from how to get wine out of a shirt to when to know if you should splurge on a coat .  in the worlds of increase american debt ,  this book should be on everyshelf in america !   it is light portable and she is extremely funny !   two thumbs up
there was not a single poem i didn't like ,  and most of them i loved .  her poems seem to touch upon the core of things .  i feel comfortable with saying i think she is in the same league as mary oliver ,  hafiz ,  stafford ,  and rumi .
pat was right !   anyone read the news lately ?   bush has succeeded only in creating more terrorists .   mission accomplished .   buchanan may have some whacky views about illegal aliens ,  but he knows his foreign policy when it comes to warfare and economics .   if he and ralph nader didn't dislike eachother so much they would no doubt make the best running mates this country has seen in half a century .
this book was not your usual biography ,  where it lulls at certain points ,  the entire book was an enjoyable read .   it covers his life from beginning to end and focuses on his character .
a work of art ,  makine's use of language is stunning .   not a quick read ,  i frequently had to stop and ponder many profound passages .   literature as an art form is not dead
i have just finished my sophomore year in college and in my first course relating to information and computer security we used this book .  i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting into the rapidly expanding field of infosec .as they say with the cissp certification ,  it is an  " inch deep and a mile wide "  .  this book covers many ,  many topics however it is really intended to be an introduction to these concepts .it gave me a good overview of information security concepts and prepared me for senior level infosec courses as well as preparation for graduate school .*note that preparation for the cissp exam would require much more then just this book
one of the most interesting books i've ever read !   i could not put this one down .   if all economics books were written this well ,  everyone would want to be an economist !   the author has a unique perspective on the analysis of data that is very compelling .   he will make you question every  " fact "  you've ever heard and observe the world around you from a different angle
i won't spoil the ending ,  but some many other reviewers didn't like the twist .   however ,  the reader who needs to have everything wrapped up and be 100% happy should read runaway jury .   however ,  like the firm  ( another great book )  that ends with the characters on the run and in trouble ,  this book has a very realistic ending that you didn't expect .   this was my favorite grisham book ,  followed by the firm ,  runaway jury ,  and pelican brief .   i found the broker to be too much of an italian lesson ,  the brethern simplistic ,  and the street lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people - with very little story holding it together .   if you like the firm you will like the partner
i have looked high and low through countless new age books and voyagers was the first book that really fofilled my sense of longing .  after every other book i had read ,  i found myself still searching ,  but after voyagers ,  i no longer needed to search .  that is not to say that everything you ever needed to know can be found in this book ,  it is more of an introduction to a larger body of work where you can find information on everything you wanted to know ,  and then some .  if you are genuinely looking for answers ,  then don't take my word for it ,  or any one else's for that matter .  .  .  just read it for yourself and decide for yourself if it is right for you .
with all the sensationalism and relentless obfuscation of the realities of life by the media i found this an exhillarating and thought provoking book .   there's more .  .  .  ,  but i'm sure you'll read and revisit this book again and again once it's prominently displayed on your bookshelf .   worth every penny .  .  .
naomi shihab nye is a bridge-builder .   she reaches out to those of other cultures ,  and always expresses understanding of those sometimes forgotten in our society .   a good book for all ages
this is the best rich dad book to date .   the book is filled with priceless information that 90% of people in the u . s .  ( particularly baby-boomers )  are clueless about today .most rich dad fans will know that kiyosaki's books tend to talk about the same general principles and don't touch on many new and groundbreaking concepts .   this book ,  however ,  is the exception .   i learned so many eye-opening things from this masterpiece .   it has truly changed my life and the way i look at money .   do yourself a favor and buy this book .
you know that guy down the street who acts awful snake-like ?   what about the cashier at walmart who is catty ?   and there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys .   neil gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize .    in this novel ,  gods  ( which represent animals )  roam the earth in the bodies of humans .   the main character is the clever ,  trouble-loving spider who interacts with other animal-gods in everyday human life .   this book ,  along with other science fiction books ,  has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination .the strong point of this novel is the humor employed by neil gaiman .   on par with douglas adams ,  the author of anasi boys fills the pages with quirky ,  pop-culture laden humor .   the main character ,  fat charlie ,  i found much in common with .   his awkward moments with friends ,  family and everyone else reveal a social insecurity that many are familiar with .   the story ,  however ,  isn't anything special .   i like witches and animal-gods as much as the next guy ,  but the plot is uninteresting .   it is a rare book that combines wit with plot ,  and this is not one of those rare books .
i enjoyed this book .  it focuses mainly on franklin's time abroad in england and france and gives an overview on who franklin was and how he interacted on the world stage during the revolutionary period .  i believe it's very accessible and would be a good starting place for anyone interested in franklin's life .  he's funny
as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction ,  however midway it turns into a romance novel .   i give it 3 stars for holding my attention .   a good beach read that can get you thinking  ( a little )  about a time past .   the one star is a mistake and i cannot seem to change it .    3 ***  stars
when i read ron penton's first book ,  data structures for game programming ,  i couldn't wait to see what he did next .  mud game programming lived up to all of my expectations ,  and indeed surpassed them .the author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable -- and ,  equally important ,  making them interesting .  reading mud game programming is like having a friendly ,  cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade .  instead of just telling you what to do ,  he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a mud server ,  enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project ,  which might not be the same .  you end up with not just knowledge but understanding .i highly recommend mud game programming to people doing any type of network-based multiplayer programming ,  not just traditional muds .  i'd give this book six stars if they'd let me
this was the first book by johnson i read ,  though my mentors and teachers spoke of him often .  the information about the mandorla was particularly helpful ,  giving a visual and archetypical model for holding the energy of the apparently opposite forces in a space of new possibility .johnson writes that if i can be with the opposites ,  at the point of their intersection and stay with my conflicting thoughts and impulses long enough ,  the two will teach each other something and produce an insight that serves both .  .  .  produce something utterly new instead of win ,  lose or compromise .the key appears to be that every real solution has to grow from the unique situation i face .  formulas ,  how-to's ,  devices and processes can never be enough in such moments .  referring to my own past for an experiential reference or to another's experience or advice can't do it ,  either ,  because it prevents or sidetracks the point of unlimited potential that wants to appear in and emerge out of each unique encounter .i liked what maria had to say in her post :   " meet your shadow "  ,  dated november 22 ,  2003 .  she said she gave it only 4 stars because he doesn't tell how to do that is described as possible in the book .  .  .  i felt a little of that ,  too .  and i have since appreciated the blessing of not being told how until i've done a bit of my own struggle with my own opposites in many life situations .a book i found to be a perfect companion to this one is  " i of the storm - embracing conflict ,  creating peace "  ,  by gary simmons .  i highly recommend it in addition to this book .  it addresses some of the questions i felt about the nature of conflict after finishing owning your own shadow ,  in a way that shed light into my life .  i am very appreciative of both books .
don't get me wrong ,  this was an enjoyable read .   since retiring matthew hope i guess em had an urge to return to sw florida with this tale .   funny adult repartee and a good &quot ; mystery&quot ;  but only age 9-12 reading level according to the amazon rating ?  ?   these latest books from mcbain are all very similar and are being churned out at almost a tv-episode rate ,  but how about trying to stretch a bit
i use this book and/or refer someone to it almost every day in my line of work .  i highly recommend it to anyone who works with color
in her latest book ,  tracey wood demystifies the process of teaching kids to read .as parents ,  we've all been told that reading is critical to a child's success in school ,  in a future career and for pleasure and enrichment throughout a lifetime .   we feel a great deal of pressure to help our children achieve this important skill ,  but typically don't know how to go about it .tracey presents a refreshingly straightforward ,  step-by-step approach to teaching reading skills .   the book is chock-full of word lists ,  fun activities ,  games ,  and creative ideas to engage a child's interest and get him reading .   there are helpful book recommendations for readers of all levels  ( including parents !  )  and pointers on spotting reading problems early ,  with practical suggestions for getting help .   the book is spiced with humorous anecdotes parents can truly appreciate .   tracey's compassion and commonsense shine through and take the stress out of teaching kids to read .i highly recommend this book to parents of beginning readers .
i have read almost all of greg bear's books and loved eon and eternity as well as the forge of god  and anvil of stars .  i found legacy a little disappointing compared to eon and eternity ,  which preceded them .  the  narrative spends a lot of time on the human interactions of the characters ,   and not much time on the technological concepts of the  flaw and gate  openers ,  which i missed .  i did finish this book and at times was quite  spellbound by it .  not mr .  bear's best work ,  but a must-read if you have  read eon and eternity
joe pickett's daily life is not as enjoyable as it once was .   his wife now has a successful business and brings home a lot more money than he does ,  and there's still the temptations both of them thought about while joe was away at jackson hanging over their marriage .   his relationship with his fast growing up daughter sheridan is not what it once was and his new boss is doing everything he can to make joe's life a misery .   throw in a civil war between saddlestring's largest family and the appearance of ,  after along term behind bars bloodthirsty j .  w .  keeley ,  who will not stop at anything until he has avenged his daughter's  ( joe's stepdaughter's )  death through the slow and torturous murder of joe pickett ,  and one way or another the era of saddlestring's game warden is set to end .c . j .  box's joe pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel .   the initial open season was a surreal not quite but almost carl hiaasen type novel ,  then savage run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure .   trophy hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and as many ,  i was glad when out of range returned this series to the traditional believable realistic type thriller ,  a style which continues with in plain sight .i would strongly suggest reading these books in order ,  starting with open season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and in plain sight is certainly no exception to that .   it will be interesting to see if c . j .  box continues with the characters of this series in some form or another or if his next book will be a totally different kind of adventure .
if you wish to improve the quality of your software development ,  this book is worth reading ,  studying ,  and questioning .   it realy does not tell you how or why to improve ,  but suggest processes and measures that you need to  concider if you are already commited to better software
hi .  .  i would say most people should run ,  not walk ,  to buy this book .  it doesn't matter where you are starting from ,  everyone can benefit from this stuff ,  and there are a variety of ways to compile wealth that the authors talk about .  i found it to be very inspiring and well worth the money .  i would recommend it to all my friends ,  especially those who are befuddled by the markets ,  because it has simple straightforward advice .  good luck to all the savers and investors among us !  for socially conscious people ,  they also tell how to help society  ( as well as get wealthy .
charlie bone isn't your typical nine-year-old boy .   although he didn't know that himself .   but when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him ,  he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever .   tracking down the picture ,  charlie finds out it belongs to miss ingledew ,  a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years .   she gives charlie a mysterious package  ( that he can't open )  and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world .   as it turns out ,  charlie is one of the descendants of the red king ,  a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding .   the red king's children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since .   at bloor's academy ,  charlie finds friends and enemies ,  and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others don't want revealed .jenny nimmo is the author of five books in the charlie bone series and has written several other children's books and fantasies .many people compare charlie bone to harry potter ,  and that's a good comparison .   but the two series are different .   harry's family is really non-supportive ,  but charlie has a loving mother ,  a doting grandmother ,  and uncle paton ,  who turns out to be something of a hero .   the book is a fun ,  fast-paced whirlwind of mysteries ,  magic ,  and friendship .   even at 400 pages ,  it feels like it's over much too soon .there are a few jarring instances where the point-of-view was disconnected ,  moving from one character and one scene into another without warning .   they were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story ,  but noticeable all the same .fans who are waiting for the next harry potter book who haven't tried the charlie bone series are encouraged to do so .   charlie's story ,  although similar ,  has much to offer in reading excitement
in plain sight offers an exceedingly thin plot and thin characters ,  but it is still an enjoyable read owin entirely to author c .  j .  box's prowess at telling a story .saddlestring ,  wyoming is enjoying the dawning of spring and ,  unsuprisingly for a police procedural ,  a possible murder .opal scarlett ,  the grand and really mean old lady of thunderhead ranches ,  has disappeared and perhaps has been the victim of foul play .  tom wayman ,  an alcoholic fishing guide ,  is brought in as a suspect .  opal ,  in violation of the law ,  charged wayman and other boaters a fee for navigating the river that runs  through her land .  she strung up razor wire across the river and the lazy sheriff thinks a drunken wayman killed her when he tossed her into the river .  frankly ,  there's not a lot of excitement here .joe pickett ,  wyoming game warden ,  is dealing with a problematic new boss and his 14 year old daughter ,  sheridan .  sheridan just happens to be the best friend of jule scarlett ,  daughter of hank scarlett ,  one of two brothers who might be heir to the big ranch .  of course ,  they can't find a will and the two brothers are smashing each other with shovels when joe arrives to drop off julie .  julie ,  it turns out ,  doesn't live with her father hank .  no ,  she lives with opal's eldest son ,  arlen ,  on his  " side "  of the ranch .  there's a third brother ,  wyatt ,  who is a bit on the weird side .  the very weird side .enter j .  w .  keely ,  a good old boy ,  who is on the run from mississippi where he has murdered a couple .  on his way to wyoming to settle a personal vendetta against joe pickett ,  keely murders a prisoner and then guns down a cowboy who did nothing more than get keely angry .  again ,  not much here .  keely is not a convincing bad guy ;  more like a typed out description of a  " bad "  guy .under the name of bill monroe  ( which author box reminds us several times is also the name of a famous country and western musician )  goes to work for both of the arlen brothers .golly gee :  several nasty things happen at the pickett household .  oh my ,  the fbi keeps inquiring into the whereabouts of  nate romanski  ( or something close to that spelling )  who apparently figured largely in a previous novel .  all this produces tension in the pickett household ,  high job stress ,  arguments with best friends .  yawn .  just not a lot of excitement here either .finally comes the climax .  rain .  thunder .  floods .  pickett's daughers kidnapped !  the truth comes out !  box tries for a surprise ending ,  but it's kind of like a wet firecracker .all that said ,   " in plain sight "  is still an enjoyable ,  if not particularly suspenseful ,  read .  he has a strong writing style and does a nice job of weaving in a feel for wyoming's people that is ,  in my opinion ,  stronger than the underlying story .  this is the sixth of the joe pickett novels .  i won't be going out of my way to read the older ones ,  but i will keep an eye out for anything new by box .  he's definitely a comer even if he hasn't arrived .jerr
have read the whole leaphorn/chee series by tony hillerman .  this is one of the better ones - the subject is topical and the characters take on more definition .  the overall  " feel "  is that this time ,  the subject is of a more personal nature to tony hillerman ?  a good read
not great ,  maybe ,  but good .the theme is vampire - the creatures that feed by night on their human cattle .  but what if the night goes on and on ?good suspense ,  good characters and development ,  and an artistic style that carries the mood .  it's a nightmarish visual style and a limited palette  ( black ,  white ,  and blood red )  ,  but it works .  recommended .//wiredweir
nora's  " in the garden "  trilogy was great ,  but i must say not her best .   her characters are so life-like and you actually feel like you're part of the story .   she's a phenomenal author and i have not come across anything of hers that i have not thoroughly enjoyed .i also highly recommend  " the three sisters island trilogy .  "   by far my favorite .happy reading !
i was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and i found it surprisingly helpful .   by filling out a basic personality inventory ,  this book will tell you what &quot ; style&quot ;  of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other &quot ; styles . &quot ;   i see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday .   but i can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment .   if you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior ,  this book gives you the skills to build great relationships .   i agree ,  however ,  with the previous reviewer's comments that this book does not go very deep ,  thus only 4 stars .  do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this ,  but you can make your day-to-day dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics .    ( this is also an easy read .  .  .  took me 2 days !
one reviewer of this book said he's sick of investing tomes ,  they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors ,  who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients .and of course those firms charge hefty fees ,  even if their timing is slightly off  ( say ,  a few years or so )  .another reviewer loved the book because he realizes he is going to have to work harder to invest successfully over coming years .  if only he had read the book in 1999 .what is not fully understood by many investors is that the money game is run by wall streeters with whom you cannot compete and beat over time .  some of the smartest people in the world work on the street and they are not sharing what they know with anybody .  but they want you in the game .  they need you .  they take care of their biggest clients  ( and i mean really big )  and every client who is not big is late to the table and last to leave ,  usually at a loss .  because smaller clients start buying what the big players are just starting to sell .  which is why the big holders sell in dribs and drabs over time .  every winning trade requires a losing trade .  too bad ,  past results are no etc .  etc .try to work the market independently against the big guns and you will eventually come to know the meaning of whipsaw .  and its consequences .  everybody thinks they can get out in time .  trouble is ,  when markets tank--stock market ,  real estate markets--there is no getting out because there are no buyers .  it's a free fall without a parachute .  many real estate speculators will learn this in the coming year .the author of this book ,  ed eastering ,  is well respected and can give you a good view of how the game works .  which is useful in a textbook kind of way .  and he attempts to lay out some tips for the solo investor .trouble is ,  timing is everything and the information you need to time the market is not going to be found in any book .  or any proprietary system being peddled over the internet .  if it worked that well they would not be selling it to you .so what's the answer ?contrarian investing ?  when everybody is long ,  go short ,  and vice versa ?  good idea but it requires a discipline that can tear apart the innards of a veteran wall street trader .  it is just not wired into the systems of most people to pull it off .  and reliable sell signals are about as hard to find as a legitimate 1918 inverted jenny .another possibility :  do what most of the really rich usually do ,  stuff it into long-term u . s .  treasuries that pay a fixed interest rate and guarantee the principal at maturity .  of course ,  you have to keep them for the long term ,  which the really rich can afford to do .  can you ?  if not ,  you may sell the bond at a loss that negates the interest you were paid .  so you're stuck with safe u . s .  short-term notes which mature at par and pay the promised  ( usually much lower )  interest rate .  not very exciting .and if inflation pops your interest rate may give you breakeven or less .  well ,  that's tough unless you had the cojones to buy one of the most volatile commodities in existence :  gold .  this is a truly ferocious trap that has ruined many .the big guns say don't speculate with money you can't afford to lose .  hey ,  thanks .  that fits about  . 001 percent of the investing population .read easterling for the historical big picture .  and it ain't a pretty picture .  it's all about volatility and volatility is a killer .and so the moral of the story may be to be very careful with your investment decisions .  err on the side of caution .  the first consideration of the physician is do no harm .  the first consideration of the financial investor is lose not thy wad .of couse there is the notion that markets investing is really just another excuse to excerise the gambling urge for people who consider casinos crass .  if that's you ,  may luck truly be with you .
my husband bought this book for me and i have to say it is not a book i would normally pick up .  i also have to say .  .  . i loved it !  it was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way .  i enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer
great gift from grandmother .  children love this book .  it's a great book for anybody learning the english language .  every class should have this book .  this is a gift that everybody appreciates .   get the book down for the child to look at and learn .  great teaching tool !   exceptional pictures !  i always buy two--one for the new grandchild ,  and a copy goes to the school ,  when they start school .   you have my vote for the very best
you know the author is good when he can make you tear up for a former kkk member on death row .  while the book was a little slow at times ,  i couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happens next .  if you like john grisham ,  you'll like this book .
i was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here .   even more stunned by the criticisms .   this is not a scientific treatise ,  and never pretends to be .   this is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of emergence ,  nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper .this is an interesting ,  graspable ,  exciting and intelligently written book about a phenomenon which is absolutely ,  positively crucial to understand .   to some people emergence is a particular abstract in a particular field - those people were disappointed and found this  " light reading "  - which is really too bad ,  because they are the ones who need this book the most .   alas ,  we can expect it to be a while before these  " scientist "  can look outside their own shallow mud-puddles of their over-specialties to see how applicable emergent theory is to the world we are immersed in ,  both natural and man-made .if you didn't find this book exciting ,  you didn't read it .   sit down and read it without distraction and prejudice .   let johnson do what he does best ;  take you on a journey of ideas and concepts .   sure ,  some of it is simplified for the lay-reader ,  but anybody who isn't a total couch-potato is going to find the content interesting enough to set-out and search for details on their own .   it isn't johnson's goal to elaborate on some trivial and fragmentary specialty that only people with masters degrees and secured positions in academia could possibly enjoy or tolerate .his goal is to show what emergence is and why it is so important ,  how vast the concepts are in their potential application in every imaginable field ,  and how elegant ,  simple ,  complex ,  chaotic ,  and beautiful emergence is  !and he does exactly this quite well .   if you read this book and are not excited ,  you didn't get it .   read it again .   and again .   look up the examples of emergence ,  and try to actually find your own examples of emergence in your world ,  in your daily experience .   the enrichment you'll gain from it will be worth a lot more than any silly over-specialty in an obscure field of research that nobody has ever hear
i just finished the book last night ,  crying as i read the last few pages .   i guess since carole radziwill and i are the same age and share a lot of the same interests helped capture me into this memoir and unable to put it down .   it also gives you some unheard stories of the famous family .   i felt like i knew carolyn bessette kennedy better through this story rather than the tabloid press .   she was a delightful and woman ,  filled with life ,  which makes her ending even more tragic .   the book honors a beautiful friendship and a marriage tested by cancer .   it pays homage to anthony radizwill as well as john and carolyn kennendy as it lets you see them as real people rather than tabloid  fodde
my sister ,  whom moved out and had never cooked a thing in her life ,  really enjoyed the benefits from this book !  the moment she saw it on my shelf ,  she snatched it up and took it home and i haven't seen it since .  i hear she's cooking some great meals and hope she'll invite me over for dinner sometime soon !   ;
if one approaches this book with a view to learning music theory ,  one would be slightly disappointed .   the author brushes right through the fundamentals but that is to be expected from an outline book of this type .    all in all ,  i think this book will come in useful after i've learned music  and need to review theory from time to time .   great book though
this book was stunning - i was enraptured with the writing and loved the story .  so many emotions in one book .  looking forward to reading more from this author
in the last few decades historians --following sociologists such as durkheim-- have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people's experience of space and time .   schivelbusch's small piece is a pretty good  ( but light-weight )  example of  this genre .  he reveals some interesting trivia along the way :  he tells ,  for  example ,  how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of  first-class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed ;  he  shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting  social values of europe and america .  but he is at his most interesting when  describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of  geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations .   furthermore ,  by creating the need for standardized time-tables ,  railways  nurtured a standardized/homogenized conception of time .  local  idiocyncracies became less important .  doubtless true national identities  could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and  communications .  a book that takes these ideas much further is stephen  kern's excellent work &quot ; the culture of time and space . &quot ;  if this  genre interests you ,  kern's book is an important read
i love this book !   i love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last  ( i say maybe because originally buddies was supposed to be the last )  .   it is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested .   my love for dennis savage's irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with little kiwi .   my love for little kiwi's innocence becomes concern for his actions .   it's like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result ,  the choices that they make are theirs ,  and there's nothing you can do about it ,  but let them be chosen .   it's hard letting little kiwi grow up and become virgil brown .   i imagine it's the same way with a child ,  but at least then you get to see what happens !   mind you ,  the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle ,  feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next .   but just like &quot ; just above my head&quot ;  by james baldwin  ( which i highly recommend )  ,  i have been unable to pick up this book and read it again .   it simply leaves me realing with so many feelings ,  yet i would not trade the experience reading it with anything .   how does one mix merriment with malaise so well ?   read the book and find out
jane hirshfield and mariko aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka-- manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity .  i had a friend who was a japanese scholar ,  who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka .  i have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well .  hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called  " on japanese poetry and the process of translation "  .  i recommend it highly ,  even if you do not normally read this kind of essay .i am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on ono no komachi and izumi shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry .  shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and ono no komachi was one of the rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early heian period .  the reason that i am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself .these poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship .  they are strong and sad and very affecting .  there is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves ,  so i will close this review with one of the poems by shikibu :what is the useof cherishing life in spring ?its flowersonly shackle usto this world
one of the few roald dahl books i read ,  it remains one of my favorites from childhood .   i saw the movie too ,  and the movie is very funny ,  and i felt it did the book justice .matilda is about a precocious little girl named matilda who has a crazy family  ( who doesn't support her at all and certainly doesn't respect her intelligence )  .   at a very young age ,  she is able to read very advanced books and she wins the admiration of her new teacher mrs .  honey .   the only problem is her dim parents and the evil mrs .  trunchbull who rules the school with an iron fist .   and then there's matilda's new found super powers .it's very funny ,  the predicaments matilda gets into and the things mrs .  trunchbull says ,  even if she is cruel .   it might be a little scary to very young children ,  but it depends on the child
in the month that i have been puting the teaching into practice , i have felt better like i haven't felt in eleven years .  my weight is going down and my energy is increasing .  i am getting a lot of compliments ,  and someone told me i look more like 31 than 51 which is my real age
i just finished reading this book and loved it .  it helps put things into perspective .  i would recommend it to anyone who is going through trials in their life .  it's on my all time favorite books list ,  i just bought a copy for my mother-in-law and am encouraging many of my friends to read it
_the new taste of chocolate_ has the beautiful pictures of a coffee table book ,  but it has a lot of academic substance and a lot of value to the reader .the main chapters are :- growing up with cacao- a natural and cultural history of chocolate- from cacao to chocolate- identifying cacao- tasting chocolate- recipesthere is also a glossary ,  and a list of companies to order fine chocolate from .for a beginner like myself ,  who loved chocolate but hadn't progressed much beyond hershey's with almonds when i read the book ,  _the new taste of chocolate_ was very educational .   it explained the path from cacao bean to chocolate bar ,  and it also explained the difference between dark chocolate ,  milk chocolate and white chocolate .   it explained how cocoa powder comes from chocolate ,  why chocolate is so difficult to make candy with if you don't know what you're doing ,  and why fancier recipes will sometimes specify chocolate manufacturer and cacao percentage .it was also quite interesting to read about the guidelines for tasting chocolate .   the discussion about criollo ,  forastero ,  and trinitario cacao plants was very fascinating from a scientific standpoint .   i later found that what is true for cacao trees is true for many other types of plants  ( including wheat )  :  the plants that make the tastiest & highest quality edible parts are also the least productive and most delicate ,  so growers & breeders have to choose whether to grow something that will almost certainly produce a less-desired but still profitable crop ,  or to grow something that has an uncertain yield but is highly profitable should the plant actually produce anything .the recipes were also interesting .   after reading this book ,  i became more adventurous in my chocolate-tasting and started trying some of the european imports i see in the local grocery stores .   my only regret is i am now knowledgeable enough and my tastes are spoiled enough that m&ms and hersheys with almonds seem pretty bland
the challenge/solution style of these books are great for security beginners as well as seasoned professionals .   if you read carefully you can pick up many hints/tools which you can use in real life security scenarios .my only -ve comment about this book is its getting out of date now .   many of the incidents described are not relevant now ,  as security practices at most firms would thrawt these incidents .   having said that ,  the scenarios are still good for security beginners .   for advanced readers i would suggest the second edition or the soon to be released third edition
dr .  gray must be a wonderful lover .   as a woman i read his hints and suggestions for a man's love making technique and marvel at his insight .   i truly could not have imagined a man so aware of what a woman really wants in the bedroom .    however there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover .   by maintaining a position of gallant  " ladies first "  mentality he ,  in truth ,  is demeaning the power of women's sexuality .there is much to be gained by men reading this book .   attitudes can improve ,  skill levels can rise and even the articulation of loving feelings can be created and/or grow with the help of this book's suggestions .  women are unfortunately reduced to being receipients of ,  not participants in ,  in bedroom activity
&quot ; stengel :  his life and times&quot ;  is no mere biography .   it is a chronicle ,  not only of the earlier days of baseball ,  but of america itself .   as a biography ,  it is superlative .   as a history book ,  it stands on it's own merits
period
this book is hysterical !check out the video  ( above )  of the housewife slapping her husband's butt with a spoonwhile she's got him bent over the kitchen counter !  !  !  !  !  !funny
we have enjoyed another of eric carle's books--brown bear brown bear what do you see--since my son was a few weeks old .   so ,  when my son was about 7 months old ,  i bought from head to toe .   it was a wonderful purchase !   after a few reads ,  my son was imitating the animals just like his mama--waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat .   it was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books i read to him .
if you wanna stop smoking then give this a go .  you'll either stop right away or you'll never beleive your doomed to puff on for life  .  either way you win .  strange thing to say about a book but true i say .  amazing stuff .
a fraudulent marine biologist ,  whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the florida everglades ,  tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship .   unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him .it's a wonderfully comic page-turner ,  although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious .  a few ends are left loose .  it challenged comparison with the florida novels of elmore leonard ,  such as  " maximum bob "  and  " stick "  but it does not quite live up to the master .  some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky floridians with stolid upper midwesterners seemed to derive from david barry  ( and euripides ,  ovid and tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick )  .i thought this was his best since  " striptease .  "  the intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and  ( although i'm a tree-hugging whale- lover myself )  overloaded with environmentalist politics .   incidentally ,  isn't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no ?
he is a nightwalker ,  a navaho vampire who because he is only half nosferatu has the strength not to succumb to the allure of the dark side of his nature .   he is a new mexico state police officer who is often teamed up with beautiful fbi agent diane lopez who not only knows what lee nez is but accepts him for his good heart .   right now they are trying to infiltrate a smuggling ring made up of skinwalkers  ( navaho witches )  who can shape shift at night and still retain their ability to think like a human .these smugglers known as the silver eagles go to mexico in animal form ,  meet with their suppliers ,  and return with silver and turquoise for jewelry suppliers who get their products at black market prices .   the two cops seek to arrest humans who are part of the smuggling ring and kill the shapeshifters so they no longer can carry out their evil plans .   while diane and lee stalk the silver eagles ,  they are hunted by a vampire who wants to kill them because they murdered her nest including her husband and brother .   they remain on guard at all times because beside each other they don't know who they can trust .once again the thurlos provide readers their interpretation of the vampire mythos unique to the navaho culture .   lee can stay in sunlight provided he uses sun block while his speed ,  strength and night vision make him a better police officer .   in the thurlos world ,  skinwalkers are evil creatures who must be killed ;  a variation on the hapless victim werewolf legend .   blood retribution is a fantastic horror mystery thriller that readers of these genres will want to read .harriet klausner
i love to browse through different cookbooks .   i have quite a collection ,  and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before i decide to purchase the entire book .   i normally look for 3 things in a cookbook ,  besides delicious recipes that will work for my family .   this includes :1 )   pictures of more than 3/4 of the recipes  ( color pictures are the best )2 )   a spiral binding ,  or at least one that easily lays flat3 )   new & innovative recipes that have ingredients i can easily find at a grocery storei also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium ,  fat content ,  protein ,  fiber ,  and carbohydrates .i picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal in-between working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events .   let's face it ,  eating out isn't always the best for you ,  especially since you cannot always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting .   i wanted some new recipes to try ,  but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying  " what is it ?  "  .   i was not disappointed .the book offered many beautiful color photographs ,  and the pages themselves were glossy and thick .  .  . not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use .   all of the nutrient information was included ,  along with a column called  " nutrient bonus "  that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of vitamin c ,  calcium ,  etc .   the book was hard cover ,  but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat ,  another good bonus so that i was not always struggling to keep my page open .   it also contains a rather large vegetarian section .some of our favorites include :  seafood salad with citrus vinaigrette ,  bistro beef salad ,  vietnamese style beef & noodle broth ,  mock risotto ,  chicken stuffed with golden onions & fontina ,  almond crusted chicken fingers ,  beer-battered tilapia with mango salsa ,  and loaded twice baked potatoes .   enjoy !
i received my first copy of this cute album as a gift when i had my first baby .   i had so much fun putting it together that i tracked it down for my second and now for my third .   telling the story from baby's point of view is fun and gets mom thinking about how baby would really feel about all the firsts in his/her life .   it is an easy album for moms and dads who want to record all the important events that the first year brings ,  but who haven't joined the scrapbooking craze quite yet .   i love this album and plan to have one for each child
a team of highly respected scientists is recruited and sent on the most exciting mission of their careers - they are to explore and catalog an expansive system of tunnels and caves deep below the earth's surface in antarctica .   they set off on their adventure only to learn that a team ,  like themselves ,  was sent on this same mission only 3 months prior and has never been heard from again .   they also learn that what makes this set of caverns so exciting and sought after is that they contain diamonds larger and more plentiful than any mankind has ever seen .   wealth of this sort has attracted both dedicated scientists and individuals with more menacing plans in mind .   but these dangers are nothing compared to the beasts that are native to this subterranean world who are numerous and life threatening to the mission and the team .james rollins' debut novel sets the stage for what has become his successful career writing scientific thrillers .   he does a wonderful job of incorporating biology ,  archeology ,  geology ,  and other various earth sciences into an exciting and page turning novel .   some of his subsequent novels are stronger than this first work ,  but subterranean does not disappoint and definitively sets the stage for his many books to come .
this is a book about beauty ,  passion ,  a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts ,  especially music ,  craves and feels ,  the fire that burns within .  a book that dares to take one ,  if one dares to take that step ,  on a journey deep into the bare souls of it's characters .  the story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot ,  or develops into dramatic changes for the characters .  that is not what the author wanted to convey ,  and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity ,  and not expect the characters to travel actively without .  the book gives us these people ,  the town ,  the surroundings .  it brings us deep into the realities ,  the thoughts ,  the complexities of the human soul .  the people are good ,  bad ,  ugly ,  beautiful ,  selfish ,  depressed ,  found ,  or lost .  but from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in mick kelly's soul ,  and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town ,  then the author reveals her own soul with her words ,  for those that pick up on what her words show .  i am still amazed at the power this book has .  any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book ,  should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous .for me ,  this book will always be the book that made me capable of understanding how a writer weaves words together with her soul
this one i read before i started leaving my reviews on amazon .  it's a wonderful story .  you'll love the characters .  absolutely a 5 star read
i originally bought this title when it came out as a four-part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection .kingdome come is an elseworlds  ( what if )  story set approximately ten years after the retirement of superman and subsequently nearly every other super hero .  as the story unfolds ,  the reason superman quit is revealed .  a rival hero named magog killed the joker and was put on trial for murder .  when the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted ,  superman quit in disgust .  the results of the public choosing a hero that would kill are very apparent in the future .the children of the super heroes we know are everywhere .  they hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each other in the way they see fit ,  destroying property and causing chaos .  wonder woman approaches superman in his self-imposed exile in the nuclear wastleland that is kansas and asks him to return and lead the former heroes in returning order .when superman returns to the public eye in issue #2 ,  it sets into motion an apocalypse as described in the bible ,  but with superheroes being the catalyst .  the new justice league rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by mister miracle ( the world's greatest escape artist )  called the gulag .  all this is shown from the viewpoint of norman mccray ,  a disillusioned pastor and friend of the golden age sandman .  he is led on his journey by the spectre  ( dc's angel of death )i absolutely love this story by mark waid ,  the way he wraps comic characters and events into a biblical epic is brilliant .  the painted art by alex ross is jaw-dropping in it's realism .  the re-imagined characters are god-like in their depiction ,  especially the flash- a red blur wrapped in lightning wearing a winged greek helmet .issue #3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the gulag .  as superman races to the scene ,  he is thrown to the ground by the only person that could ,  captain marvel .  i still remember waiting for issue #4 to come out .the fight scene between captain marvel and superman was voted #1 all-time by wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone .  even  without this fight scene ,  i would rate this as one of the ten greatest mini-series ever ,  but with it kingdom come is #1 .the only possible negative to this series is that you have to already know something about comics to fully appreciate all the subtleties waid and ross weave into this story .  nearly every dc character is pictured at least once .  ( a geek's paradise i guess )  after reading this i actually liked captain marvel ,  who i had always seen as an even cheesier version of superman .  the fear the other heroes have of him and his power level make him hard to laugh at ,  despite jerry ordway's power of shazam monthly series to the contrary .i hope my description of the story has led any undecided mind to pick this up .  fabulous art and incredible writing .   ( this should be 5 stars ,  but i can't seem to edit my rating
peter watson ,  holding a number of research degrees ,  offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the 20th century in this book .   not being an easy read ,  it takes some time to get through .the main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the 20th century in its economic and social context .   this is quite an achievement ,  considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics .watson tends to cover science the best ,  and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of 20th century science ,  including the theories of relativity ,  quantum mechanics ,  scientific cosmology ,  evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene .   however ,  the book falls down in some parts where it covers philosophy .   watson dismisses husserl's phenomenology as 'abstract' and of little importance ,  when in fact phenomenology was probably the most important philosophical school in the 20th century along with analytical philosophy ,  founded by russell and wittgeinstein ,  and attracted so many leading european minds to philosophy in a time when science was at its zenith of glory .overall though ,  watson's work is a very important attempt to see where we are in what we know ,  and where we are going .
&quot ; good sports&quot ;  is a book which helps girls to be the &quot ; best athlete you can be . &quot ;  it catagorizes players ,  parents ,  and other important people into real-life situations .  it has quizes ,  quotes from  other athletes ,  and memory pages .  also ,  it offers a lot of web sites and  other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports .  more  importantly ,  this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is  all about .  one of my favorite parts in the book says :  &quot ; sometimes heart  is the strongest muscle . &quot ;  this book also tells girls how to take good  care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete .  it  includes the food pyramid and what one serving is .  &quot ; good sports&quot ;   involves &quot ; power drills&quot ;  and advice from other girls .  it goes  inside the lives of other athletes ,  such as michelle kwan ,  but also shows  girls'lives who are teens or pre-teens .   this book not only focuses on the  physical parts of playing a game ,  but on the mental part as well :  keeping  your dreams alive even when you're at the bottom of the team ,  or you were  embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped .  i would reccommend  &quot ; good sports&quot ;  to any female athelete ,  whether you are experienced  or haven't even started yet .  it teaches you the basics and also the mental  parts of a game !  it has advice on keeping your mind and body strong ,  along  with being a good winner and loser .  it has advice from other athletes ,   famous or otherwise ,  memory pages to record your victories ,  dreams and  goals ,  and ways to reach sports associations .  as the book says ,  it includes  &quot ; winning .  losing .  and everything in between . &quot
an excellent ,  well explained art book ,  with beautiful and easy to follow illustrations .  the book is a treasure chest of ideas suitable for the primary classroom .  this book provides plenty of opportunities to explore the various strands of the visual arts field .  a great resource for any teacher ,  parent or doting aunt
anything by dave barry is genius - full of insight ,  uncannily funny ,  entertaining ,  and thought provoking .   dave barry turns 50 makes a perfect small gift for 50th birthdays  ( as does dave barry turns 40 for those a decade younger .
as a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text  " mechanism and theory in organic chemistry "  by lowry and richardson ,  this book by anslyn and dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student .   i agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging ,  the text is clearly written ,  and the material relates well back to current research issues .  if you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program ,  get this book before you try  " advanced organic chemistry :  structure and mechanisms "  by carey and sundberg .  i expect that  " modern physcial organic chemistry "  will become a staple to most chemist's shelves similar to that of a crc handbook or  " advanced organic chemistry "  by march .
this book was originally conceived of and designed in the manner of an illuminated manuscript .   the images are combined with the text to convey meaning .   in the paperback most of the images are gone and the ones remaining are converted to black and white and shoved into the middle of the book where they lose their context
very few books can weave the historical narrative with an account of the subject as mr . derbyshire does it in this book . whats more ,  he does total justice to the subject by making sure persons who should get their credit does atleast so .  the author's canvas is huge and he almost reminded me of how much i missed undergraduate math .a must read for students of algebra as this one sets a context which is far brilliant than the dry subject textbook  ( i myself taught a class in algebra aat university of new orleans
finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty !  yunnus has proven ,  by the success of his bank's loans to the desperately poor ,  that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support .  founder of the grameen bank ,  he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world  ( including the us and canada )  have shown that lending to the poor ,  helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried .  yunnus' book is inspiring and an eye-opener .  it made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations cannot bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help .  it's hard to separate the book from the idea .  one is as fascinating as the other .  out of 5 points ,  i give it a six
i read this book and could not put it down .  mr moyers will change the way of thinking for many as this disease has no limitations on the age in which this disease affects someone and all those around them .  this book has insight and  boundless wisdom for all generations involved .  i would recommend all colleges make it madatory reading ,  and only wish somehow every adult knew it was available .
i started the book last night ,  and couldn't put it down until 4 am ,  but at least i finished it !  it was a good storyline ,  i enjoyed getting a simple  glimpse into the media world .   it also gives you a good peek into the  corruption behind campaigns and politics in general .  i really liked the  characters in this book ,  although each one ,  in my opinion ,  could have used  some more depth .    the only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because  as you read it - you start to feel that the second half of the book  &lt ; with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book&gt ;  was completely  rushed .   i really don't like a sudden closing to a book .  however ,  it really  does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages .   i just feel that it  could have had more of an impact ,  and more of that &quot ; umph&quot ;  had the  story been written at the same speed throughout .  i do recommend this book  for anyone who just wants a good book to read .   if you're looking for  something you will remember for life - this isn't going to be it .   but if  you're looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon - - - by all  means ,  try reading mary jane clark's &quot ; do you .  .  . etc . &quot ;    final  word :  i believe her mother-in-law ,  the other clark ,  would be quite proud of  her ex-daughter in law .   the woman can write .   however ,  given her talents ,   i wish she would learn to write in her own style ,  instead of in the  familiar style of the other clark
this book is a big hit with my pre-k class !  i was pleasantly surprised at how responsive and attentive they were while i was reading this .  they have memorized most of the book .  they all loved it !  an excellent resource for teaching about diversity and various cultures !  i'd definitely recommend reading this book to/with ages four through maybe second grade
everyone should follow the advise published on the outside cover of this book .  .  .  " you live in this world ,  you use oil ,  you must read this book .
'a little history of the world' is exactly what the title indicates .  gombrich takes the reader from the dawn of time to the mid-twentieth century .  gombrich covers cave men ,  great religious leaders ,  philosophers ,  and events over an incredible timeline .i got this book for my eight year old son and i to read together .  there were certain chapters and topics which grapped his attention .  other chapters were a little over his head in regards to understanding the causes for certain events .  in particular ,  the chapters covering the inquisition and the causes that lead to the french revolution were a little difficult for him to truely understand .this book is a great way to introduce a child to the wonderful stories that make up the world we live in .  it may also be a stepping stone to further reading on subjects that spark some interest
i purchased this book to find out about the publishing industry and more effectively market my book .   without mr .  kremer's book i would have been clueless ,  however now i am well informed and continue to sell my book .   it has been picked up for a second edition by another publisher ,  which was my main goal .    (  i self published as a quick way to get review copies out to the public and get the book rolling ) i knew the world needed my book and i needed it releasedquick .   mission accomplished .   i keep 001 ways close to my side and continuously consult it as i continue my publishing journey .   highly recommended to anyone who wants to sell books and be successful and effective in the process
anyone who wishes to build a japanese tea room either in the garden or attached to their house could do well to start with this book .  you can also use this book to design accents for a single room ,  or to craft an entire house .  it was written by a german architect who  lived in japan several decades ago and carefully measured surving older buildings as well as studying architecture there .  while there are more detailed books in japanese ,  this may well still be the best available book in english
this book shows you in an easy to read format the true capabilities of the dvd format and what is required to do it .  it helped me in being able to ask intelligent questions when purchasing equipment
i had to read jared diamond's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim .  the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important .  however ,  there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns ,  germs  ( more than the other 2 )  ,  and steel .  of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns ,  germs and steel .  i enjoyed parts of the book considerably ,  but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book .  i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs ,   " collapse "  - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history .  it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now .  -rk
i found this to be a real page-turner .   it addressed all the issues leading to the near destruction of the high plains in the 1930s :  agricultural ,  social ,  political .   dealing heavily with first-person accounts ,  i learned about the dust bowl ,  the depression ,  and the psychology of the times .   great book
reading war and peace is an immense undertaking ,  which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human .  the first time that i read it ,  i read it as a novel ,  for entertainment .  years later ,  i picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious .  i sought to know how tolstoy could justify the ways of god to man .   during this second reading ,  i was able to examine the russian names ,  characters ,  events ,  and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through .  what i saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding epilog ,  which i scanted then but studied now .  most readers of war and peace find this part heavy going ,  which it certainly is ,  but in it ,  tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do .  in essence ,  each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space ,  with one atom colliding at random with another ,  but when a sufficient number act in concert ,  such as napoleon's invasion of russia ,  their force is irresistable .  when tolstoy introduces world leaders like napoleon or the tsar ,  he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom ,  who can not see the big picture any more clearly than anyone else can .   the tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change .   but when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when general kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms ,  then they are drawing closer to a universal  " one "  with nature .   this  " one "  tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with god .  tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that  " one "  or any other deity ,  but he does say that history ,  time ,  and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path ,  and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go ,  then he might wish to emulate general kutuzov ,  who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going .
going into the business ,  i bought this book and found it very helpful .  this one as well as  " i'm living your dream life "  by michele cozzens are well worth the money
it may sound as though i am damning this book with faint praise ,  but i believe that with a subject as complicated as anti-western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener .written in clear non-academic language ,  buruma and margalit have written a book-length essay which further elaborates on the article which they published several years ago in the new york review of books .  the point of the project is to posit a hypothesis on the roots of anti-western feeling and use that to draw open the discussion as to how the gap can be repaired .i notice that the original article sparked much less disappointment than the book .  there is something about the translation to book form which implies a level of completion or comprehensiveness that an essay by itself cannot achieve .  you will find that most reviewers  ( myself included )  had a list of things that we missed in their overview .  these omissions felt serious to me ,  but i notice that the lists have very little in common .  it is truly not possible to please everyone or include everything ,  so perhaps it is just as well that they did not try .if you already have an adament point of view in this discussion ,  then this book may well irritate you .  buruma and margalit clearly do their best to be as objective as possible ,  given their own cultural bias .  if ,  however ,  you are like me and mostly have a clear view about your own lack of answers then you will probably find this a valuable reading experience .  since reading it ,  i lent the book to a good friend  ( sorry ,  publishers !  )  and we have not been able to stop discussing the points that it raised .  quite an accomplishment ,  in my opinion ,  for a self-described short history .
i learnde so much from this book !   i laughed ( yes !  )  ,  i cried ( not really )  ,  and i had the time of my life .   this is a great book .   i've only been around since the late 80s so a lot of jokes were kinda way above me .   but i still enjoyed it !   herman's armpits forever  ( har har
histoire et collections has done it again . a fine work of the quality which the collector and researcher has come to expect from this publisher .i have previous works on the british tommy in nw europe and canadian soldiers .  all are elaborately illustrated with charts ,  individual item photos ,  and reconstructions worn by models of combinations of equipment and clothing as qoen in northern europe .  in addition there are many lists ,  charts ,  and tables gathering together informatioon gleaned from many scarce and obscure publications .muxh of rhia work has appeared in the excellent french language periodical militaria published also by histoire et collections .  this method of proceeding has the great virtue of first publishing in a more temporary format and inviting the readers to submit corrections and additional data which can be used to improve the final work published in book form
i evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that i needed more protein than i had thought and that i reacted strongly to sugars .   i bought this book when i decided to lose a few pounds ,  but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet .   i was already having gall bladder and liver issues .   i bought this book first and 2 . 5 years later ,  it is still the best reference i have .   the chapter on hormones is a bit technical ,  but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book .within three days of eliminating grains from my diet ,  i no longer cared whether or not i lost weight .   my awful blood sugar drops and painful bloating were gone ,  my energy increased significantly and within weeks i noticed that the gall bladder pain was gone  ( and it hasn't come back )  .   within three months my intense hot flashes disappeared and i started sleeping better .the book first describes what low carb nutrition is ,  then goes on to discuss hormones and how insulin impacts the overall balance of the body's hormones in different ways .   it addresses overall energy ,  diabetes ,  heart disease ,  cancer ,  gastrointestinal disorders ,  vitamins and minerals ,  and weight control  ( one chapter - the rest is on health issues )  .
this book is rather different .  although it's about copernicus' book  " de revolutionibus "  ,  very little astronomy is discussed .  there is also very little about copernicus himself .  the main theme of the book is finding as many still-existing copies of copernicus' book as possible ,  and describing each one in detail - the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so-called  " census "  of that ancient book ,  i . e .  ,  a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world .  since i know nothing about antique book collecting ,  i learned a lot on this field by reading this book .  i was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book ,  especially identifying the authors of any hand-written notes on its pages .  i did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous ,  but some of the author's adventures are quite intriguing ,  particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere .  some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book ,  as well as discussions of some of copernicus' contemporaries ,  are touched upon .  but as the author states ,  this book is really a memoir of his census project .  i think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting .
sphere by michael crichton is an excellant novel .  this was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the crichton novels that i have read .the story revolves around a man named norman johnson .  johnson is a phycologist .  he travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the pacific ocean to help the navy in a top secret misssion .  they quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship .  the civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft .  they are joined by 5 navy personel to help them run operations .  however on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave .  the team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean .  after a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an american ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth .this novel does not have the research that some of the other crichton novels have ,  but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis .i would strongly recommend this book
as one reads peter pan ,  one doesn't have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim .   i had ridiculously high expectations of mr .  barrie's imagination before purchasing this title ,  and he has fulfilled them completely .many parts of the story are nothing but nonsense ,  which i enjoy above all else .   mr .  darling ,  the head of the darling family ,  commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine he's supposed to take .   he brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs .   unfortunately for him ,  during his bragging his medicine is found ,  and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three .   sure enough ,  when three is reached ,  everyone except mr .  darling takes their medicine ,  and mr .  darling once again tries to hide his .this kind of scenario is what i'd call mark twain nonsense .   you can imagine it being true ,  even though it's quite high up on the ridiculous scale .   then there's what i would classify as over-the-top nonsense - aka bull - which there is plenty of in barrie's original story of peter pan .   going back to mr .  darling ,  if we take a look at how he's doing near the end of the book ,  we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel .   ah ,  yes .  .  . grown men in pet taxis .   what could be more fun than the  " he-didn't-even-try-to-make-this-belivable "  silliness of such a scene ?   to be honest ,  i don't know if i'd even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this .other silly parts of the book involve wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls ;  the narrator claiming he hates mrs .  darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later ;  the lost boys asking wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it ;  the narrator using the phrase  " woke into life "  because peter likes the word  " woke "  more than  " wakened ;  "  and my favorite ,  captain hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark .i believe the novel version of peter pan was written after the author had already established peter pan as a successful play .   that may explain a lot about the colorful narration ,  which takes many ,  many literary liberties .   we see everything from blatant narrator interference with the characters in the story to the shameless attempt at informing the audience that the narrator only chooses to make the events in the story happen a certain way so certain characters in the book won't be disappointed .   perhaps without these wacky  ( and maybe even insane )  traits in the narration ,  there'd be no reason to read the book ,  since it would be no different from the play .   after reading the peter pan novel though ,  i'd have to say it almost seems criminal to watch an adaptation of peter pan without any wacky narration .contrary to most adaptations of peter pan ,  the individual lost boys  ( of where there are six i believe )  are actually more developed as characters than john or michael darling .   heck ,  at the end of the book they actually end up moving out of the neverland to live with the darlings and grow up to busy themselves in interesting professions .i may not like the actual land of neverland as much as i like the land of oz ,  but barrie's narration is unbeatable in my opinion .   he could probably make a jeopardy contestant's friday night schedule sound exciting .i believe barrie has written another peter pan book as well ,  a prequel of sorts entitled  " peter pan in kensington gardens .  "   it should be interesting ,  particuarly if it addresses what is contained in the dark dreams that haunt peter throughout this book .   freud would have a field day with such dreams and the whole mother issue .the only thing i expected to see in this book that i didn't see was  " happy thoughts .  "   that must have been a creation of disney
interesting ,  well documented ,  with marvelous illustrations . definitely a good buy for adults who still dream  of fairy tales characters .  it is a pity that the collection does not include stories from  " one thousand and one nights "  .  otherwise it will be perfect and complete .
a lot of the reviews i have read here ,  both positive and negative ,  have noted smith's acerbic and sometimes hostile tone .  in my own discussions on god ,  particularly when engaging christians ,  i probably would not use some of the more harsh language found in the book .  it tends to be devisive and unproductive ,  and also reinforcing many of the deragatory stereotypes that are applied to atheists .that does not mean that any of smith's arguments are not legitimate or powerful .  they should be confronted by anyone who takes any position regarding religion or god .perhaps the most revealing and important passage of the work comes at the beginning of the chapter discussing the purported  " proofs "  for the existence of good posited by christian thealogians and laymen .smith explains that  " many times in the past ,  before knowing better ,  i would engage in arguments with theists who claimed to have a rational foundation for their belief .  after several painstaking hours of pointing out flaws in the proposed arguments ,  i would receive some form of the following comment :  'well ,  it really doesn't matter if these proofs are invalid ,  because i have faith in the exstence of god anyway . 'the theist who resorts to this approach has no claim to rationality- only lack of integrity .  "  smith's frustration throughout the text at this type of intrangisence is palpable and ,  ultimately ,  entirely understandable .some of the reviews on this page are illustrative of the general resentment which most christians seemed to hold for the methods by which human beings acquire knowledge and distinguish truth from falsehood .  as an outspoken atheist ,  i have heard these types of decrees repeated to me ad nauseum- and they never stop being disturbing .   " lean not on your own understanding ,  "  i have been told again and again .   " trust in the lord and stop using all this silly logic ,  "  or  " god wants us to believe like children ,  "  they will say .all i hear is :   " i am happy being ignorant .  you will be happy in this delusional fantasy land i live in ,  too .  i know god is not just an inadequate answer to these questions ,  but no answer at all .  things don't need answers ,  or explanations ,  or anything .  everything is ok because i have faith in god .  "hence ,  i sympathize with smith's frustration .  i urge all atheists to read this book ,  which reads more or less like a conversation between an atheist and an extremely intellectual and sophisticad christian who spews  ( practically ) every argument ever conjured to be a believer or to be a christian ,  and has them overwhelmingly refuted .  smith understands the obstanince that atheists will inevitably encounter when christians  ( particularly unsophisticated christians )  are challenged .  this is probably the reason why some of his repudiations seem unnecessarily expatiated .  any atheist who has offered apologetics in defense of atheism knows that trying to engage a christian is like playing whack-a-mole ,  as soon as one battle is definitvely won the christian will retreat into a sheild of ignorance .  this act ,  smith accurately points out ,  will usually involve the word  " faith "  being substituted for ,  but meaning the exact same thing as ,   " ignorance .  "  i assume this is why smith so meticulously tears apart the idea of something that human beings call  " faith "  being an effective ( or even theoretically plausible )  conduit to fundamental truth .  he also points out the common ways that christians like william lane craig and j . p .  moreland use mangled science or language to misrepresent the issues at hand .as a small example of this that i found interesting ,  in  " does god exist ?  ,  "  j . p .  moreland states that he believes that people can actually perceive god through something he calls  " numinous perception .  "  moreland does not give an explanation of how an outside observer could ever deiscern whether someone was having a genuine  " numinous perceptive "  experience ,  or how exactly numinous perception would actually work physiologically or psychologically .  conveniently ,  this would rule out any chance of moreland's hypothesis ever being tested and shown to be accurate or inaccurate .  when someone hears an argument like this ,  one can easily turn to smith for excellent articulation of why they are absurd and illegitimate .smith writes :   "  my argument with the christian is that he claims to have experienced god ,  but he refuses to explain the process by which he ,  a physical organism ,  experienced this supernatural being .  i won't limit him arbitrarily to the traditional five senses ,  but i will demand that he present evidence for his new perceptual powers .  has he discovered a new sense ?  fine ,  then let him tell us about it so we can test it .  no christian has ever succeeded in explaining just how he perceives his mysterious god .  he claims to have knowledge of a mysterious ,  unknowable being ,  having gained this knowledge in some mysterious unknowable manner .  this is totally unacceptable .  "moreland's clever creation of a scientific sounding title for perception of god does not help him .this book will help atheists with this type of argumentation through just about any thread of thought a theological argument can get into .yes ,  the rhetoric 30 years later sounds more sophisticated  ( with other clever titles like  " intelligent design theory "  )  ,  but it is not actually more compelling or sophisticated than when aquinas wrote his five proofs or russell challenged copelston .  i reccomend this book and i can't wait to read  " why atheism ?  "( just as a curious note ,  does anyone know if smith actually debated people in public ?  if anyone knows of any transcriptions id love to read some ,  please let me know if you do .  clark00018@aol . com  )
the story of illidan ,  malfurion ,  rhonin ,  and krasus using dark powers ,  heroic strength is enough to blow anyone away .  iy enchants me ,  it shows the world of warcraft from a combination of knaak's and blizzard entertainment's imagination
pamela jaye smith has an incredible talent for inspiring writers to dig deep into the core of their characters ,  which invariably leads them to discovering their own personal nuggets of truth .  she has an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology ,  spirituality and metaphysics .  yet her real gift is being able to relate all of this amazing information in an entertaining and clear manner so that it's easy to understand .  the book is very well organized and packed with all kinds of valuable treasures .   i highly recommend it
a very good crime fiction book .  connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you don't have it already .  why it's good ?1 )  connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional ,  believable ,  realistic characters and this book is no different .2 )  a very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department ,  he's supposed to have been a crime beat writer .3 )  logical plot .  his books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers ,  but they can't be if they are crime fiction .  rather ,  he takes you through the investigation step by step ,  going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime .cons :  the only con i have is that the books are somewhat noir  ( i'm plagarizing this word from some other review )  .  the thing is ,  bosch is not your spiffy  " yes sir "  ,  toe the blue line cop .  and so ,  even though you want bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes ,  well ,  c'est la vie ,  apparently connelly likes to put angst in his readers' lives .i'm not going to spoil the book ,  if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro .  all i'm trying to get across is why this book is good .  a must buy
the reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded .  the conversations in the book are intelligent ,  the characters and dialogue are real ,  and the descriptions and settings are vivid .  while the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon yale and new haven ,  it is sometimes hard to believe ,  especially given that the author has been a faculty member at yale law school for over twenty-years .  this is not to say ,  however ,  that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate .  rather ,  they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university  ( yale )  and those that are not .in short ,  i enjoyed this book because it kept me guessing and the pace was just right .  this is not a read-it-in-one-day thriller that grisham might come up with .  instead ,  this is a much more intellectual read .  what i enjoyed most about the book are its insights into life itself .  carter uses fictional characters to explore the good and bad sides to marriage and family life ,  careers ,  law ,  and racism in this country .  if you are willing to keep reading when the story seems slow and to learn and grow with the characters  ( especially talcott )  ,  believe me ,  this book will reward you ,  and you'll be glad you read it
i bought my first copy of this book about two years ago .  grabbed my brain and would not turn it loose .  .  . because the pages screamed .  .  .   " this is you !  "  .  i am now 51 years old ,  and have had the cross of adhd  .  .  .  or blessing .  .  .  as you may see it all of my life .i found myself picking up the phone to call close relatives and grabbing friends to lecture them on what was going on .  .  . mostly reading straight from the book .  my mother wondered if my father and older brother had adhd .  dad is dead now ,  but this can help me put some of the dysfunction in our relationship together .   yes ,  i have been persecuted for having untreated ,  undiagnosed adhd .  yes ,  this book explained an awful lot to me ,  gave me real solutions ,  and encouraged me knowing that the two authors are also blessed / victims of this malady / mental enhancement !  i subsequently have bought copies for my aged mother in another state ,  and for my fiance .  i have to say ,  my fiance read it through and studied it like a how to manual for fixing me !   ( she's a little scary ,  sometimes !  )  and of course i sent a copy to my brother ,  the doctor ,  who has added it to his trusted library of resources and textbooks .i am now on one of the medications for the neurotransmitter stimulus .  i have opted out of the antidepressants ,  because of their scary side effect warnings .  but the stimulant works to calm me and flush me with something i don't have without the medication .  it makes a difference .  i feel better and more confident ,  more able to concentrate and more up to meeting all the challenges of life .  what more can i say ?   their attention to all facets including proper medication and case history is fascinating ,  intriguing ,  and extremely useful .  hope is out there
this is one of the best -- and scariest -- business books i've ever read .  christensen clearly illustrates why many of the 'tried and true' formulas really don't work .  his research is compelling and is presented clearly enough for non-technical readers .  i can't recommend this book highly enough
i am an inveterate map reader .  whenever i travel there is a map in my pocket .  but a recent trip to the middle east and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as i tried to put in context  the ruins visited and the coins i collected .  with time ,  the names of cities  and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period .    morkot's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps ,  but the  rationale and context for their evolution and change .  one of the best  features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview ,  followed  by a series of in-depth accounts ,  each from the perspective of the  important &quot ; players&quot ;  during a given historical period .   this  approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the  same information is repeated and new information added as each of the  regions ,  their politics and battles ,  are succesively presented .   from the  mycenae to the parthians are thousands of years ,  thousands of miles ,  and  thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of  influence affect us even today .  for the first time after years of puzzling  over strange grecian place names and leaders ,  i am now able to begin to  understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the  birth of christ .   i wish this had been the first book i read in my study of  ancient history .   i can hardly wait to start on penguin's sequel - acient  rome
this is a pretty good book .   however ,  i would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of lincoln's depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective
to think about racism is to be thoughtful .  to be thoughtful is to be engaged in the process of learning .  to refuse to reflect on and examine your belief systems is to be ignorant
i found this book to contain some really sound advice and i would suggest it for anyone that was contemplating risking their money on the ponies
thank you ,  dr .  null ,  for holistically addressing the health concerns that are predominant in women .   the politics behind female healthcare are shocking and frightening .   you put it all into perspective within these  covers .     you also saved me from the quandary of what to buy all the women  in my family for christmas .    you're insightful and have a wealth of  helpful information .    bless you
i was stunned at how much i enjoyed this book .  i had avoided it for years since i was not a big fan of the movie .  this book really explains well both the history of the civil war  ( troop movements ,  etc )  as well as the personalities of its participants .  it is an intimate portrayal of these characters ,  especially lee and jackson .  i found it to be quite compelling and i'm looking forward to book three of the trilogy
line by line ,  this book has some of the best writing i've seen in a while .   this is an amazing thing ,  since it's still very fast-moving and not at all overwritten .   the author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor .   the book surprised me constantly with its insights ,  and these characters were so real to me by the end that i missed them for a week .   i read craig's first book ,  and it doesn't stand up to this at all .   it's exciting to see how much the writer has improved ,  and i can't wait for the next one
alan lightman is one of those rare individuals who has a solid background in both physics and the humanities .   as a result ,  he has been able to write this very enjoyable collection of essays dealing with the human context of science ,  especially physics .   none of the essays are ultra profound ,  but they're still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading ,  especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited .   this book reminds me of  " feynman's rainbow "  by leonard mlodinow ,  which i also found to be very enjoyable and ,  like mlodinow's book ,  lightman's book is a quick read .as other reviewers have noted ,  the specific essay topics are a mixed bag including autobiography ,  biography ,  the relationship between math and physics ,  the nature and experience of scientific inquiry ,  and other broader topics such as the influence of technology in human life .as indicated in my title ,  if you have at least a popular-level familiarity with modern physics ,  and can also appreciate the humanities ,  i predict that you will find this book to be quite enjoyable ,  and perhaps also somewhat enlightening .   i enjoyed reading the book ,  and i expect that i will read it again in the future
my sons ,  4 and 8 ,  saw this book at a well know book store and loved it .   it costs $20 . 00 there ,  so $13 . 00 is a steal .   they love the pictures and the book is very attractive and  " cool "  looking
peter robinson is one of my favorite authors .   when i travel on vacation i make sure to take his latest novel .     " piece of my heart "  transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago .   the characters were well developed and the story line moved .   there were many layers of sub-plots that were interwoven .   i thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion .
the authors map out clear ,  effective and proven strategies for rewarding parenting in this excellent well-written guide .  an imaginative approach was called for when my 16 year old boy jonathan threatened to barricade himself in his bedroom using just twigs ,  leaves ,  and his own spittle and dung ,  and this guide provided just that .  there's nothing wrong with setting parameters ,  the authors say ,  just as long as that are not arbitrary or capricious and they are clearly articulated - and for crying out loud why should he be allowed to act like a nesting african hornbill under my roof
i really don't understand all the negative reviews about this book .   i found it an easy to read pleasant mystery ,  with a main character in midlife turmoil i wanted to sympathize with .   j .  a .  jance did an excellent job keeping the pace reasonably fast ,  while not losing the reader with extraneous characters .
this is an easy to use instructional manual with practical assignments to help you retain the information given .  highly recommended
my son  ( 34 )  is currently incarcerated .   he asked for this book so i had it sent to him .   he holds on to it for dear life and swears ,  had he read this years ago ,  it would have changed his life for the better and he wouldn't be where he's at .   he raved so much ,  he insisted i order one for myself .   i did .   in summary ,  what i derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first .   otherwise ,  you'll be no more than a stepping stone for others .   it's a good book but i oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by 500-600 years .   fellow inmates that have the book feel the same as my son .   it's a bible to them and they refuse to part with it for others to read for fear it will never be returned to them
barrow ,  an astronomer at the university of sussex when this book was published ,  provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics .   do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics ?   what 'reality' do mathematical entities like pi have ?   what accounts for what physicist eugene wigner has called ,  in a now-famous paper ,  &quot ; the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences&quot ;   ( 299 )  ?   after an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers ,  barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism ,  inventionism ,  intuitionism ,  and platonism ,  a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor .   perhaps most mathematical workers follow what alfred korzybski called &quot ; the 'christian science' school of mathematics ,  which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific' activities&quot ;   ( science and sanity 748 )  .   i commend barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly .   barrow's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations .   as for barrow's conclusions ,  from a non-aristotelian view ,  the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification ,  the confusion of orders of abstracting .   barrow doesn't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics .   he seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him .   as korzybski pointed out ,  we live in a world of multi-dimensional ,  ordered structures or relations .   it does not seem unreasonable ,  then ,  that we can map this world with an exact language of relations ,  i . e .  ,  mathematics .   but as korzybski also pointed out many times ,  &quot ; the map is not the territory . &quot
john little and peter sisco wrote static contraction .  .  .  but john takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight training/ muscle building .  .  my girlfriend and i started doing this method in may of 2005 and i can honestly say i've never found such a fast ,  quick and easy way to build muscle .  this is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym .  .  .  after a while ,  you only need to workout once a week .  .  .  but don't forget to stretch afterwards .  .  .  and don't forget to do cardio on other days .i've never been able to develop the 6pack abs until i used the techniques in this book .  .  .  not to mention all the other muscles popping out that i never knew were there before !  i don't entirely agree with his take on supplements - although i think he's referring to all the stupid gimmicks out there designed to waste your time and money .  apparently he's not familiar with shaklee
only my second james patterson book ,  when the wind blows ,  will keep me coming back for more .   i was not disappointed and look forward to reading many more of his novels .frannie ,  a veterinarian ,  and kit ,  an fbi agent find themselves thrown together in the hopes of saving a few very special children .   surrounded by some mysterious deaths in the past few years ,  including her own husbands ,  frannie now is trying to stop yet another murder .   it all begins when she thinks she sees a girl with wings in the forest near her home in colorado .   from here we learn of genetic experiments and more heinous crimes than those .this book was written prior to the much acclaimed and popular lakehouse with many of the same characters .
add this reviewer to the list of people who hold paradise lost up to the lofty title of the greatest epic poem in the english language ;  it is not only this ,  but one of the best in any language .  writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed homeric epic verse ,  mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by homer ,  virgil ,  and dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work .  the opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by homer ,  as are other elements ,  but milton has a very unique poetic style ;  long sentences ,  often with the principle verb at the end ,  being one of its mainstays .  this language is very grandiose and quite complex ;  it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but ,  as with most classical literature ,  once the reader gets the hang of it ,  it goes quite smoothly .  the divine comedy of dante has a more towring reputation than does milton's paradise lost -- for one thing ,  it is older -- but i among those who find milton to be superior .  the divine comedy is ,  certainly ,  an undisputed masterpiece ,  but ,  where it was ,  more or less ,  a satire and a thinly-veiled attack on many of dante's political enemies ,  milton's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter :   why mankind fell ,  how the gods themselves operate and think ,  the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin ,  the importance of love in human relationships ,  the moral problems of god's justice .  it is true that dante's work is more original ;  paradise lost and paradise regained ,  at least in seed ,  come straight from the bible .  but milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath .  milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the christian tradition ,  to be sure ,  but far from fundamentalist ,  and even quite radical for its day .  although some cite the work as christian apologist ,  there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard-line christians would be taken aback by ;  it was ,  of course ,  even more controversial in its day .  one thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than god .  this ,  in my view ,  does not have milton unwittingly on the devil's side ,  as some critics have suggested .  rather ,  he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is :   of course it's interesting ,  of course it's appealing -- otherwise ,  we wouldn't keep falling for it again and again and again .  if we saw its razor-sharp fangs and  [ dripping ]  mouth ,  we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago .  however ,  as a non-christian myself ,  i cannot but disagree with some points of milton's theodicy ;  the last two books ,  in particular ,  and paradise regained as a whole ,  were ,  for me ,  quite hard to swallow .  i found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing .  milton paints adam and eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share :   joy ,  happiness ,  fear ,  sadness ,  depression ,  and ,  most of all ,  the overriding paramount importance of love .  the act of adam ,  who was not himself  [ evil ]  ,  eating of the apple so that he could follow eve ,  no matter what doom was to befall her and them ,  out of love for her ,  is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature -- as mark twain ,  in the voice of adam ,  later said ,   " wheresoever eve was there ,  there was eden .  "  god ,  satan ,  and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics ;  most christians today seem to have forgotten that god created man  " in his own image "  ,  and that he is not a perfect creature .  likewise ,  satan is not entirely evil -- certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic ,  but so are many humans -- indeed ,  many have seen him as the hero of the poem  ( an errorenous view ,  as i see it .  )  god often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful ;  indeed ,  to many readers ,  myself included ,  this poem doesn't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of gods to men ,  but only reinforces the views we already had  ( mark twain ,  whom i have previously mentioned ,  has a very different view of the situation ,  closer to my own perspective ,  that is worth seeking out .  )  whatever one's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem ,  the poem remains a great work of literature -- poetic ,  grandiose ,  profound ,  extremely readable ,  and thought-provoking .  the shorter sequel ,  paradise regained ,  is also included in this edition .  this work ,  in my view ,  comes nowhere near the glory of it's predecessor ,  but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well .  for that reason ,  i highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works ;  also because the introduction ,  written by dr .  susanne woods ,  is very good ,  and it has notes provided by the wonderful christoper ricks ,  who also edited the poem for this version .  unlike many editors ,  he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text :   they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them .  this is an absolute classic not only of english literature ,  but of world literature ,  and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read
hannah arendt's _the origins of totalitarianism_ is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century ,  soviet communism and nazism ,  and traces their historical roots .   the book is divided into three volumes focusing on antisemitism ,  imperialism ,  and totalitarianism .   the first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of antisemitism .   arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of antisemitism .   for example ,  some historians have argued based on a  " scapegoat theory "  that the jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world's ills .   arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the jews .   arendt explores the rise of antisemitism in the birth of the nation-state ,  the emancipation of the jews ,  the rise of the jewish financiers ,  the roles of jews within society ,  and the infamous dreyfus affair .   of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as benjamin disraeli or the infamous forgery the protocols of the elders of zion .   the idea that the jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of antisemitism .   the second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of imperialism .   here ,  a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as count arthur de gobineau and various forms of social darwinism .   the role of the boers in south africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as cecil rhodes ,  who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic nordic elite ,  is made .   the great pan movements ,  pan-slavism ,  pan-germanism ,  and the pan-arabism of t .  e .  lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored .   the final volume of this book is concerned with totalitarianism proper .   here ,  the role of propaganda and the secret police ,  as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in nazi germany and soviet russia .   arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing .   arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely .   repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent .   written during the cold war period and just after the second world war ,  this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as adolf hitler and josef stalin .   their movements of nazism and soviet communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished .   the book is important today not only for historical reasons ,  but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world
i love joanna brady !   however ,  this introduction to her and her life in bisbee is not the best book jance has ever written .   one thing that is terrific about jance ,  though ,  is that she is from bisbee and describes the town in exact detail .   bisbee is a quaint crazy town and jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert .   joanna brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by .  highly recommended !  !
if you liked empire ,  you'll love multitude .  the authors and reviewers alike speak of multitude as a follow up to empire ,  but i think something very different is happening here .  hardt and negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory ,  and in multitude they have attained a height/depth of perception well beyond empire .  if you are attempting to learn your radicalism ,  or inform your progressivism ,  through hardt and negri ,  then you may see multitude as continuing from and expanding empire ,  and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books .  but what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book :  where empire was the best try we had at the time ,  multitude now succeeds .  where the digression in empire circled around the feeling of our world-cultural hematopoiesis ,  the discursion in multitude captures it .fukuyama attempted to deal with multitude in the july 25th nyt book review ,  and either utterly failed at ,  or purposefully decided to avoid ,  addressing the book qua philosophy .  at this point in his apologizing for economists ,  it is hard to imagine that fukuyama's name has ever been mentioned in the same breath as hegel ,  or that he has ever actually read any of the german idealists ; - whereas with hardt and negri ,  we almost have that level of man among us again .  for fukuyama ,  history has indeed ended ,  because he has stopped feeling it and can now only move around his darkened signifiers .  for hardt and negri ,  and for those who have read ,  listened ,  and felt their way into the great becoming that is world history ,  we are indeed not at its end ,  but at its very beginning .the chief problem with this book is that the english language ,  as a field of common meaning ,  is not up to handling this level of thought anymore .   ( e . g .  ,  the very british cheery insufficiency of george monbiot's 'manifesto for a new world order' .  )  hardt and negri wrote multitude in english ,  but were thinking in german ,  that neoplatonic lego of a language .  so ,  if you consider yourself progressive but can't get the feeling and sweep of multitude ,  then trash your tv ,  stop reading anything written after 1930 for a few years ,  then come back to it .  you will find you have become allergic to cnn ,  but you will also find that - finally - you can *feel* what the world and her history are all about .
every book by jodi picoult grabs you by the heart and doesn't let go .  mercy stands out from all the rest .  you will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time
when you read any of amy tan's books it makes you feel like you are a part of the story .   this book was a great read because it evokes emotions of excitement and sadness for the main character all at once
geez .   its a book folks .   nobody said it was going to be perfect .   granted the sentence structure leaves alot to be deisred but use your imagination .   draw upon your inner child and immerse yourself in the story and stop worrying about the piddly things .   if you want to read books then read them and enjoy them .   if you want to edit them then go be an editor .   we live in a world where people sell drugs that kill our kids for money and your worried about this guy making a few bucks with a writing career ?   it's called priorities people ,  get some .   i say he should continue to write and see what he becomes .i have read tolkien  ( not just the hobbit and lotr - but all of his works )  .   dark tower ,  harry potter ,  and star wars stuff too .   i love sci-fi .   stop nitpicking .   if your at that point then you have lost the purpose of picking up a good sci-fi book .   start over .   do not pass go and do not collect $200 . 00 .
i read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market .  the phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half .  the raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns .  bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the  " new era "  story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay .  but as shown by proven evidence of the past ,  no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later .  when this happens ,  the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible .  the story so far is quite simple .  but what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained .the combination of mass psychology and market prices is at the core of this book .  for bubbles to happen ,  information flow is the key .  media plays a significant role in disseminating information and bubbles seem to have originated in recorded history after the advent of the print media .  in recent times electronic media particularly the television and the internet play a significant role in speeding up bubble formation and also the reversals .  media needs a storyline and this story needs to be continued to retain customers on a daily basis .  stock market is the ideal place that offers an opportunity to try one's luck if a casino is far away .  backed by on-line dedicated news channels and internet trading ,  well ,  it is not surprising that we have day traders in herds .  in such situations fundamentals like industry analysis and p/e ratios take a backseat as explained by the author .  historical averages are breached and a euphoria of  " once in a life time opportunity "  prevails .  what happens to the efficient markets theory in such situations ?  .  since this theory says that markets are perfectly priced based on all publicly available information there cannot be a situation of either under pricing or over pricing .  this book perfectly challenges the efficiency and accuracy of this theory .it is unfortunate that substantial amounts of investments meant to be otherwise risk free sources of income ,  pension funds for example ,  are getting diverted into risky markets .   here the author has come out with a list of some sound proposals to protect hard earned life long savings of innocent citizens who are exposed to the irrationality of markets .the bubble in the housing market is also discussed well .  housing seems to be isolated bubbles occurring in specific regions and not a global phenomenon .  but nevertheless the damage can be the same .  the party of low interest rate regime seems to be over and a spike in mortgage rates is sure to be the needle that will prick right through this big speculative bubble .what goes up has to come down  !  but once you start reading this book ,  it is difficult to put it down .  intellectually stimulating and bound to be economically rewarding .
a time to kill and the broker are my two favs from grisham .   suspense is the name of the game .    i like books that make me read them straight through because they're so suspense filled .  another great novel is deadly behavior by dee sullivan .
kenneth pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of iran from the rise of the persian empire to the reign of the pahlavis  ( pp .  3-100 )  .   pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic iran got wary of meddling foreigners ,  starting with the hated russians and brits ,  in its domestic affairs  ( pp .  4 ,  41 )  .   many iranians have angry psychological scars ,  believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons  ( pp .  26 ,  71 ,  89 ,  99 ,  125 ,  128 ,  155-56 ,  161 ,  173-74 ,  242 ,  297 ,  389 )  .pollack focuses the bulk of his book on a balanced account of the troubled american-iranian relations in the last 50+ years .   the u . s .  started building its  " satanic "  reputation after the cia played a key role in helping the brits get rid of iran's popular prime minister mohammad mosaddeq in 1953  ( pp .  57-67 )  .   mosaddeq's  " crime "  was the  " illegal "  nationalization of the iranian oil industry under control of the rapacious brits  ( pp .  52-56 )  .   the u . s .  did not improve its reputation among most iranians by supporting the dictatorial shah who largely mismanaged the modernization of iran until his overthrow in 1979  ( pp .  xxv ,  72-140 )  .pollack convincingly demonstrates that the truman administration and its successors usually did not exercise enough pressure on the shah to democratize and liberalize iran when they had the opportunity to do it  ( pp .  49 ,  76-77 ,  81 ,  89-90 ,  104 ,  121-24 ,  136-40 )  .   the shah ,  who was ironically considered sold out to the west ,  became less and less amenable to the  " omniscient "  u . s .  ,  beginning in the mid-1960s  ( pp .  39 ,  50 ,  84 ,  94 ,  99-100 ,  107 ,  120-27 ,  158 ,  173 )  .after the revolution of 1979 ,  the u . s .  mostly supported saddam hussein during the iran-iraq war and funded different destabilization operations to contain and try to overthrow the islamic republic  ( pp .  206-16 ,  259-65 ,  273-76 ,  386 )  .   the u . s .  apologized in 2000 for some past misdeeds in an unsuccessful attempt to improve its relations with teheran under the presidency of the moderate but ultimately ineffective mohammad kathami ,  who was under relentless pressure from the hard-liners  ( pp .  xxv ,  303-42 )  .pollack blames with equal conviction the iranians for the awful relations existing between both countries .   iran has built its reputation of international pariah due to the illegal seizure of the u . s .  embassy staff in 1979 ,  its lack of democratic credentials ,  its support of terrorism around the world ,  its opposition to the middle east peace process ,  and its pursuit of  ( nuclear )  wmds  ( pp .  xxi ,  141-80 ,  182 ,  198-201 ,  237-40 ,  248 ,  256-59 ,  266-67 ,  277 ,  345 ,  379-82 )  .    pollack also explains to its readers that many iranians have a poor understanding of the u . s .   ( pp .  50 ,  180 ,  309 )  .pollack does not hesitate to show repeatedly that greed has not stopped the international community ,  including the u . s .  at times ,  from doing business with iran in the last 25+ years  ( pp .  164-65 ,  262-65 ,  271-72 ,  286-89 )  .   iran is trying without much success to emulate china by crushing internal dissent and favoring economic development  ( pp .  xxiv ,  250 ,  369-73 ,  390-91 )  .   the u . s .  will be of no help in this endeavor as long as iran stubbornly clings to its pursuit of acquiring nuclear military expertise on top of other objectionable actions  ( pp .  273 ,  312 ,  324 ,  351 )  .pollack tries to crack the iranian enigma by rightly ruling out an invasion of iran due to its size ,  population ,  and topography  ( pp .  xxiii ,  383-86 )  .   pollack ultimately pleads for a three-pronged strategy that rests on an unconvincing mix of carrots and sticks  ( pp .  375-424 )  .the u . s . -led international community seems to believe that iran will  " submit "  to the  " diktats "  of foreigners in the nuclear crisis without undermining again the  " legitimacy "  of the hard-liners  ( pp .  xxv-xxvi ,  157 ,  251 ,  352 ,  365 ,  395-400 )  .   hard-liners have not forgotten the humiliation of 1988  ( pp .  227-33 )  .   nuclear wmds would shield iran from further  " humiliating "  foreign interference  ( pp .  259 ,  361-69 )  .the shi'i hard-liners ,  inspired by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and co ,  relish martyrdom and heavy sacrifices  ( pp .  157 ,  177-79 ,  222-23 ,  302 )  .   like most of his predecessors ,  president mahmoud ahmadinejad is seeking confrontation with the international community as a way of diverting iranians' attention from their problems for which ideology is a poor solution  ( pp .  158 ,  238 ,  243 ,  293-96 ,  348 ,  369-74 )  .   iranian hard-liners can find plenty of inspiration in the playbooks of adolf hitler and co .the u . s .  will discover again at its own expense that key countries will balk at acting responsibly after iran predictably fails to comply with the legitimate demands of the society of nations  ( pp .  165 ,  262 )  .   iranian hard-liners consider weakness a defensive and reactive policy towards their offensive agenda  ( pp .  218 ,  234-35 ,  266 ,  300 )  .   nothing meaningful will happen until the implementation of very comprehensive economic / financial sanctions and the credible threat of massive strategic bombardments against the nuclear and revolutionary power infrastructure across iran  ( pp .  299 ,  301 ,  392-95 )  .   iran has not been impressed with half-baked carrots like the critical dialogue and ,  with  " mini-me "  sticks such as dual containment and a few cruise missiles  ( pp .  265 ,  273-76 ,  283-84 ,  291 ,  337-38 ,  344 ,  391 )  .there will be no free lunch  ( p .  385 )  .   stepped-up war against  ( state-sponsored )  terrorism will require a series of  " patriotic "  sacrifices to mitigate the inevitable ,  short-term sharp increase in energy prices .   furthermore ,  there will be a new spike in terrorist operations as a  " payback "  for muscular action against iran  ( pp .  253 ,  345-49 ,  354-58 ,  373 ,  392 )  .if iran is not stopped before it acquires nuclear wmds ,  it will indulge with a vengeance its own regional hegemonic aspirations not only in the persian gulf ,  but also in central asia  ( pp .  253-56 )  .   energy prices will not go down in this scenario .   furthermore ,  iranian hard-liners could consider southern russia and chinese xinjiang fair game for their revolutionary agenda due to the sub-optimal treatment of many muslim minorities in these areas  ( pp .  198-205 )  .   their military nuclear program is not purely defensive .   whoever ignores the past ,  will pay a heavy price down the road .
the insights here are simple ,  straightforward and profound .  it explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a no-win situation ,  resulting in a feeling of frustration ,  impotence ,  incompetence ,  and depression .  the only socially acceptable way to express it is rage  ( even though rage is vilified ,  i can tell you that showing hurt ,  pain and weakness invites scorn ,  distain and disrespect ,  even from those who purport to love us )  .by explaining how we get into this trap ,  it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out .  i wish i could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world .  i see so much of it played out every day all around us ,  and the pain both men and women feel because of it does so much damage .  read it before you have a crisis if you can ,  but if you are already in crisis ,  make the effort to read this book even if you can't read anything else .  it might even save your life .  believe me ,  i know what i'm talking about .
exciting and highly entertaining story about 3 men who travel to the centre of the earth through an extinct volcano .  here they come across prehistoric forests ,  a giant subterranean sea inhabited by prehistoric marine dinosaurs ,  and some ancient offshoots of man .  although some of the science bits are outdated ,  implausable and sometimes drag a little ,  the book is still surprisingly modern and fresh after 140 years .  maybe the first adventure novel of this kind and certainly of influence on modern culture .
this rare book details aleister crowley's ascension as the prophet of a new aeon ,  the aeon of horus .  out of all the aleister crowley books in mass market format ,  this stood out in memory years after i read it as one of crowley's most disturbing works .  in fact ,  i questioned my new faith in crowley's religion thelema reading this book ;  this was for real and not a joke .  after contemplating ,  i thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today's youth and crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today .  this is serious stuff ,  i wouldn't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult .  it should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work ;  i did a ritual from necronomicon and lesser key of solomon to help with a college astronomy course- i got a respectable c grade when i close to failing with a d- .  but be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism .
through forster's impressive command of the english language and advanced character development ,  the story of helen & margaret schlegel unfolds .  the sisters--who are highly educated ,  pensive ,  and artistic--become entangled with the wilcox family--practical ,  unilateral capitalists--and the basts--working class and unassuming .  however ,  the initially subtle differences between the sisters  ( and how they approach love ,  misfortune ,  and personal relations )  become more obvious as the novel progresses ,  climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a high-brow english novel .   ( i think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end )  human nature notwithstanding ,  the novel's refinement ,  gorgeous writing ,  and riveting story-telling prevail to the end .  i loved it !
good transaction ,  thank you
i haven't had a chance to read the book in its entirity ,  but have enjoyed what i have read .
mrs .  kent's story applies to each of in the hard places of life .   we all have an  " isaac "  - the person or thing closest to our hearts ,  our future hopes and dreams - that must be layed down .   in telling her story ,  mrs .  kent illustrates the difficulty of this ,  yet demonstrates that it can be done .   she doesn't gloss over the pain ,  yet doesn't leave us there ,  either .   she shows us there is hope
i don't know why the other reviewers though it was a horrible book .  it was absolutely captivating !   i was immediately enthralled in the story ,  and the has such a profound message .
what fun !   this hilarious book is filled withrichman's amusing culinary observations and adventures during his long and impressive career as gq's food ,  wine and restaurant critic .   it is the perfect winter read and holiday gift .  it is witty ,  engaging and even touching at times .   my mother said it was the only thing that made her laugh out loud during her double knee replacement rehab !   i am giving this book to all my friends this year .
this is the first novel by philip roth that i actually like .   portnoy's complaint was a good hundred-page novella ,  spread out over a three-hundred page book ;  the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions ,  and his kvetching about his parents .   operation shylock was also too pre-occupied with pushing a political agenda  ( but just what agenda ,  we are never sure )  .   this is roth's primary fault as an author - he is too didactic .   i find that i really don't care much about what roth's political opinions are .   ironically ,  this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling - it shows that he thinks  " deep thoughts .  "the professor of desire is blessedly free of politics .   in it ,  roth sticks with the subjects he knows best :  sex and relationships .   young david kepesh is a sexually frustrated young student .   that changes while studying abroad in swinging london ,  where he finds that what they say about swedish girls is true .   things take a turn for the worse after the end of his disastrous marriage finds him crushed by loneliness in new york .   with the help of a psychiatrist ,  kepesh tries to discover if he will ever be able to commit to anyone or experience happiness .the professor of desire finds roth at a more mature place in his career .   gone is the odious kvetching about his parents that polluted so much of portnoy's complaint ;  the parents in this book are treated with sympathy .   at one point ,  a character points out to kepesh that there is no point in mining the workings of a jewish family for his fiction anymore .   he is also less homophobic in this novel - but not much so .   there are still things about roth's style that take getting used to ;  i don't think there's anything profound in his refusal to offset dialogue into separate paragraphs - it just makes it harder to keep track of who is speaking .   however ,  the professor of desire is a short ,  lyrical novel that is the best of anything i've read of his so far .
the author ,  james surowiecki ,  lays out and explores a variety of general and specific cases of groups of people acting either wisely or stupidly .   the examples are all easy to relate to ,  and i found them to raise meaningful questions in my mind which were answered in due course in the text .when i think of crowds ,  i think of unthinking masses moving together ,  led by tradition ,  habit ,  or an individual .   how can that be wise ?   a more accurate title would be  " how some groups of people can make better decisions than experts ,  while others act like collective idiots ,  and what characteristics distinguish the two types of groups "  ,  although that's hardly likely to sell as many copies .   : - )for me this really shed some light on my past experiences of participating in successful and unsuccessful teams at work .   i'd sometimes wondered why i've been on a few teams that appeared to  " click "   ( smart people who want to work together to achieve a common goal )  ,  but our results weren't great ,  whereas other teams have been successful .   what was it that made a good team ?   i had some of the pieces ,  felt i still had some real gaps in my knowledge .   this book certainly helped .to paraphrase the basic idea that i took away from the book ,  teams of people can achieve superior results if :1 each individual on the team is well informed ;2 the work of one individual does not influence the work of another ;3 there is an objective method to aggregate individual conclusions into a group conclusion .as simple as they sound ,  there are many ways to fail ,  and the book does a great job of exploring a variety of phenomena that cause failure .

this item is a must-have for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints  ( lds or mormons for short )  .   while not an authentic artifact ,  it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of america's most successful and controversial social-religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries .this reproduction allows the reader to read the original 19th century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of joseph smith  ( author and proprietor )  to the pen ( s )  of his various scribes .when the book is placed in it's historical context ,  the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current lds church as well as smith's answers for many of the religious concerns of his day .also ,  interestingly ,  when compared to the current version of the book and the lds church today ,  the reader can see the evolution of church doctrine over time .for example :the development from a monotheistic doctrine of deity  ( see book of 1 nephi and mosiah - also see lectures on faith ,  also by smith )  ,  to the current polytheistic doctrine that the church espouses  ( see current version of the book of mormon - changing of the text in 1 nephi to correspond with current church doctrine )  .the original condemnation of polygamy  ( marriage to more than one wife at a time )  with the exception of raising up a righteous posterity  ( see book of jacob )  ,  to the open endorsement and practice of the same from the mid to late 19th century for no reason other than smith saying that god commanded the practice ,  then to the abandonment of the practice in order to prevent church property from being confiscated and to allow utah statehood in the union .the condemnation of secret ,  oath-bound clandestine societies  ( see book of helaman ,  3 nephi ,  ether )  to the practice of blood oaths of secrecy ,  loyalty and revenge  ( for the murder of smith )  in the masonic-derived nauvoo temple endowment .the original condemnation and futility of baptism for children and those that die without the law  ( see book of mormon - name of a section within the book )  ,  to the practice of performing all church ordinances  ( including baptism )  vicariously for the dead  ( those that died without the law )  .like all religious/social/mass movements ,  the lds church will evolve and change to meet the needs of its members .   the importance of this book for any follower of the religion  ( or student of sociology ,  history ,  etc .  )  is to chart the origins of the institution and then follow it's metamorphosis over time as the institution attempts to adapt to a constantly changing and growing market .   for that reason alone the book receives 5 stars .
design is a difficult process that is often associated more with art than science .   with principles of style ,  concerns about how design works .while many wring their hands about this ,  alexander breaks the problem down ,  organizes it and then provides a framework for design that is relatively design neutral .   that is a feat in deed .by thinking about how one structures a problem space and the bias that creates -- alexander give the practioner a powerful tool for setting up the design process and scope .   he then goes on to discuss the design process and he makes important distinctions between concious and unconcious design .notes on synthesis and form are the foundation for alexander's work on design patterns .   this is the must read book before spending time on these other works .for the practioner ,  this book provides a powerful and applicable framework for addressing problems in multiple disciplines .
this is an integral desk reference for the reproductive health educator .   this text outlines all that there is to know to date about contraceptive methods and their function .   i don't inted to part with this until the 19th edition is released .
immanuel kant is truly one of the most influential moral philosophers in history ;  and with this book ,  groundwork of the metaphysics of morals ,  he positioned himself far further .in this book you will find things to be deeply contemplated ,  about  " good will "  ,  the moral value of conduct and its metaphysical aspects .this translation of the kant's original grundlegung von metaphysik der sitten to english is quiet easy to understand ,  so it is relatively an easy-reading book
being a dyed-in-the-wool mcguane fan ,  i think he just keeps getting better .   not only is he the best fishing writer alive ,  but his non-fishing stories are bizzarely entertaining ,  have an interesting twist ,  and always explore human interaction .  i believe his writing is based on his many and varied experiences ,  from crazy street people to ego-crazed ceos ,  as well as the many places he has lived .   who else would know what a cabinet is ,  except a rhode island resident ?   what .  .  . no mention of hot weiners or coffee milk ?
i first read this extraordinary book in 1986 ,  just two years after it was first published .   picking it up again ,  i find it eerily applicable to our current situation .  there is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it .  the march of folly brings this message back to the forefront .barbara w .  tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests .  mind you ,  this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous .  and ,  yes ,  i admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20 .beginning with the trojans and their acceptance of the trojan horse to benighted papal policy during the renaissance to britain's stupidity during the american revolution to questionable american policy during the vietnam war ,  the march of folly invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does .given our current war policies ,  efforts and mistakes in iraq ,  tuchman's masterpiece is a very poignant read and we must confess ,  regardless of individual political leanings ,  that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable .  who knows ,  there may yet be a sequel to this one appropriately titled the march continues .the horsema
i always look to see if an author stands in their truth .   if they walk their talk .   dr .  christiane northrup does .   i have read all of her books ,  women's bodies ,  women's wisdom ,  the wisdom of menopause and now mother-daughter wisdom .   they all embody her path to well-being and her knowledge on the subject of women's health .    in her book mother-daughter wisdom ,  she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness .   i find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy mother-daughter relationship .   i have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up .   i found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters .   dr .  northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship .   she addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way .   she talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter .   this book is also a  reference book as dr .  northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughter's life .   mothers ,  men ,  and women without children ,  would benefit by reading this book to connect with their own legacy with their mother or if raising a daughter .
extremely well researched .  mcchesney has been a key figure in the  " media debate "  and he approaches the subject with knowledge and objectivity .  his disciplined ,  almost scientific investigation is an example of non-partisan coverage of a crucial issue .  if only a few politicians were as concerned with the public interest as mcchesney ,  we would be in a better world .  i am a mexican citizen so i couldn't care less about u . s .  partisan politics ,  and if you care about the fate of public communications ,  you shouldn't either .  this is a problem that affects every country ,  not just the u . s . a .  ,  since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the world .  the interest of big advertisers is being protected by u . s .  policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere .  even the smallest community in the south-mexican jungles knows ronald mcdonald .  cnn has latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most latin countries .  as an outsider ,  i hope the u . s .  citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of democrats vs .  republicans but a world-wide issue of the individual vs .  the big corporations .  in reality they don't care about your political affiliations ,  as long as you saturate your credit cards to buy their heavily advertised products ,  you can debate each other to death
this book is full of useful insights .   i was fortunate to hear reichheld present this content at a seminar for marketing professionals .   while some reviewers have complained that his approach is overly simplistic ,  i doubt any of them have actually applied his methodology to their business .   i applied his methodology to my business  ( direct selling )  and had over 6 , 000 interviews completed to identify promoters ,  passives and detractors in the businesses of independent distributors .   consistent with reichheld's findings ,  the segments of my business that were growing fastest had more promoters in their respective customer bases and were performing better across a wide range of metrics .   from the detailed findings ,  we identified best practices that were leveraged across the entire business .   buy the book .   have an open mind .   apply the concepts he has laid out .   if you do ,  you will walk away with useful ideas to accelerate the growth of your business
over the years i managed a staff ,  i grew concerned about the ignorance of basic business behavior among employees .   asking a new staff member to read a book like this might head off some future conflicts .   worth a try .  .  .  maybe even highlight some sections that you feel are most important
at 37 ,  john wade was lieutenant governor of minnesota .  at 40 ,  he ran for the u . s .  senate .  he was heavily favored to win .  at 41 ,  he wasn't just beaten in the primary ,  he was crushed ---  " loser by landslide .  "what happened ?john wade had a secret .  as secrets will ,  it came out at the worst possible time .  and ,  suddenly ,  he was no longer a rising star --- he was a war criminal ,  a killer of babies ,  a man to be shunned .his secret was my lai .the vietnam war is now so far from us ,  and american history --- especially the history of a war we lost --- is so sketchily taught ,  and some of you are so very young that i really ought to take a minute here and ,  in quick brushstrokes ,  relate what happened in a little vietnam village on march 16 ,  1968 .better idea :  let tim o'brien tell it .  he arrived in vietnam a year later ,  and served as a foot soldier there for a year .  got wounded ,  got traumatized ,  the whole deal .  here's his account :at approximately 7 : 30 on the morning ,  a company of roughly 115 american soldiers was inserted by helicopter just outside the village of my lai .  they met no resistance .  no enemy .  no incoming fire .  still ,  for the next four hours ,  charlie company killed whatever could be killed .  they killed chickens .  they killed dogs and cattle .  they killed people ,  too .  lots of people .  women ,  infants ,  teen-agers ,  old men .  the united states army's criminal investigation division compiled a list of 343 fatalities and an independent army inquiry led by lieut .  gen .  william r .  peers estimated that the death count may have exceeded 400 .  at the son my memorial ,  a large tablet lists 504 names .  according to col .  william wilson ,  one of the original army investigators ,   " the crimes visited on the inhabitants of son my village included individual and group acts of murder ,  rape ,  sodomy ,  maiming ,  assault on noncombatants and the mistreatment and killing of detainees .  "eventually ,  after a cover-up that lasted more than a year and after the massacre made nationwide headlines ,  the army's criminal investigation division produced sufficient evidence to charge 30 men with war crimes .  of these ,  only a single soldier --- first lieut .  william laws calley ,  jr .  --- was ever convicted or spent time in prison .  found guilty of the premeditated murder of  " not less than "  22 civilians ,  calley was sentenced to life at hard labor ,  but after legal appeals and sentence reductions ,  his ultimate jail time amounted to three days in a stockade and four and a half months in prison .terrible ,  terrible .   ( and ironic :  seymour hersh ,  who broke the my lai story ,  now writes about the iraq war for the new yorker .  )  but in fiction ,  o'brien doesn't play judge and jury .  john wade may have been at my lai and done terrible things there ,  but he found a way to live with his shame .  and here's the remarkable thing --- tim o'brien bends over backward to see it wade's way .what i tell you now may seem like a plot  " spoiler .  "  it's not .   " in the lake of the woods "  is a mystery --- maybe even a thriller --- but it's totally innovative in form .  that is ,  we know right off that something happened .  the first question is :  what happened ?  and then a gloomier question :  who did it ?what we know :  after the primary defeat ,  john wade and his wife kathy retreat to a cabin in the lake of the woods ,  a part of northern minnesota so remote that there's nothing but water and islands between it and canada .  thirty-six hours later ,  kathy disappears .did she flee ?did she drown ?did her husband --- reliving his vietnam experience --- kill her and dump her body into the lake ?not easy questions .  and o'brien doesn't answer them :   " i tried to make each hypothesis plausible .  john may have killed kathy .  or kathy may have run off with someone else .  or maybe she simply drowned .  or got lost in that vast wilderness .  i believed in each hypothesis as i wrote it .  i inserted evidence to support each hypothesis --- just as life itself gives us contradictory evidence about a great many things .  but in the end ,  it's all a mystery ,  insoluble ,  beyond certainty .  "and to make it more mysterious ,  o'brien tells the story from multiple perspectives .  offers testimony from many people .  cites historical documents .  and then amps up the uncertainly by giving wade a hobby --- magic .and maybe that's what it comes down to --- an ungainly kid ,  an abusive father ,  a need for approval that never got satisfied .  as o'brien writes :" a fat little kid doing magic in front of a stand-up mirror .  'hey ,  kiddo ,  that's a good one , ' his father could've said ,  but for reasons unknown ,  reasons mysterious ,  the words never got spoken .  he had wanted to be loved .  and to be loved he had practiced deception .  he had hidden the bad things .  he had tricked up his own life .  only for love .  only to be loved .  "too simple ?  a clue that takes you away from the solution ?  could be :  o'brien is that good .   ( he won the national book award for  " going after cacciato "  .  the new york times named the things they carried as one of the best books of the year in 1990 --- and chose  " in the lake of the woods "  for that list four years later .  )this much is sure :  you start  " in the lake of the woods "  expecting one kind of book and quickly get another ,  darker ,  scarier book .  you find yourself thinking  " god ,  this is awful ,  "  even as you read faster and faster .  you cringe at what wade might have done ,  wince for what might have been done to him .  and ,  as he comes apart ,  so do you .this is a harrowing book ,  as grown-up as it gets .  it's a great story ,  masterfully told .  and more :  it draws you in ,  demands your opinion .  and then it demands your honest opinion --- because you have your secrets too ,  don't you
lost in the funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you aren't in the right mood for it .   if you aren't well-versed in post-modern fiction  ( barthelme ,  calvino ,  etc are good reference points )  you might want to start somewhere else first .   even barth's novels are more immediately digestible .with that said ,  though ,  this collection doesn't really operate on one consistent level .   perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by barth much earlier in his career .   the three stories concerning ambrose's birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left-field with the titular  " lost in the funhouse "  story  ( which barth is probably most known for )  .   from that point on ,  most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader ,  writer ,  and the characters .   stories like  " title "  and  " life-story "  work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction ,  and were  ( for me at least )  a little tedious .   the best moments occur when barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground-situation ,  typically based on greek mythology .   the best of these are the utterly raunchy  " petitition "  and the labyrinthine  " menelaiad "  .taken as a whole ,  though ,  lost in the funhouse is greatly satisfying ,  even if  ( like me )  you really only understood about 20% of what barth was talking about on your first read-through .   it's the sort of book i'll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor .oh ,  and make sure to read barth's seven additional notes at the front of the book  ( though maybe only after you've read the story that is being discussed in each note ,  so as not to ruin the initial experience ) -- they really help to clarify some of barth's intentions .   i can't even imagine appreciating a story like  " glossolalia "  without having read the note concerning it
this is another collection of barry's columns and a surefire hit for any fan .   as usual ,  his columns pack a punch and end with a zinger or inside joke .   mr .  language person makes an appearance or two in this collection ,  and barry also takes on tv commericials ,  his relationship with his wife ,  and  ( always a winner )  the life of his teenaged son .   recommended

this was the first novel i read from endo ,  and i have to confess to being hooked on it from the first .  it is both interesting from a historical perspective ,  taking in an event that was singularly fascinating ,  and deeply profound from a psychological perspective .  it is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day .hasekura is a deep character ,  and the reader spends a bit of time with hasekura's thoughts .  this is especially so as hasekura confronts the emaciated ,  dying christ that he sees on his travels toward rome .  the possibility of faith in this  " pathetic man "  ,  and the conflict that produces with his duty to lord and ancestors ,  forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with hasekura's desires ,  dreams and simple wishes .  the psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact .a notable part of the book is tied up with father velasco ,  whose ambition seems to know no limits .  his own struggles with ambition ,  and the self-justifications that he employs ,  are a lesson worthy of remembering .this novel is a great one ,  and i was hooked to the very last page .  it will take you into the world of hasekura ,  velasco and their companions ,  as they themselves see it .  it will take you into their dreams ,  their hopes ,  their fatalism ,  their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation .  i totally ,  unreservedly recommend this novel .  i love this novel
i found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk i visit at least once every summer .   i love going there and looking to see if i can find a book that i have never heard of ,  by an author i've never heard of ,  and buy it on a whim .   this is the novel i bought last year .   i has ,  unfortunately ,  sat on my shelf since then until tonight ,  because of many reasons .   tonight ,  however ,  i picked it up and read it cover to cover .   the narrative was brilliantly told ,  the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching .   if i had made it to the end without some tears ,  i would believe myself made of stone !skip is a character many can relate to :  a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out ,  down about how his friends have really not been friends at all ,  that gets the chance to do something great by this little child .   however ,  it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the blessings of the title .   faith ,  a name not used lightly ,  restores her namesake in all those touched by her .   she ultimately gives him the chance  of making something of his life without even knowing it .   many blessings occur in this wonderful novel ,  and i found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times ,  but also proud at how humankind can be at others  ( which is a fact ,  in itself ,  that proves how well quindlen has spun her tale )  .   the fact is that just because a person has been to jail ,  has deadbeat friends ,  does not mean he is of that same stock ;  just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her .   skip ,  lydia ,  nadine ,  meredith ,  jennifer .  .  . all have many dimentions to their characters that quindlen has spectacularly drawn

greg treverton has written a much needed overview of the national intelligence process and correctly identified the challenges which face the us ,  in a post-9/11 world .   his views of the world beyond 2010 are quite revealing and his challenges to the intelligence community to assess threats to the us are precisely focused .  his views on the major intelligence entities reveal urgent modifications of structure and process ,  if the intelligence community is going to regain relevance with national customers .   as a teacher of intelligence process ,  specifically as it relates to strategic warning ,  i believe this book is essential reading for anyone who aspires to be a true intelligence professional .  this book will help even the wisest analyst understand how to maximize available sources and methods .   the quest to provide the best possible intelligence is a goal which must be achieved .
i found lovemaps a valueable and insightful look at the way individuals relate to sexual behavior and establish their sexual identify and desires based on life experiences which as dr .  money indicates occurs in childhood and which is unconsciously formed by the individual .  i found this book extremely helpful while working on my doctorate in human sexuality and now 6 years later as i continue my research and work as a sexologist and sex therapist .  i highly recommend this book to other sexologist and clinicians ,  as well as any man or woman who is interested in learning more about sex and sexual behavior ;  and in essence more about themselves .  it definitely helps if you read a book before judging it .  and this book should be in everyone's  " sensual library "  .   live with passion ,  dr .  charley ferrer ,  author of the latina kama sutra ,  the w . i . s . e .  journal for the sensual woman ,  para la mujer sensual ,  el kama sutra latino ,  the passionate latina :  in our own words .  .  .  www . instituteofpleasure . org
red lily is clearly the best book in the series .   while reading this one i could visualize the scenes .   this book would make a good movie ,  but i can't decide under what category it would fit into .   although it's clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller .   with all the talk of a ghost  ( as the rest of the series )  this book it isn't a believable read as much as a fun read .
v .  i .  lenin wrote this book in 1917 ,  while he was hiding from the russian government .  lenin pointed out that  " the question of the relation of the state to the social revolution ,  and of the social revolution to the state ,  like the question of revolution generally ,  was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the second international  ( 1889-1914 )  "  .  he wanted to correct that oversight ,  and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book ." the state and revolution "  is a very short book ,  well structured and not difficult to read at all .  initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters ,  but lenin didn't conclude the seventh ,  due to the outbreak of the russian revolution .  in the postscript to the first edition he explains that ,  saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time ,  but that all the same  " it is more pleasant and useful to go through the `experience of revolution' than to write about it "  .the main idea in  " the state and revolution "  is that the state is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms ,  and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class  ( a  " special coercive force "  that rules through violence )  .  the state of the bourgeoisie will disappear ,  but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat .  the proletariat  ( the working class )  will become then the ruling class ,   " capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie ,  and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system .  the proletariat needs state power ,  a centralized organization of force ,  an organization of violence ,  both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population -the peasants ,  the petty bourgeoisie ,  and semi-proletarians- in the work of organizing a socialist economy .  "the dictatorship of the proletariat will be only a first stage in the path to communism  (  " then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase ,  and with it to the complete withering away of the state "  )  .  according to lenin ,  the necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with the idea of the necessity of violent revolution lies at the root of the entire theory of marx and engels .  all throughout this book ,  lenin cites and examines marx and engels' writings ,  in order to explain and support his own point of view .the importance of marxism for nowadays world has diminished enormously ,  but i advice you to read this book nonetheless .  it is certainly not a grueling task ,  and it will allow you to understand better some notions that many marxist leaders believed with all their hearts .  ideas drive men ,  and men make history .   " the state and revolution "  will help you to get acquainted with some of those ideas ,  and that is not a small feat .belen alcat

os guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply .   this book is no exception .   the fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section .one of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays ,  all around the central theme of the importance of character .   while our culture often acts to create an  " end justifies the means "  behavioral set ,  never before has character been so important ,  or so difficult to really practice and live .the book begins with some essays from famous leaders ;  from plato to george washington ,  winston churchill to machiavelli ,  and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character ,  and how it was to be demonstrated .   much of the material is pretty well known ,  yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort .my favorite sections were on the  " cultural erosions of character "  in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all .   from advertising ,  to media ,  the pressure to conform is greater than ever ,  but in some ways has always existed .one of the best essay's in my opinion is called the  " revenge of failure "  wherein henry fairlie rips the  " legend of our times "  ,  as envy at its worst .   no longer content to envy what others have and we do not ,  we now attempt to destroy in others that which we cannot achieve ourselves .   this process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to  " buy "  our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable ,  but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable .   thus character becomes something that is no longer  " earned "  .the sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character .   in this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection ,  the hunter becomes the hunted ,  and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance .    powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance ,  are depicted with a convicting clarity .overall ,  this is a very well done and thought provoking book .   as a study guide it would be ideal for small groups ,  or even personal reflections .   the book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once ,  or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness .   highly recommended .
in light of rev .  falwell's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of sept .  11 ,  2001 ,  i recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand ,  &quot ; why would that guy say that stuff ? &quot ;  harding presents an objective ,  intelligent ,  perceptive analysis of the way that fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world ,  and how jerry falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active moral majority of the 1980s .  harding combs through falwell's history and sermons to observe how the language of &quot ; being born again&quot ;  affects the listener ,  showing falwell's shift from separatism to political activism .  she critiques both falwell and falwell's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way .  good reading and good understanding
i've been staring at a copy of thomas friedman's 'from beirut to jerusalem' on my shelf for nearly a year now ,  meaning to read it but always drawn to something else .   finally ,  recent events demanded that i learn more and i finally pulled it down ,  dusted it off ,  and read it .   i'm so glad i did ,  especially now .the book is not the easiest read ,  since it delves into a lot of regional history and politics ,  which gets complex no matter what you do .   friedman's writing style ,  however ,  goes a long way towards making the text quite accessible for just about anyone ,  and his unique perspective on the events that he witnessed and covered in his role as a journalist keeps it interesting and always relevant .what i really appreciated about the way friedman presents his story is that it really is his story .   he is obviously a man gifted with a keen sense of observation ,  and so he picks up on many details others might miss ,  such as the faces of israeli soldiers or the opinions of lebanese taxi drivers .   but still ,  the story is told mainly through events he observed directly -- he just happened to be there for many of the events that shaped the middle east as it is today .   he tells it in both large and small terms ,  from some of the politicians he met and interviewed to discussions he had with neighbors and colleagues while living in the region .   the result is that you get the broad spectrum of what was going on in the region ,  particularly in the 1980's ,  a critical decade of events .i also appreciated friedman's fairness throughout the book .  from his perspective on the lebanese government to the palestinian intifada to the israeli occupation to the american involvement in the region ,  he deals with all of the players fairly ,  whether big or small ,  famous or unknown .   that's not to say he doesn't have criticisms -- certainly ,  he has plenty to say about everyone .  .  . but one is never left with the feeling that he has been too harsh on one side and lenient on the other .   friedman's willingness to observe with an unbiased eye and ear is key to the strength of this book .even with the newer added chapters ,  dealing with the late 1980's and early 1990's ,  this book cannot be considered a  " complete "  history of the middle east ,  or even of the events of the last 50 years .   however ,  it is not meant to be that ,  i think .   what friedman has documented here is an excellent primer for anyone interested in learning more about how we got to where we are today in lebanon and israel and palestine .   the book is not an end in itself ,  but for someone who wants to learn more about the region that is in the news almost every day ,  this is an excellent place to start .the only way to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past is to learn from them .  as such ,  'from beirut to jerusalem' should be required reading today
i am a big tananarive due fan because she never fails to deliver the goods in terms of interesting plot ,  storyline and characters ,  which many can be anyone of us .  she is a fascinating author as she creates several different scenarios that are very different over a great span of time and unites them in a way that is nothing short of amazing .  keep up the good work .  .  .  .  . a t .  due fan !  trinice s .  moses - sisters with a purpose book clu
my kids and i love this book .   there were so many cute ideas ,  several parties worth .   pirates are a hit with most kids and this book uses this theme combined with simple objects to make things that kids will think are awesome .   i especially liked the recipes ,  the place cards ,  the ideas to make with salt dough ,  and the pirate facts throughout the book
" spring snow "  is unquestionably one of the finest japanese novels ever written ,  as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right .   it is an eloquent ,  moving story with a  " tale as old as time ,  "  that of star-crossed lovers who's love transcends social roles and obligations .in another culture ,  with another writer ,  this would be a romantic ,  if not happy ,  story .   but this is japan ,  and the writer is mishima yukio .   in his hands ,  the lovers kiyoaki and satoko transcend literary stereotypes ,  and become agents of their own happiness and destruction .   by the very nature of their relationship ,  raised together since childhood ,  playing a complicated cat-and-mouse game of love and sexual tension ,  their future is never in doubt .it is impressive that a writer such as mishima ,  known for his right-wing politics and his samurai dreams ,  could craft such a tender love story .   while knowing the eventual conclusion ,  the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between kiyoaki and satoko ,  and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared .     not that it is a clear path .   even knowing japanese literature ,  and the road it usually takes ,  there are surprises on the way .   things do not turn out the way one would expect .i was incredibly moved by  " spring snow .  "   it is a novel that affects the heart of the reader ,  and lingers long after the last page is turned .
since reading this book in 1994 ,  i have used it as a reference for my life and work .  using a warm and witty style of writing ,  allen teaches us the physiological and emotional benefits of mirth .   my favorite chapter title is &quot ; strike while the irony is hot ! &quot ;   so clever !  !  i recommend this book to friends who are facing life challenges and to everyone who attends my workshops .   on a more personal note ,  since embracing the healing power of humor ,  i felt freer to add a little levity to my aunt alice's funeral .   my family was amazingly grateful .     me too
this book sucks you in from page one !   it's entertaining and witty !   no need for more detail
i admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in  " piece of my heart .  "  di stanley chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert .  his teenage daughter has facts to hide and di chadwick walks a fine line .  dci alan banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder .the plot has already been outlined ,  so i'll just say it's a delight to visit dci banks again .  i'm never disappointed
i loved this book !    i picked it up on a whim at the airport ,  and couldn't put it down for the entire flight .  now i'm telling all my friends to get it .   not only does it have tips about playing cards ,  but it's just a flatout pageturning thriller .   you keep wondering where this guy's life is going to lead him next .   very suspenseful and funny too .   highly recommended .
sometimes when you read a book you are expecting to read some details , but a book like this blows the lid off the mother fully .  deborah santana doesn't hold back at all .  she takes you on a journey from her childhood to her teen years with sly stone . &then eventually with her husband carlos santana .  you read about a strong woman who overcame so many obstacles&was grounded strongly&thrived despite some negative forces .  a very powerful book that you simply can't put down .  deborah santana is a remarkable soul sister .  this is a must read book from start to finish .
i liked this book because it was quick and easy to read ,  but also had more in-depth information in the back .   each month ,  there is a chart of symptoms to let you know what is important to go to the er ,  call your doc ,  or wait 24 hours to check .   there were great decision guides that presented both sides .   i like that i know a reputable hospital stands behind the book ,  as well .   i have 6 pregnancy books ,  but this one is my favorite
mr .  bones is a very special dog ,  a dog who understands ingloosh and almost speaks it .  a dog who is happy roaming about the country with his master ,  willie g .  christmas .  if willie is homeless ,  probably schizophrenic ,  certainly eccentric ;  if they rarely have enough to eat ;  if he doesn't always understand willie's metaphysical ramblings--what does that matter between a dog and his best friend ?  alas ,  in the first chapter ,  willie is coughing up blood ,  and mr .  bones knows that willie is going to die .the entire story is told through the point of view of this remarkable dog .  is it the story of a dog ?  or the story of willie ?  or the story of life in america ?  or a story about love ,  alienation ,  betrayal and loss ?  well ,  it's all of these .  and what is timbuktu ?  for that ,  you will have to read the book .  i'm not going to tell you .author paul auster is a genius with language .  somehow he draws you into this improbable story and makes it believable .  more than believable .  compelling .  does he really get inside the mind of a dog ?  who am i to say ?  i can only say that for me he makes the mind of a dog as believable and understandable as any other mind .some reviewers expressed disappointment with this book ,  but i thought it was wonderful .  just let it speak in its own voice and take it for what it is and you will love it .  i recommend timbuktu highly .  reviewed by louis n .  gruber
this was the very first jonathan kellerman book i had ever read .   this is by far the best one he ever wrote .   i don't think that i have ever read a book so riveting and suspensful .   it's like watching a top notch horror/mystery movie .   this has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone .   i still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now .   i give this book a 5++++ star rating
for those who have not read volume 1 ,  just get book 2 and get all the great information plus lots more .   being a born-again christian ,  some of the dialogue is beyond my belief system ,  but just glean the book and keep the great stuff .   if your faith is well-grounded ,  just look at this as a first class medical journal and forget the buddhist hogwash
an outstanding ,  conceptually challenging ,  classic exploration of the ontology of art .  it may be daunting at first ,  but once you become accustomed to the level of abstraction of the text ,  it is extremely  rewarding
anna anderson/ anastasiai have researched this great mystery for some time now and i have concluded that the woman ,  anna anderson ,  could not have been an imposter .  not only did she never give any signs of playing a part ,  but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known .  she knew of gleb botkin's paintings before he even came to see her ,  she knew exactly what she and her sister tatiana had been doing while wwi was being declared for russia  ( this was confirmed by dr .  rudnev who was visiting russia and saw anastasia and tatiana at that time )  ,  she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in europe ,  and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone .  one must wonder how a demented polish farming girl could do that .  aside from just her character ,  there the many scars and lacerations on her body ,  as well as the bunions on her feet identical to anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support anna anderson's claim .  for over six decades ,  royal cousins and friends to anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks .  they would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would .  it is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake .  anna had people such as alexei volkov and alexadra tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched .  no one has ever yet attempted to explain why ambassador zahle and grand duke andrew's papers are still kept secret ,  why doris wingender touched up her photographs in court ,  or why pierre gilliard had his scandalous midnight 'burning' of evidence .  to this day ,  anthropologists who compare anna anderson's face ,  ears ,  and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the  " two "  women are the same .the franziska schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end .  anna anderson was several inches shorter than franziska schanzkowska ,  wore a size shoe three inches smaller ,  was not mentally insane like franziska ,  she spoke a bad german while fs spoke german as her first language ,  and could understand russian .  the schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of russian when spoken to them .  aa clearly understood russian .  anderson also gave birth to a child .  there is no record of franziska ever having a child .  recent documents also show that schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on anna anderson's body .  the dna tests have won the hour ,  but i hope the future will see the release of ambassador zahle and gd andrew's papers to cast even more doubt on this .  richard schweitzer's switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at martha jefferson hospital during the complicated court battle between marina botkin schweitzer and the russian nobiltiy association .  according to massie's book ,  one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time .  is it reasonable that the royal families would ignore the fact that anna anderson was about to recieve recognition as the tsar's daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life ?in any case ,  the body of anastasia is still missing ,  although in russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads 'anastasia' measuring 5'7 ,  despite the fact that anastasia was the shortest of her sisters .  if this isn't reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda ,  i don't know what is .  i'm afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over castle seeon under the stone which reads ,   " anastasia manahan 1901-1984 "  .to end this ,  i will quote empress alexandra's best friend  ( aside from anna vyrobouva )  lili dehn ,  who met anna anderson in 1957 (  ?  )  and declared ,   " don't bother to tell me she has read these things in books .  i have recognized her physically and intuitively ,  through signs which do not decieve .  what can i say after having known her ?  i could not have been mistaken .  "this is to explain my conviction that anna anderson was anastasia .  i think there is something about the dna we do not know .the file on the tsar- 2002 edition .  .  .  p .  362'nearly fifty years ago ,  anna anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in tobolsk .  she played a male part ,  she 'recalled' ,  and and had to borrow a man's dressing-gown .  at a pivotal moment in the play ,  a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs ,  revealing that she was wearing the tsar's long-johns- against the bitter cold of the siberian winter .  the family ,  said anna anderson ,  had hooted with laughter .the only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene ,  and who are known to have survived ,  were the two family tutors-both foreigners .  one was the english tutor ,  sydney gibbes ,  and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975 .  they include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in tobolsk ." the cast ,  "  gibbes wrote ,   " had its happiest night with an edwardian farce by henry grattan ,  called 'packing up' ,   .  .  .  anastasia took the male part .  .  .  at the end of the farce the 'husband' had to turn his back ,  open his dressing-gown as if to take it off- anastasia used an old one of mine .  .  .  but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back ,  showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased emperor jaguer's underwear .  .  . 'so far as exhaustive research can establish ,  only anna anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote ,  in private and three decades before the gibbes memoirs appeared .  if anderson was a phoney ,  as the seemingly damning dna evidence now tells us ,  how did she know the story ?that was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in anna anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict .  ian lilburn ,  a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the  " anastasia "  appeal process in the german courts ,  had a calmer response than some .   " i think ,  "  he said ,  knowing he sounded like a luddite and romanov flat-earther ,   "  there is something we don't know about the dna .  "maybe after reading you can understand why some of us don't believe the dna was anna anderson's ,  and why we don't believe she was the tall ,  size '36 shoe wearing franziska schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter .
my pick for the finest book of 2005 .   ( ok smith's on beauty is up there too )  we know from page one that we are  in the hands of a master craftsmen !  reading ian mcgawen is like watching a great pitching performance .  it might be slower paced than you'd like but god is it beautiful .fraught with elegance and grace  " saturday "  is a great read and the work of a true literary giant .  i highly reccomend this book .
if you want to take your pictures to the next level this is the book for you .  fantastic and easy to follow  .  .  for the advanced amateur and pro
note to reviewers - the title of the book was a play on hillary claiming that there was a  " vast right wing conspiracy "  against her husband in the monica scandal - she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy  ( right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything )  .this is an excellent non-polemical book that sets out the steps taken by the left to unseat bush .  i watched from canada and monthly visits to the us  ( business )  and the book accurately reflects what was going on  ( rightly or wrongly )  at the time .it describes how a loose linkage of the media ,  hollywood ,  pop stars ,  moveon . org  ( soros )  ,  academia ,  kerry spinmeisters and the intelligentsia on the left and right coasts self organized to bring down bush and the gop .it is a good read and ties together many of the disparate threads into a reasonably accurate picture .  perhaps the book can be faulted - hence only 4 stars - because there certainly was strident activity on the right too .  limbaugh ,  hannity and o'reilly ,  of course ,  doing their thing although not with the power of the mainstream media and hollywood behind them .for me the interesting theme he points out is the self organizing nature of the endeavour driven by an almost irrational loathing of bush .   recall many hollywood gliterrati threatening to move to canada if bush was elected .i'm editorializing here - but it does seem strange that some reviewers - notably one from the uk - use this site as a platform for gross anti-us ,  anti-bush remarks rather than taking the time to actually critique the book in question
i found this in the church library ,  but it is not christian fiction .  it is simply an easy read .  the story is sweet ,  made even sweeter by the topic .  cake .  i am not even much of a cake person .  i normally prefer ice cream or some sort of brownies/cookies ,  etc .  .  .  but ,  as i read ,  i found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator .  i don't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet .  the need for sweets will be simply overpowering
guys and dolls is a fantastic musical ,  and this vocal selections book is a good representation of it .  unfortunately ,  some songs like marry the man  today ,  my time of day ,  follow the fold and the oldest established have been  left out from the book ,  but that is the price you pay ,  or rather don't pay ,   when you don't buy the full vocal score .  however ,  this book will satisfy  fans of the show ,  complete with pictures from the original 1950 broadway  production ,  the 1955 film ,  and the new 1992 broadway revival .  definately ,   this book is a good buy
this book has easy to understand &amp ;  have up to date case .  the harley davidson case is one of the cases that showing us how's struggling us to face japanese company offensive .  this is the good case to picturing the dawn to earth marketing strategy compare to arrogant &amp ;  not efficient strategy willing by us company
each planet listed in this book has details on length of day ,  length of year ,  species ,  population ,  size ,  climate ,  terrain ,  & much more .  each one also has a picture of the planet accompanying it .there's also a map of the core worlds along with key location / site maps on nearly every listed planet ( very cool )  .coruscant has a huge 29-page entry to it .  it also has the gm character dexter jettster ,  info on the jedi temple ,  and many more spots on this planet .   great for many ,  many adventures .alderaan & corellia get around 7-pages .there's also a few new species ,  many new creatures ,  and a lot of gm characters to throw at players .some starships are also in here ,  inlcuding  :  tie/ad defender prototype & e-wing .my only complaint is ,  there aren't more of these planet books out there for this rpg .   wotc could have done a series of secrets of .  .  .  books for each system  ( or something like that .  )otherwise ,  there are a lot of things in this book that will make players believe that their characters are in star wars .so ,  yes ,  buy the book !  support this space fantasy rpg
we are so truly lucky to live in an age when something like this is possible !  without existing virtual technologies ,  compiling a complete collection of the new yorker would otherwise be a near impossibility due to space considerations ,  availability ,  and of course the daunting financial investment .  for the price of a modest concert ,  eighty years of intelligent discourse ,  satire ,  observation and fiction are all available .  i have nothing negative to say about this ;  it does what it promises and does it well .  it still amazes me that i now have every issue of the new yorker ,  and look forward to the continuation of this extraordinary trend of publications releasing the entirety of their output
kudos to finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter .   the fact that he himself ,  a descendent of holocaust survivors ,  has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points :  you cannot criticize the state of israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti-semite .   any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless un resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism .   by far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the swiss banks ;  this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition .   finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion .   very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work .   hilberg's endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight ,  and those unfamiliar with his seminal multi-volume set the destruction of european jews would be well served to check it out
this book was so different from what i thought it was about when i ordered it .   it still was knowledgeable .   it is hard to grasp as you must actually do the experimentation .   i also thought the illustrations should be in color since that is what the book is about .   it has some examples in the beginning of the book but i hate to keep looking around in books i personally like it to appear in front of me as i read .   it was a very interesting book to say the least
the hellion bride is the second book in bride series .  i love ryder and sophie and the joy of meeting other characters from the sherbrooke bride .  i kept turning the pages to find out their secrets .  deceptive and abusive uncle theo as well as murder scenes make the story more thrilling and a suspense .  the virgin bride also comes in handy and she is an angel rather than a ghost for she always is encouraging and very nice .  sinjun pleasantly spices up the whole story .  i can't wait any longer to read her own story the heiress bride
i thought that the two books previous to this in the duncan kincaid/gemma james series were slight disappointments .   kincaid seemed relegated to a side character with gemma taking the lead .   in a dark house is an excellent mystery that brings the two back to equal ground and re-establishes them as one of the best partnerships in mystery fiction
interesting thoughts !   it makes one think about why we do the things that we do .   i look forward to sharing some of theses ideas with my daughter when she is a little older .   i think that it is worth reading .   a new outlook on dating
this is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you don't have faith in the supernatural ,  you have no reason for hope .according to this book ,  the rational world is such an unpleasant place that ,  if you are not religious as schaeffer defines religious ,   "  [ t ] he only way of escape lies in a nonrational fantasy world of experience ,  drugs ,  absurdity ,  pornography ,  an elusive  " final experience ,  "  madness .  .  .   .  "piffle !throughout history ,  a great many people found life to be good without resorting to either madness or schaeffer's brand of religion .  and indeed ,  religion and rationality need not be foes ,  as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers ,  such as isaac asimov and stephen jay gould .  reduces our choices to  " religion or madness "  is just silly .schaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality ,  but authoritarianism with a clerical face .  his fans won't like that characterization ,  but my job as a reviewer is to tell you what's in the book ;  if you seek comfort in authoritarian religion ,  this book's skillful wordcraft makes it is a good place to start
i am an experienced java programmer .  this book together with the netbeans ide allowed me to come up with a j2me application in less than a week .  the examples in the book is a great resource for learning to write j2me applications .  i learn best when i'm coding .  in my case ,  i used the source from the peekandpick rss reader to come up with my j2me text reader .  the program has been heavily modified since ,  but the book provided sample code that was a great starting point for my learning .
michael farquhar has created another bathroom book for the history-loving set .   this one ,  treasury of deception ,  is just what it's title implies and is broken down into categories and ranges from prison escapes to scientific frauds ,  from practical jokes to deadly hoaxes ,  such as the blood libel .   it is a truly odd mixed bag and should be read over a long period in many small bites ,  although that may prove harder to do than anticipated and one may find oneself gobbling the whole thing down at once .   the book is light at the right moments and more serious when required and ,  amazingly enough ,  never veers into the truly silly ,  which is a blessing

as soon as people see breton's name on a book ,  they immediately feel indignation and privately exclaim ,  &quot ; the dictator of surrealism ! &quot ;  what they don't seem to realize is that ,  despite being a flawed and somewhat ambivalent man ,  he probably had more passion in his pinky than they do in their entire body .  &quot ; nadja&quot ;  is simply one more delightful proof of breton's genius and his infallible flair for the surreal ,  the mysterious ,  the mystical ,  and everything that is profoundly divergent .  in this tale of intrigue and obsession he travels the streets of paris with a ghostly ,  clearly insane young woman who calls herself nadja ,  which is the russian word for hope .   the most captivating parts of the novel are the bizarre and surreal conversations he has with her .  even though he found her incredibly fascinating and almost an ethereal enigma ,  things start to turn sour between them and breton grows bored with her .   at the end of the novel ,  nadja is put into an asylum after the police are called because of her incessant screaming and apparently incoherent behavior ,  some of which suggested that she was living in a world of hallucinations and irrational fears .   we do know that nadja was a real woman and not by means some fictitious creation of breton's ,  and we also know that she came to a somewhat unfortunate end .  it may be true that breton's behavior and attitude of indifference and deliberate ignorance about her truly wretched fate  ( she died of cancer ,  insane and completely alone )  is indeed nothing to admire ,  but those who put too much emphasis on this admittedly accurate fact forget that while he may in a sense have betrayed her ,  he also made a truly admirable effort to make the world see nadja and those like her as no one has seen them before ,  and immortalized her in a book that is absolutely unforgettable and breathtakingly beautiful .  breton was a profoundly hopeful and truly revolutionary figure who exhorted humanity ,  even while the second world war raged and reaped it's devastating results universally on all of mankind ,  to recognize the miraculous and wondrous nature of our very existence ,  however 'absurd' or meaningless some felt it to be after the horrendous events of the twentieth century .  it is true that he occasionally goes over the top with his optimism ,  but his iron will and determination to fight 'miserabilism' ,  the philosophical justification of human misery ,  at all costs can only call forth our admiration .  his exaltation of the imagination as the highest of human faculties and the sole organ of man that will allow him to attain felicity seems to be verified by direct ,  concrete experience of life .   as we grow older and we come to realize that sensual pleasure is a big part of life but essentially empty and hollow ,  our inner lives  ( hopefully )  become more vivid and we end up spending more and more time there .  breton knows this and wants us to cultivate it to the highest degree possible .  don't be fooled by the 'anti breton' rhetoric and take a dismissive attitude toward him ,  because you'll be missing out on some of the most fascinating books  ( to my mind )  ever written
this is the best baseball book ever !   not only is it beautifully organized and rich with facts ,  but it's so well written !  as someone who came late to baseball ,  i find the book hard to put down .   if you can only buy one baseball book ,  this is it--it's a major reference for any fan ,  and it's going to make a great holiday gift too .   get your copy before they're all gone
for most of us ,  the area of thanatology is something quite new ,  despite the fact that death is such an intimate  " companion "  that can come at any moment of our lives ,  whether by degrees or instantaneously ,  irrelevant of our ethnic ,  social and economic backgrounds .  it is a plain truth that can not be avoided ,  and no technological advancements can make it go away .  i would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you ,  despite what your feelings may be .  and as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier ,  the adult must equally do so with death ,  not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means :  the total cessation of physical life ,  for if one denys its existence and its inevitability ,  the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache ,  but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental ,  spiritual and religious grief as well .  submission to and acceptance of the truth ,  no matter how difficult it would be to hear ,  could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing .  in elizabeth kubler-ross's classic study of the dying process ,  she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them .  but even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person ,  the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all .  hence ,  how do you take the sting from the wound ?  in on death and dying ,  you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say ,  to let them vent ,  and at their own pace ,  go through the classic defined stages of the dying process :  denial and isolation ,  anger ,  bargaining ,  depression and acceptance .  the patients become our teachers .  we learn of their fears ,  their possible financial burdens ,  in one woman's case ,  the fear of the worms ,  et cetera .  but we also learn about what the families go through ,  their own anger and disbelief and guilt .  it is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved .  sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger ,  other times not .  the united states is one of the most death-denying countries out there ,  a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process ,  for going foward means only one thing :  death .  ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is ,  the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe .  death has issues for everybody ,  doctors ,  faith-filled people ,  even ross heself .  it is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later .  but it is comforting to know that we are all in it together .
a great reference book to have for any designer ,  although a little tedious at times a solid read with a great historical overview of the subject .  i would definitely recommend to any enthusiastic designer with a thirst for knowledge on things typographical .since reading ,  i have become more critical of typography in general and it works as a great guide when in doubt
twain's account of his years on the mississippi is part travel book ,  part memoir ,  and part historical work ,  with a few sketches ,  stories ,  and tall tales tossed in for good measure .  there is even an outtake from the not-yet-published  " huckleberry finn ,  "  along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors .  this smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book ,  but much of it shows mark twain at his humorous and humanistic best .the kernel of the volume  ( and its best ,  most cohesive section )  is in chapters 4 through 17 ;  this material appeared in the atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s .  his adventures as a young man are fraught with danger ,  full of comedy ,  populated by a number of ornery ,  mischievous ,  and reckless characters ,  and occasionally embellished  ( although twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn )  .  as twain later wrote in  " puddn'head wilson ,   " if there was anything better in this world than steamboating ,  it was the glory to be got by telling about it .  "after he published the series in the atlantic ,  twain added another 46 chapters ;  much of it an account of his homecoming  ( incognito--or so he'd hoped )  to the mississippi river in 1882 ,  when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad .  many of these descriptions are unusually  ( for twain )  melancholy ;  he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous .  his new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion .the material from other sources ,  unfortunately ,  tends to bog things down--and there are about 10 , 000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices .  twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents ;  he also included travel writing from earlier visitors ,  primarily europeans distracted by how americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty .   ( you almost get the feeling that twain would have smacked  " the once renowned and vigorously hated "  frances trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance ;  she provides twain with the most interesting ,  if snooty ,  descriptions of traveling along the mississippi early in the century .  )the material twain wrote ,  however ,  more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff .  as always ,  he is quotable ,  witty ,  amusing ,  and provocative .  in spite of its excesses ,  nobody has done the mississippi better
what books you would grab as you ran out of a burning house ?  remember that old parlor game ?  this is one on my list .  my copy is stained and spine-cracked and i could not live without it .  it's the standard by which all cookbooks should be measured
glantz punctures both left and right in this balanced analysis of what has gone wrong in iraq .  a powerful story that should be required reading for politicians and political groupies of all leanings
this is truely a funny book .   it of course is the origin of the ma and pa kettle movies ,  yet much more .   i like to pull this one off the shelf every now and again just to be able to chuckle .   when you read it ,  you must remember when it was written and what the racial and political attitudes of the time were ,  although ,   it is a good read on that level too ,  i . e .  seeing were our culture has been and where it is today .   i did read one or two reviews which compaired this work to some of the authors other work .  .  . good grief folks ,  lighten up .  . read the thing for what it is .  . a funny story meant to amuse .  when i was a kid ,  i did not read micky mouse and analyze each comic book for political correctness ,  nor social commentary  ( although ,  being a dog lover ,  i was not always happy how pluto was presented and treated )  nor did i compair the micky of 1949 to the micky of 1952 .   anyway ,  digging into a book like this for those reasons is fine i suppose ,  if you are into such ,  but for me ,  i just enjoyed the read and highly recommend it
when i first started reviewing children's books on amazon . com i gave myself a long list of rules to follow .   and one of those rules stated that i was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until after i'd written my own review .   i wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure ,  filled only with my own thoughts  ( which i obviously mistook to be brilliant )  and feelings .   after a while though i gave up on this rule .   by and large  ( and this is not speaking for all reviews .  .  .  just 90% of them )  a review for a children's book goes something along the lines of  " it was good ,  my four-year-old requests it every night ,  buy this book ,  etc .  "  .   nothing too shocking or revealing .   so i grew lazy .   i started reading other reviews of picture books long before i sat down to actually write a review of my own .   just moments ago i went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book ,   " martin's big words "  .   this book was on my list of must-reads because it had garnered itself a caldecott honor years before .   so i went to the appropriate amazon . com page  ( much as you are now )  and read the first review on the list .   at the time ,  it was an unassuming july 18 ,  2002 review entitled ,   " there's something wrong here .  .  .  "  .   i read the review .   i digested the review .   and i came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones .   ones that i should consider ,  dare i say ,  in my own review .   this is unprecedented .   never has a review for a book ,  a children's book ,  really hit home for me like this one did .   so to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002 ,  i commend you .   and to myself ,  a mental whipping for breaking my own rules .   it's a hard act to follow ,  but i've a point or two of my own to make and i'm gonna make `em .now  as a children's librarian i get a whole heaping helpful of small children coming in around january 17th  ( or just before )  requesting books on martin luther king jr .   for the older children ,  such requests are usually easy enough to fulfill .   but for little ones with short attention spans and even shorter vocabularies ,  the choices are limited .   fortunately ,  there's ,   " martin's big words "  .   a beautiful encapsulation of the life of the great man ,  the book shows martin as a child ,  first encountering the insanity of segregation .   we see him grow up and preach a gospel of love and acceptance .   following this are small looks at the 1955 montgomery bus boycott ,  civil rights marches ,  and his 1964 nobel peace prize .   finally ,  while marching with striking garbage collectors  ( a fact not often mentioned in children's biographies of king )  ,  he was shot and killed .   says the book at the end ,   " his big words are alive for us today "  .the book is stunning to look at ,  you know .   the endpapers consist of pane after pane of brown ,  peach ,  amber ,  and umber stained glass .   taken together ,  the stained glass appears to be a variety of different skin tones all working together to make something beautiful .   using collage ,  illustrator bryan collier peppers his unique style with symbolic images  ( such as four lit candles placed in remembrance of the girls killed in the sixteenth street baptist church )  .   in the rest of the book ,  collier's images leap off the page .   they're bright ,  colorful and eclectic .   combined with author doreen rappaport's elegant eloquent narrative ,  children get a full understanding of the courage and greatness behind dr .  king's life and actions .so what about the complaints of this book ?   let's examine them fully .   first of all ,  one criticism is that in the image of the civil rights march there are thirteen men on display ,  none of whom are either white or female .   this is true .   and it is a little odd .   not don't-buy-this-book odd .   just why-did-the-illustrator-make-that-choice odd .   from looking at the picture i can only assume that collier was working off a snapshot of a portion of a march from the past and didn't notice that it was a bit skewed .   the other criticism of the book is that whites are only portrayed as evil rednecks that want to kill dr .  king .   i dunno .   the book says plenty of things about diversity and the coming together of the races .   as for the lack of positive white images ,  i admit they're not present in this particular book .   however ,  the world is filled to overflowing with books that do present positive images of white people .   as a white person myself ,  i'm sick to death of 'em .   and i'd gladly exchange four or five hundred such books for a single one that was half as beautifully illustrated and written as  " martin's big words "  .so yeah ,  the book has a flaw here or there .   but it also fills a need .   however important you deem it that your children see positive images of whites during the freedom marches is your prerogative .   but don't pass  " martin's big words "  by because it fails to fully display the diversity of the 60s in your eyes .   it's a great book with a great message .   it's also one of the few king bios that'll capture your seven-year-old's attention for longer than a minute .   a great addition to any library and a necessary purchase for anyone who wants to teach their small child about a magnificent man .
after seeing the movie ,  i decided to pick up the book .   this book proved to be very funny ,  as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many ,  many women her age face today .   fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true ,  often serious real-life topics  ( being single and not liking it ,  infidelity ,  betrayal ) and is yet able turn it into light ,  funny reading .   that takes talent ,  in my book .   in the wrong hands ,  this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read ( in light of the above topics )  .   you cant help but root for bridget .i recommend this book and its sequel .   most everyone will get a good laugh out of it
i love this book in conjunction with dr .  perricone's books .  they compliment each other nicely .  a great tweak to feeling and looking better
mind's eye is the second 'eye of the beholder' collection ,  which began as the first comic strip to run in the new york times ,  and provides a fine set of black and white strips which presents a particular viewpoint .  these visual puzzles provide much food for thought :  there are panels of scenes ,  then turn the page for the unifying concept linking them
this is a warm and readable book about a fascinating subject :  what happens at death ,  or near death ?  it is written by a world renowned and respected scholar and medical doctor .  and ,  in spite of the fact that i am a christian ,  with conservative beliefs ,  and even though i maintain my faith carefully focused on god ,  i do nevertheless give the accounts in this book some credence  ( along with its companion ,  written subsequently ,   " life beyond death "  )  .   i invite you to read it and see why
this book was referred to me by one of the author's students .  i have been practicing karuna reiki for several years .   i was thrilled to read this book .  the author has introduced many specific healing techniques and symbol combinations that have produced amazing results for my clients .   she obviously has an incredible passion for karuna reiki because the book reads as if the energy itself wrote every word .
a moving and inspiring portrait of men most people will never know about but will always be remembered by those touched by their deeds and courage in places we don't remember much anymore .  i am thankful for the sacrifice they made so i could freely write this
i have been a fan of larry gonick`s work for years ever since i first stumbled onto his cartoon guide to statistics .   he covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically .   innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line .   it was this historical approach that made carl sagan's cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science .i have long said that we teach science backward .   we still teach on a 19th century model .   we start with biology ,  then chemistry ,  and finally physics .even when i was in high school ,  i wished that i could take physics before chemistry .   before i was elected as a school board director ,  i was on our district's gifted advisory council .   i made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and ,  then ,  biology last .   i was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics .   so why not teach the math along with the science ?   integrate it .    ( no ,  that would make it too relevant .  )i felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a nobel laureate making the same assertion that i had been making for years-we teach science backwards .   after all ,  the toughest course out there is biochemistry-at least that is what every med student i know has ever said .   and biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster innovations-nano-technology not being the least of these frontiers .gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first ,  because in this book on chemistry ,  he introduces quantum mechanics ,  which is normally taught as physics ,  on page 28 .don't let he word  " cartoon "  in larry gonick`s books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved .   he makes each subject accessible while being entertaining ,  but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject .so when i needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping ,  it took me about thirty seconds to find my book .   i went right to larry gonick
raskolnikov ,  an impovershed student in 19th century st .  petersburg ,  conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker .  he justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse .  the world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education .  killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes .  after all ,  the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society .  the crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with raskolnikov's angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering .  almost every major character in the book is more likeable that raskolnikov .the philosophy of dostoyevsky's book seems to be primarily a refutation of hegelian and proto-nietschian philosophy and an affirmation of christian values .  along the way he also manages to work in a rebuttal of social-darwinism .having known ,  prosecuted ,  and defended hundreds of murderers ,  i was much taken by raskolnikov's psychological progression from crime to atonement .  much of his self justification rang true to my experience .  i have known many killers who thought of themselves as superior beings above the law ,  and many others who justified killing on the grounds that the victim lacked human worth .  so long as the killer can keep the victim dehumanized ,  the killer can live with the deed .  when the killer begins to regard the victim as a fellow human ,  guilt sets in and many confess--often years later .  raskolnikov's behavioural symptoms did not ,  however ,  ring true to my experience .  although some killers are guilt-ridden to the point of distraction ,  they can usually control themselves much better than raskolnikov .  his actions practically shouted his guilt .the interplay of the large cast of characters gave the book great psychological depth ,  but dostoyevsky didn't beat the reader over the head with the psychology .   he didn't tell you what the characters were thinking .   their actions showed you what they were thinking .  in my experience ,  most modern psycho-dramas ladle out the psychology in huge dollops .  modern writers would do well to re-read dostoyevsky .the abridged audio edition read by michael sheen is three hours long ,  and the tale does not suffer much from the massive abridgement necessary to get the story on three cd's .   my greatest complaint with the edition is that sheen reads the story with a british accent ,  and the characters all speak with british accents .   it was somewhat hard to adjust to a russian novel read with a british accent .
" underground education "  does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective ,  as is perhaps implied by the title .  but rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past .  some of the historical figures are famous ,  such as george washington and cleopatra .  while others ,  like the several female serial killers discussed ,  are more obscure .  the book is divided into 10 chapters ,  including the arts ,  religion ,  science and sex .  actually ,  this book reminds me somewhat of the  " people's almanac "  series written by david wallechinsky .  but here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse .  it's a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge .  but some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover .  still it is a worthwhile purchase .
part geology ,  part biography ,  part history of scotland ,  this excellent book is a tribute to james hutton ,  the originator of modern geology .  starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth ,  the author weaves the intriguing story of james hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth's true antiquity .  the political situation in eighteenth century scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which hutton lived .  but the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after hutton's death is also discussed ,  ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them .  this is a very well-written and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience
this is the sixth and final addition to the author's excellent holiday time series ,  just in time for rosh hashanah !  as in the other titles ,   ( it's challah time !  it's seder time !  etc .  )  tod cohen's full-color photos capture the joyousness of the children as they learn to celebrate the holiday wearing new clothes ,  making jewish new year's cards for their families ,  tasting new foods such as pomegranates and star fruits ,  and blowing the shofar .  the sounds of the shofar are explained in easy ,  understandable terms for this young age level .  the children are also shown learning such things as tying their shoes and writing their names .   the brief amount of text on each page and very appealing children pictured learning to make round challot and blow the shofar make this just right for using with pre-schoolers ,  their parents ,  and in the classroom .  included is an easy shofar craft and a brief paragraph about rosh hashanah .  recommended for all jewish libraries .  ages :  4-6 .   reviewed by andrea davidso
angels was the smallest college in cambridge .   it was  built at the beginning of the 15th century .   fairly had a fellowship .   st .  angelicus students had to find their own lodgings .   fred fairly had taken the science tripos and received a first class degree .   he came from a rectory and so his material wants were limited .   he was used to making do .  at the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a christian .   fred knew the country was not a place of peace .   the rectory had been built in 1830 .daisy saunders wanted to know how the human body worked and applied for nursing training .   she was seventeen and her mother had died recently and she was free to live away from home .   daisy ,  now known as saunders ,  was a probationer during her first year .   she was told to keep her eye on james elder ,  an attempted suicide via the thames .   it was january 1912 .   to all the patients ,  except for the dying ,  food was of paramount importance .   elder refused to eat .   the constable had said he was a gentleman .   he asked daisy if the incident had appeared in the press .   for arranging for a notice about elder's conduct in the newpaper ,  daisy was dismissed .fred fairly and daisy were in an accident with bicycles .   a good samaritan thought they were married to each other and put them to bed together in the spare room to regain their health .   fred was enchanted and afterwards he looked everywhere to locate daisy .   the kindness of the wrayburns ,  the samaritans ,  gave daisy a place to stay in cambridge .   she would do work in the house in exchange for room and board .   she had traveled to cambridge to find work in a private hospital .   happily daisy was employed at the mental hospital and fred found her again at the wrayburns' .   they went for a walk in the country .   fred asked daisy to marry him .   mr .  wrayburn told daisy that fred could not be a junior fellow if he married .in the trial ,  pertaining to the accident ,  the journalist ,  who had accompanied daisy to cambridge ,  was able to identify the man who drove the horse cart wildly causing the accident .   when the heart is broken ,  efficiency is impaired .   there was some suggestion in the testimony of the journalist that daisy had been or would have been used ,  but for the happening of the accident .   daisy had to leave the wrayburns and cambridge because of what was disclosed in court .   leaving her lodgings ,  she was free at last to cry over the hurt she had caused fred .   daisy and fred passed each other on her way to the train station .   we do not know what action ,  if any ,  resulted .both of the young characters are portrayed as having beautiful consciences .   the writing is elegant .
the plot :  after an emotional burnout ,  both elias winters and charity truitt are ready for a change .  each ends up moving to whispering waters cove and operating a shop on crazy otis landing .  the two are instantly attracted and end up investigating a murder together .i've read this book twice .  initially ,  i was disappointed in this book .  i had just finished reading several other jak novels .  similar plots ,  similar characters with similar backgrounds  .   .  .  .  reading this a second time without the jak marathon ,  i found it an enjoyable read .  the characters are likable and respectable .  good mystery .  amusing read
" lords of the earth "  is the term the yali warriors use to describe themselves .   they live in the heluk valley in irian jaya ,  and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains .   the first section of the book is about them ,  their customs ,  and the awful fear and darkness they lived in .   don richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin ,  and longing for release .   the horror of their pain is graphic ,  and not suitable to be read to younger children .the second part of the book describes the early life of stan dale ,  his conversion ,  and his burden for those in darkness .   he is drawn as a determined man ,  physically strong and fit ,  with firm convictions .the book goes on to tell of stan's coming to the yali people .   how a strange story begins over his identity ,  protecting his life .   how the first few yali christians were killed ,  and later stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered .   how another missionary family died in a plane crash ,  except for the nine-year-old son ,  whose friendship with the yali paves the way for them to turn to christ .the book reminded me christ's words in john 12 : 24 ,   " verily ,  verily ,  i say unto you ,  except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die ,  it abideth alone :  but if it die ,  it bringeth forth much fruit .  "   on earth ,  stan dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth ,  but he will rejoice in heaven with the yali that are there through his witness .
to put this review into perspective for you ,  it is written by a serious student of cooking that has been actively studying food on their own for 25 years .   i have been focusing on italian food for the last 10 years .   my favorite cookbook is  " the professional chef "  by the culinary institute of america .if you are a serious home cook you will love this book .the photography in this book is nice and the food styling is beautiful .  if you love to entertain and/or you want the meals you serve your family and friends to be gorgeous you will get so many ideas reading this book .the directions for the recipes are very thorough and well written .   i believe that a serious beginner could follow these recipes without a problem .i have tried many of the recipes in this book all to rave reviews .   i particularly enjoyed the chapter on foams .  the  " cream whippers "  are expensive ,  but they are extremely fun to use .this book does not need to be used just for small bites .   it is as simple as just making fewer portions from the same recipe .this book is highly recommended for anyone that is serious about cooking .
as a visual arts student coming to terms with the whole conceptual ideology in contemporary art ,  i found this book an excellent choice for delving into the theoretical side of contemporary photgraphy .  this book is definitely not bedtime reading .   trust me ,  i tried it and kept myself awake !  there is also an excellent reference to archives ,  journals and other books to peruse .   i found the book easy to understand and has helped me immensely in my quest to understand what constitutes visual art in current times .  an excellent choice for all those contemplating a visual arts career using photographic image
i was at the sfmoma to see her yes exhibition ,  and exactly what i expected ,  i was overwhelmed with delight .  .  .  her art is whimsically amazing .  her music touches your heart and soul .  seeing all the people there that day ,  i was glad that yoko is finally getting all the respect she deserves ,  after all these years .  .  .  also caught her live performance at the los angeles's roxy almost 6 years ago just took my breath away .  i truly think she's one of the true visionaries of our time
this is the sort of book i have been looking for a long time .  i've read other books on the middle east which purport to have a similar focus ,  but which are instead incomplete ,  notably  " sowing the wind "  .  this book ,  by contrast ,  maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region .  it looks as if the book was written as a textbook for  ( i would presume )  grad students studying the subject ,  but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal .an issue with a book like this is the tone of the work ,  how well the author writes .  kamrava isn't the second coming of hemingway ,  but he's not too bad ,  either .  the book is divided into two portions :  first ,  a historical section that gives you an overview of the region's history ,  and second a topical section that looks at various issues that impact the region currently .  the first section is very readable ,  the second less so  ( who actually enjoys reading about economics ?  )  .  the author ,  however ,  does a good job  ( for the most part )  of not sounding like a university professor telling you about something ,  though he does occasionally use words that are obscure ,  especially in terms of sub-regions of the mid east .i still enjoyed this book ,  thought i got a lot out of it ,  and would recommend it .  the author seems to be a hair more optimistic about the prospects for peace and prosperity in the region than i am ,  but he makes a good case for his point of view ,  and the result is interesting
for those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one ,  you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages .   statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through .   the writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of china and its muscle power .   instead of branding china as a villain ,  we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains ,  china wouldn't be where it is now .   wal-mart is covered in detail .   the writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing ,  it's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when china has perfected its manufacturing bases just as japan and south korea had done before it .   then ,  there's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located ,  and how china is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour .   china's progress isn't simply detrimental to other countries .   on contrary ,  it benefits them as well .   for example ,  australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to china .   with increase of living standard in china ,  chinese needs more nutritious food .   as china couldn't provide enough ,  united states particularly the middle states are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the middle kingdom .   then ,  there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping united states in check by siding with china ,  and also the love and hate relationship between usa and china of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in china and so forth .   whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided  ( since china has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time )  ,  suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks .   yes ,  some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately ,  i think they are missing the points .   what's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about china and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come .   highly recommended
if you are into cooking than this is the book you must have .this is not another recipe book but a complete culinary referance for both novice cook and expert
if you are ready to take complete responsibility for yourself and live the joyful life then this is a must read .  i will say it is simple even thou i will avoid saying it is easy .  for your sake and your loved ones sake give this idea a go .
i just finished reading the hitorian .  the first 400 pages were so compelling ,  that i could hardly put it down .  then .  .  .  .  .  it became soooo boring .  it literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400 .  i just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head ,  thinking this has to get better ,  considering how good the first 2/3rd's were .i also have to say that i was disappointed with the ending - it was way too contrived for me .  .  .  spoiler alert*** - i found it extremely unbelievable that dracula would 'assume' that helen died in the fall and not gone after her ,  as the author states when helen is recounting how she made it out alive from the fall .  i mean ,  come on .  .  .  dracula is supposedly all knowing and has tracked this woman all over the world .  now were supposed to believe that he simply says  " damn ,  she fell - i guess after all i've been through ,  i won't bother to check - i'll just find another victim "  - sorry ,  didn't buy it and it really was a big let down after so much potential in the beginning .  .overall ,  the book was really great .  fascinating reading for the dracula fan .  just wish the ending held up to the beginning .
i think this is harriet lerner's best book .  i has the clearest and most helpful chapter on family secrets that i've ever read .  the chapter called &quot ; a funny thing happened on the way to the orifice&quot ;  is worth the price of the book .  the chapter on affairs ,  even though controversial ,  should be helpful to all couples ,  especially if you think your partner will never cheat on you
this is one of those life changing books .   i first came across this while looking midlessly through my local  " spiritual "  bookstore and ended up reading the entire thing in the next two hours .as a fast read ,  with a simple ,  concise message ,  this book lacks nothing .   it isn't dated ,  unless you consider religion or spiritual ideas dated .   richard bach creates a story that can effect you as much or as little as you want- but it teaches the precepts of becoming a messiah yourself and helps you to view jesus ,  christianity ,  god ,  and yourself in a brand new light .needless to say ,  this is a five out of five .   buy it today and then give it away
this book was mind expanding ,  and told a great story of exploring the facets of one's personality and how much that personality is interdependent with his wife and others .  my favorite part was the story of the  " golden pages "  where a person is taught by the wise man that truth of man's existence is inspiring and worthy of discovery ,  but to share that truth with others is subjecting oneself to ridicule and criticsm ,  if not war
this book is for lovers of robicheaux .   his demons seem put to rest ,  redemption seems almost within his grasp - and yet the worst mayhem ever occurs within these pages .   the poetry and sense of regret for lost innocence pervade burke's prose as always ,  but his anger at humanity's shortcomings is bubbling volcanically just beneath the surface .   hurricane katrina features as a force both of destruction and cleansing .   a bit like robicheaux himsel
a jules vernes classic ,  this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time .   true ,  there are some items that may seem a bit dated ,  and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible .   yet ,  this novel is still a joy to read .with a stoic icelander as their guide ,  a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the arctic ,  as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist .   contrary to popular belief  ( and scientific reality )  ,  the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth ,  which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno .   i won't serve as spoiler ,  but sufficed to say ,  that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth .vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint .   their instruments ,  a crude electric light and others ,  would be considered state-of-the art for their time .   vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth .   vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body .   and if you take verne's theories to heart  ( although modern science refutes them )  ,  their journey is plausible .however ,  i do have a couple minor gripes .   vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations ,  which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel .   although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist ,  the rest of the masses  ( myself included )  probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line .   also ,  there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with vernes logic .  during their rapid ascent  ( the details i won't reveal )  ,  the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness  ( a . k . a .  ,   " the bends "  )  .   although it was still a new phenomena at the time ,  i believe vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure ,  as he did during their slow descent into the abyss .the nitpicking aside ,  this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time .   a modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at verne's vision of a subterranean world .   nearly a century and a half later ,  vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination
every page is an eye opener .   the author has done an excellent job revealing the side of hillary that has so long been hidden .i think america could do better by picking a different first woman president .  someone with some morals and a love of our country .  she has neither .  it is an important  " first "  that should withstand the test of time .  historians are going to have a field day writing all the trash these two are involved in .her mothering skills reveal a great deal about her character .  her child was always placed last .  the only time hillary showed any family unity was when it was necessary for the media to put her in a positive light .how did these two gain so much wealth in such a short amount of time ?   they did not even own property when  " they "  became president .   there are still a lot of questions to be answered ,  and many more books to be written about this family .8 years of these two is quite enough .
i could not put this book down !   i was so amazed with this shocking story that i bought several copies for gifts .   reading this book was like watching a scary movie .
we're all getting old and fat !  this book just makes you feel less alone about the ordeal
this book will be invaluable now as i am going to groom my dog myself .  the instructions are easily understood
it is not often i reread a book but this was well worth it .  it is the true story of a &quot ; cracker&quot ;  who set about trying to break into computer networks and how people from system administrators to the fbi try to stop him .  written in the style of a thriller ,  you are swept along in amazement at the exploits of the cracker .  if this doesn't alter your view of internet security nothing will .  on the down side it becomes a chore trying to keep all the players straight in one's head ,  it is indeed a cast of many .  although somewhat geeky at times and it does help to have some background in computer networking it won't prevent you from enjoying what is surely the most bizarre story of internet hacking you will read
born to kvetch is ,  at one time ,  informative ,  enlightening ,  synical ,  humorous ,  and irreligious .   i learned so much about the yiddish language ,  jewish mores and their beginnings ,  jewish and yiddish history and interpersonal relations .   at times i was in tears of laughter or a tear of sadness ;  amazed or embarrassed and often shocked by michael wex's irreverence .loved it all
although i have been writing code for a few years ,  this was my first foray into ai programming .  i find the examples easy to understand .  everything is very well written and the example code is well documented .  i could not have asked for a better book .
i really enjoyed this book .  it was a few good laughs over a few good dumps .  what else can a goomba ask from a book sittin' on the back of the cammode
i just finished reading the handyman's dream ,  by nick poff .  i was completely blown away !  this is a great book .  its about 2 guys who meet one another in small town indiana .  after the first chapter you will want to have these fellas over for dinner .  the story is very well written and has alot of innovative things in it that i havent seen in any other gay novels .  i love the way the author integrates music and songs into the story .  from the character norma  (  ed's mother ) and her quirky comebacks to the wonderful mrs .  penfield ,  the novel will have you laughing and will touch a place deep inside you that few books do .  this story also tells of the fears and struggles a gay couple had in the past ,  and one many still have today .  i love the fact that its very g rated and a good read for not only gay folks but also straight folks .  .  . anyone who believes in the power of love .  i wish while growing up i would have had a book like this one to show me that there is such a thing as good  ,  healthy gay relationships .   i highly recommend the handyman's dream .
the story of anne continues with this work and the author stays true to her style ,  story line and character developement .   this ,  like the other books in this series ,  have a rather timeless nature about them and a comforting charm .   the reader ,  of course ,  must remember the time they were written and the style and syntax used at that time .   from my own point of view ,  this is great .   i enjoy this type of writing and certainly enjoy ms .  montgomery's story telling abilities .   in this work ,  anne goes off to redman college and her adventure continues .   recommend these books for readers of all ages .   wish there were more works out there like it .
every now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator .    the mid-first century of rome was such a time and tacitus was such a communicator .   the histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history .    the historian will do well to read tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity .    while observing and commenting on the human element in history ,  tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil ,  wars ,  and rumors of wars .   his beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity .   his example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow .a word on this translation in particular - i found mr .  wellesley's translation very readable and poetic .   he seems to have captured the literature value of the text as well as the content .   well done
in order to properly understand the jesus of the new testament ,  instead of making a jesus of our own liking ,  it is necessary to understand jesus as he himself indicated .   jesus himself ,  according to the new testament ,  made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures ,   (  old testament  )  ,  as he sought to explain himself ,  his actions ,  his teachings and his significance .   understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what jesus was and is about .  this means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews .   understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it ,  and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole .   christopher wright's book ,  knowing jesus through the old testament ,  is an absolute godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the jesus of the new testament .   this book is a little bit technical at times ,  it is not a devotional work ,  but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of jesus ,  thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of jesus according to the background that jesus himself referred to .     thanks chris wright for this fabulous book .  also see his forthcoming book ,  the mission of god ,  due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press .  it looks to be another bullseye !  !   for some other great little books on jesus that are sane and sober ,  see :   jesus and his world by peter walker ,   the original jesus by n . t .  wright ,  and for a bit of a larger work see jesus and the gospels by craig blomberg
like pretty much anything in which neil's involved ,  this a fine and useful work .  the reviews of teddy millon's axis ii taxonomic extensions are worth most of the considerable price of admission here all by themselves .  but after 30 years in the field ,  i'll warn any newcomers that getting any too rigid with treatment plan rollouts will make you as nuts at the people you're treating .as -guidelines- with notions about starting points and signposts along the way ,  however ,  these are very useful .  neil's six-step treatment outline seems a bit oddly ordered ,  and i wasn't able to find a rationale for determining diagnosis in the final step  ( when you have to lay one on the client's payment guarantor at the outset )  .  but otherwise ,  the six steps are another handy construction among several now available .if you're fairly new in the field ,  this will be a real handy reference ,  but don't stake the clients' lives  ( or your own serenity )  on this when they start to go refractive .
i am from yazoo city so this book has always been one of my favorites .  i saw willie morris at a car wash in jackson ,  ms not long before his death .  i was shy and didn't want to bother him ,  so i didn't introduce myself and have a chat .  i would have loved to have spoken with him .  now i regret my shyness - should've taken the chance .  yazoo city has an enduring quality and charm that shows in all his books and stories .  no matter where i live ,  it will always be home .  there is a great feeling of safety and warmth whenever i drive into the city limits .  it is a feeling of home .  not many people have that sense of home these days .  i feel blessed to have grown up there
i read this book five years ago ,  when i was a manager leading a small company about 15 people .  i  honour management style that respect human nature .  deming's priciples presented in this book give me a systematic  insight of the principles based on mutual trusting and respect .  i used his  approach -- our company makes good profit -- and more important ,  all the  staff enjoy working in our company
if you're into reading memoirs ,  this is exceptional .   her clarity of thought and her ability to portray her feelings into words is unsurpassed ,  in my opinion .   i enjoy her prose so very much .   i can find myself relating to so many of her feelings and thoughts despite the difference of age and time .   this is a great read
there are many books out there about the supposed strengths or weaknesses of globalization and free trade ,  but at least in terms of the international movement of capital ,  you'll usually find mere boosterism and ideology .  at last ,  paul blustein has given us a look at the real-life effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation .  here we have an in-depth and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of argentina's economy in 2001-2002 ,  which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship .  you won't be surprised to see the word  " bubble "  regularly ,  as blustein covers the surprisingly slow-moving factors that added up to disaster over several years ,  with many mistakes made by all parties along the way .in addition to some financial mismanagement and damaging internal politics within argentina itself ,  blustein also explains errors made by the imf and the clinton and bush administrations ,  and unhealthy speculation by foreign investors who had no regard for the outcomes of their actions .  not to mention ,  argentina was the punching bag for an international monetary system that is built to ensure short-term rewards for speculators ,  plus an ideology that believes it to be acceptable when elites in rich countries profit while regular people in developing nations are left holding the bag when the bubble bursts .  i would also recommend this book for those with a general interest in international monetary matters ,  as bluestein does a marvelous job explaining phenomena like currency exchange rates ,  international debt and equity markets ,  and other financial concepts that you may wish to understand more deeply .  if you're an ideologue in love with the supposed panacea of free markets ,  thinking that the unfettered movement of capital around the world will raise all ships ,  you might have your worldview shot down by blustein and his excellent look at argentina's misery .

i bought this for my classroom bookshelf .  i teach 7th grade science and my kids fight with each other to read it
this book should be a mandatory read for every parent & parent to be .   what an eye opener !  !  !   this book gives you things to look for in predators .  .  . how they operate .   there are comments from real predators as well as victims .   the book can be difficult to read at times .   people are truly sick !   but it gives parents power in what to look for & how talk to your child ( ren )  .   must read !
" de-mystifying "  a musical genre is a favorite practice of many historians ,  educators ,  and musicians ,  and has been overdone .  unlike them ,  but not unlike a master performer ,  palmer is able to strike a balance between technique ,  feeling ,  and authenticity :  he is historically and musically adept without denying the blues its inherent mystery and evocative nuance .palmer put his life into this work and it shows ;  he without a doubt  " convinces "  .  i highly recommend his deep blues .
this is not the book for you if you're impatient with precision and specifics ;  if you want good results ,  you'll do what michael recchiuti tells you to do .  you'll buy the higher-butterfat butter ,  you'll use the scharffen-berger or valrhona and chuck the hershey's ,  and you'll be so glad you did ,  because every recipe --and i mean every single one of the seven or eight recipes i have tried from this book thus far-- has been fantastic .i would not call this a good beginner's cookbook ,  though the photography is gorgeous enough to qualify this as a coffee table book even for those who don't want to get in the kitchen .  some baking experience is helpful ,  as is a well-equipped kitchen  ( stand-mixer ,  immersion blender ,  heavy-bottomed pots for sauces etc )  .   this is an outstanding book and i highly recommend it .
i read this book after the authors  ( scott & omari )  told me about it on one of the public forums  ( about gmat )  .  excellent book ,  it's gives the overall picture of what an mba candidate should look like to an admission officer at the b school .  it definitely gives you an edge .  this is book is like 'everything about b school applications in a nutshell' .there are some methods like drawing a 'grid' to see where you stand ,  really gives insight into what are your strenghts & the areas you should improve or 'cover' in the application essays .overall ,  not the one & only but very good book .
we see a phrase a lot when we visit how-to sites for writers .  world building .  by this ,  we mean the setting ,  the characters ,  and everything else where our story will occur .  for me ,  this often means maps ,  memories and visits ,  since i write about where i live .  but if you'd like to see exactly what  " world building "  means ,  head down to your local library and grab salem's lot by stephen king .yeah ,  that's right ,  i'm reviewing a book by stephen king .  as if his career really needs my help .( i bought my copy at foreign language bookstore on yanan lu in hangzhou ,  with a new introduction that is a pleasure to read ,  but i mentioned the library to save you some money .  )when stephen king mania first gripped the english-speaking world ,  i missed it .  i saw the film of carrie and hated it .  years later ,  at a guard desk on a long shift ,  scheduled so suddenly that i hadn't had a chance to visit the library ,  i read what was in the desk instead .  thinner .  if i were stephen king ,  i'd have put a pen name on that crap as well .one of king's fans brought me around .  she recommended the shining .  of course i thought of that kubrick/nicholson travesty .  no no ,  she said ,  read the book .  it's much different .  yes ,  it is .  it's fantastic for its perceptiveness .  next up ,  pet sematary ,  which scared the crap out of me .  and that ,  my friends ,  is not easy .on writing .  i've gushed about that enough times .  the films stand by me and the apt pupil .  so ,  in the end ,  i appreciate king and forgive him for carrie ,  and i think he's forgiven himself .  we won't talk about the richard bachman alias ,  although the film of the running man was fun in a stupid sort of way .salem's lot .  king's second book ,  and perhaps it should have been his first .  i've been in china since 1999 .  if i ever want to visit a town in the us ,  i don't need a plane ticket .  i can just real salem's lot .  consider it a clinic on world building .  these are the places and the people i left behind ,  right there ,  recorded by a master .  well ,  except for the vampire .  i don't recall seeing him in watha .  maybe he moved into my old house .actually ,  that's stephen king right there .  he creates an entirely real world ,  then throws in something unusual because it makes the story move and because he just thinks it's cool .  a vampire here ,  a rabid dog there ,  a mind reader over there ,  a ufo crashing into hickville .  .  .nobody has defended stephen king by mentioning that william shakespeare trucked heavily with ghosts and witches and prophesies in his stories ,  so i'll limit myself to a single sentence .i believe that ,  just as i studied mary shelley's frankenstein in a literature class ,  one day students will study stephen king .  just nothing about cars that come to life ,  because those stories really suck .  i will accuse stephen king of being uneven ,  and he explains why in on writing .  but at his best ,  i recommend him highly .oh ,  and here's a weird bit of trivia .  i recognized the scene on page 50 .  nothing before it ,  nothing after it ,  just that one bit .  so i at least began reading this book .  probably at a guard desk .  tampa ,  florida ,  has excellent libraries .  at my guard desk ,  when i wasn't writing ,  i was getting drunk on literature ,  and i can't possibly remember it all .  but i think salem's lot by stephen king plus the thanatos syndrome by walker percy spurred me to write the demons within ,  which i later threw out but which gave descent into madness its back story .( for madman trivia buffs :  terrence and sandra howell once had their own novel .  it really sucked .  terrence had his own novel 15 years before that .  it also sucked .  he's a composite of two classmates ,  terrence cram and ricky howell ,  so i'm glad he finally showed up in some form .  )in on writing ,  stephen king tells us that he was so drunk and stoned at one point that he can't remember writing some of his books .  it seems i was so high on literature at one point that i forgot entire books i read ,  including salem's lot .  so ,  i guess that getting old does have its advantages .
i originally bought this for my almost-2-year-old because i wanted him to have a new alphabet book with both upper and lower case letters shown  ( there are not many out there besides chicka chicka boom boom )  .  instead it has become a favorite of my three year old who already knows her letters .  the reason :  this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter .  some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging .  it is a beautiful book that provides  " i spy "  and  " where's waldo "  type challenges .  i highly recommend this book for the 1-5 crowd
this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on  " death row ,  "  at least in the state of mississippi ,  and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences .   it touches on activities of the ku klux klan .  it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty .   however ,  some sympathy is found for the victims of crime .   the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime .   sam's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from  " death row .  "  the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution .   meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison's chaplain .i found it to be one of the better john grisham books .
national geographic magazine has long been recognized for the quality of its color photographs by its brilliant staff of photographers who manage to go to places both known and unknown and open vistas of other cultures ,  other peoples ,  other landscapes .   in this very large and exceptionally affordable volume are some of ng's finest images plus many dazzling photographs not previously published in the magazine .  the result is a panorama of the world as few other books can supply .covering nearly all the countries of the world ,  wide angle uses its descriptor to unfold some remarkable images of fields and terrain and the peoples who inhabit them ,  all composed beautifully with ngs typical 'hidden camera' technique .   this is a travel volume for those who plan to visit the out of the ordinary places as  well as a scrapbook for those who have been to the more accessible places ,  but is it more :  this is a closer look at the planet we inhabit that is so magnificent  it urges us by images alone to protect the beauty we threaten to destroy .   recommended .  grady harp ,  january 06
my daughter received this book for her 7th birthday .   she loves all  the details and can read it over and over again .   these pop-ups are amazing !   i would highly recommend this book to anyone with a little princess of their own .
another beautiful contribution by this author .  love letters to make you weep ,  smile ,  laugh and imagine  .   .   .  or remember  .   .   .   how it feels to love and be loved

haccp is the acronym for hazard analysis of critical control points .  this text ,  by arduser and brown is the be all and end all on the topic - in my view .   it even comes with a companion cd-rom that contains all forms from the book in adobe acrobat  ( pdf )  and ms word format .  this is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired .the comprehensive 530+ page text covers everything i can think of that relates to food safety in restaurants and other eateries .  it is designed to teach food service managers and their employees the specifics of food safety in accordance with the fda food code .  this excellent training manual is in large print format that makes it easy to read .  the writing is easy to understand and the authors were careful to explain key concepts and terms so that even a novice can study it alone .the seven comprehensive chapters in the manual cover the following topics :  hazards to food safety ;  factors affecting food-born illness ;  food safety regulations ;  following the flow of food ;  haccp ;  and the facility plan .  these are followed by an extremely helpful glossary of terms .  the appendix includes all forms needed to meet the fda requirements and to run an efficient and safe establishment .  included are checklists ,  signage ,  compliance checklists ,  and equipment cleaning charts ,  allergen-control program worksheet along with job descriptions for personnel .  there is even a certificate of completion to certify that staff members have taken and passed the required tests  ( included )  .with the rise in reports of food-borne illnesses and deaths it is essential that every food service operation adhere to the regulations and safety procedures at all times .   in my view ,  this book is essential to ensure you are in total compliance .as one who has conducted training i find this book deserves 5 stars for its complete coverage of the subject matter in an easy to digest all-in-one format .   i highly recommend this book
we got this book out from our library recently and within a week i had ordered a copy for us .   my nearly 2 year old demands poems from it all the time  ( as only 2 year olds can demand !  !  )  and her older brothers have also enjoyed them .   the book has so many poems that struck a chord with us ;  just one small example :  with recent cold weather i ended up sharing dragon smoke  ( about day being so cold you can see your own breath )  with my oldest son's class at school .  i have also suggested that our local pre-school buys a copy for the adult library so that the poems can be shared with the children when relevant themes / moments arise .   the pictures are perfect for the poems creating a completely wonderful package .  it is just an absolutely superb book and one i will be buying as a present for many other families .   i think in a way the title is a bit of a pity ,   ( although completly reasonable )  ,  as these poems will last a lot longer than just for the  " very young "
i actually enjoyed this book very much .   i was in a romance slump and needed something different .   well ,  i got it .there is no need to give a synopsis of the story -- my predecessors have done an excellent job .   the only thing i really want to say is that i really ,  really liked muriel and edward ,  the dog .
i picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching mystic river ,  the film based on another lehane novel .  darkness ,  take my hand did not disappoint .  different characters ,  same setting ,  and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil .  lehane's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing ,  a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic  ,  hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre .  lehane's descriptions jump right off the page at you .  his characters are so human ,  so intense ,  their dialogue so sharp ,  that it's almost like watching a movie in your mind .  there isn't a wasted word in this book .  the suspense starts to build on page 1 ,  and never lets up ,  becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter .  this is a stay-up-late read to finish only when you're not alone in the night .lehane's other works top my summer reading list .  i'd love to see what he could do in a different genre
terrier will not disappoint tamora pierce fans !   the narration is done through first person ,  told as a journal .   this is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story ,  and difficult to account for actions the narrator hasn't seen .  but tamora has performed her usual magic ,  snatching up the readers' interest from the first page and holding it until the last  ( i even read all of the notes pages and the bio )  .   readers may find it difficult to put down .   once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo
i have always been intrigued with the hells angels and this book answered many questions especially the history of the club .  i was impressed that the author lived with them for a year .
this was an amazing book .   it was one of those where when you read it ,  you can picture the story in your head ,  almost movie like .   feist did an amazing job with descriptions and character developement .   this was my first fiest book ,  but i can guarantee you ,  it wont be my last .the plot follows a young boy named kieli and his story of becoming a spy and weapon against those that murdered his village .  the story begins with kieli on a vision quest ,  a test to prove he is ready to be an adult .   he must go to a sacred hill and wait for a vision to appear to him .   he then finds that his village has been attacked and that he is the sole remainer of his people .   the story goes on to tell of his quest for vengance and his plot of revenge .amazing in every way
i handsold so many copies of this book that my local bookstore accused me of emptying out the warehouse so they couldn't order any more .   reid strives for a journalistic impartiality here but he is so excited by the current evolution of political life in europe that he carries you along .   i especially love the story of little portugal ,  which has unilaterally decided that drugs are no longer a criminal matter but a medical one .   the us could learn from that example ,  and from many other european examples in this book .   when you read the story about ge and honeywell ,  you'll realize we're going to have to ,  because they're going to teach us whether we want to learn or not
michael haller's life revolves around criminal defense ,  his an attorney operating out the back of his lincoln town car .  his appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy ,  people either called him mick or mickey .  tall ,  dark and intelligent with his good looks and irish blood lines made him a catch .  in the court room he was very together with great timing ,  in his personal life it was a mess ,  at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter .  his father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney ;  another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to ,  his father wrote books and practised law that didn't have room for innocent clients ,  so far mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just wouldn't recognize innocence if it came along .  being an independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll ,  he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who couldn't afford to pay his fees .  in total he kept four lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour ,  what he was really looking for was a franchise player ,  a case to keep the cash rolling ,  point blank a meal ticket .louis ross roulet dealt in la property he was a rich playboy ,  currently booked on charges of ag-assault ,  gbi ,  and attempted rape ,  and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court .  mickey couldn't believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook .  this was all too easy ,  in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case .  just as he was on a roll mickey's close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just didn't sit right ,  in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil .this is the first time in a long time that i have picked up a book based on a court room drama ;  but this book is much more than just that .  michael connelly has done a wonderful job ;  his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through ;  well written and easy to follow so you don't get lost in the jargon of law ,  especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the us law system .  i'm hoping very much that mr .  connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer mickey haller in other books going forward ,  congratulations to michael connelly for a rollercoaster read .a . bowhil
as an overweight ,  stressed-out ,  40-something professional ,  i am thrilled to find this book !   the spark is exactly what i needed to get my body moving again .   i am one of those who had fallen for the 1-hour a day exercise trap ,  and if i didn't have an hour ,  which i usually don't ,  i just didn't exercise .   i love doing my three to four sparks a day ,  knowing i am doing my body far more good than waiting for that elusive day when i can fit in 45 minutes or more for my workout .   this is a wonderful concept ,  and so doable !  it's working !  !  thank you
i would strongly recommend that anyone interested in this book read the review of this book by m .  goldin on h- net . it is comprehensive and comes from someone who served in an armed forces combat unit during the second world war .this book chronicles the negative and prejudiced attitudes held by various figures of the army throughout the past century .these attitudes may have been  important in effecting the lives of individual soldiers at the unit level .they too may have had certain effect on overall u . s .  policy in such matters as bombing the rail lines into auschwitz .there were also efforts to influence negatively american attitudes towards the emerging jewish state in israel .this is in a way a sad and yet important book to read .  it chronicles how that fundamental american ideal of equal treatment of the individual human being was violated by prejudice ,  and ignorance .
i love historical fiction ,  and the march was one of the better historical novels that i've read .  the characters are well-drawn ,  and the action moves along briskly ,  with no dead spots .   the civil war background seemed very authentic ,  and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions ,  the march blends the two to show that war really is hell .doctorow is an excellent writer ,  and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable .   my only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue .   that's not true ,  as studies of union soldiers' letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members ,  or for other reasons than just slavery .   that also applies to confederate soldiers .   a minor quibble that doesn't really hurt the book ,  but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real ,  documented historical fact .highly recommended
this book is like a long short story that centers around danny and a period that he is at yale .   he and his friends are preparing for a big party .   the book goes on to follow danny as he tries to start a relationship with polly  ( who is sometimes on sometimes off in her relationship with one of her professors )  while remembering about a local girl back home named cindy who he kind of left in the lurch after they finally went all the way .just before danny is ready to go home for spring break and work on his father's mobile lunchmobile ,  cindy arrives at the school with a big surprise .   this changes danny's view on things and makes him numb to the point that he even doesn't care when some toughs try to hone in on his father's lunch route and threaten him .danny goes back to school after the break and after resolving his issues with cindy to attend the big bash that his friend matt was planning at the beginning of the book .this book like one of his later works ,  little children ,  shows perrota's talent for creating intriguing characters in such short novels .   this book like the other seems to end too prematurely and definately screams out for a sequel !perrota is a super talented writer and i would love to seem him develop a much larger complete novel than leave the audience hanging at the end of another short one
i have bought many books in my life ,  but randy gage's  " why you're dumb ,  sick and broke "  is the first time i ever bought a book with a parental advisory warning for explicit language .  gage does things a little differently than anyone else ,  which is something i quickly discovered when reading this book .  this book is brash ,  to the point and filled with insight and inspiration .  i thought that gage presented his points in a well thought out manner that really took the establishment on head on .many points presented in the book are in other personal development books .  however ,  i don't know of any book that has all these points in one book .  even gage himself admits in an interview that this is a combination of think and grow rich ,  the secret ,  ayn rand and several other books and cd's .a lot of it you have heard before ,  like if you say you are broke ,  then you will always be broke .  however ,  i didn't realize how much the mainstream media and the political establishment are contributing to our negative ,  broke thoughts .  most frightening of all ,  i learned why the establishment needs us to be broke in order to keep their power .  i am taking randy's lead and watching less tv ,  especially the news .  that's the worst of all !there is also a nice introduction to libertarianism and the works of ayn rand .  as a libertarian myself ,  i was delighted to see this included in the book .  with recent reports circulating about britain on the verge of becoming a police state ,  this warning about big government couldn't have come at a more appropriate time .as expected ,  randy does make a plug for mlm ,  but this is by no means an mlm book .  the mlm plug is just a few short pages .  however ,  it is still a nice resource for mlm people to use for third party credibility .  he also mentioned real estate and information marketing as good businesses as well .  i must be smart ,  healthy and rich ,  as i am already involved in all three .i found myself nodding in agreement to this book .  i also found a lot of places where i was thinking ,   " oh ,  i'm not the only one who this this way .  why hasn't this been mentioned before in the press ?  "  other times ,  i thought ,   " oh my god ,  i am being really manipulated here .  "  while he was  " preaching to the choir "  with me ,  i'm sure that many people with more  " mainstream "  views will feel more challenged reading this book .bottom line ,  if you love mlm get 10 copies of this book ,  if you support the libertarians ,  get 10 copies of this book .  if you are like me and love them both ,  get 25 copies .about the authorcarlos scarpero is the host of the network marketing minute podcast and the creator of the success duplicator downline building system .

as i read ,  i kept trying to figure out whether this tale is a collection of reflections on how two religions can destroy a region and its people ,  whether the characters have broader agendas than their stories or whether it's just a good tale peppered with strong political images .and ,  a good story it is .   how can you beat this writing ?" the pandits of kashmir were left to rot in their slum camps ,  to rot while the army and the insurgency fought over the bloodied and broken valley ,  to dream of return ,  to die while dreaming of return ,  to die after the dream of reture died so that they could not even die dreaming of it ,  why was that why as that why was that why was that why was that "   ( p .  297 )" the beauty approached him ,  beckoning .   her arm slipped around his shoulder ,  supple as a snake ,  and like a snake her leg coiled around his .   then like a third snake her other arm and like a fourth snake her other leg until she was slithering all over him .  .  .  .   she had as many arms and legs as a goddess ,  and multilimbed and irrestible she coiled and tightened around him and ,  finally ,  with all the power she possessed ,  she bit .   the accidental death by king cobra snakebit of  [ the ]  general was announced  .  .  .  the next morning and he was buried with full honors .  .  .  .

engrossing and amusing travelogue by world's crankiest traveler .some people really hate theroux ,  accusing him of snobbery ,  self importance ,  and bigotry .   i can certainly see why some readers wouldn't be able to deal with his style and opinions ,  but i must say that this volume might be a pretty good litmus test of readers' tolerance for the author's travel works .    ( if you can enjoy this one ,  you'll probably enjoy his other non-fiction works )  .i ,  for one ,  totally enjoyed hearing about grunge-y has-been towns ,  obnoxious holiday camps ,  and seedy hotels .   to me ,  the book was a real page-turner ,  and he writes so vividly of scenery .   i felt he wrote about the worst bits of his trip with true humor ,  reminding us travelers that it's helpful to keep a sense of humor during the rough times .i felt the book was a pretty decent scouting report for the island's shoreline ,  and i now know what to avoid there .   i can definitely thank theroux and his fussy standards !if you like theroux ,  it's a good bet you'll love this one .

videohound's cult flicks and trash pics is a book that i consult often .  not only is it informative ,  but it's very entertaining reading as well .  this is a book that any cult movie lover should own .  if the names roger corman ,  lloyd kaufman ,  ray dennis steckler ,  david lynch ,  frank henenlotter ,  jack hill ,  herschel gordon lewis ,  dario argento ,  paul bartel ,  russ meyer ,  terry gilliam ,  alex cox ,  edward d .  wood ,  ken russell ,  george romero and john waters mean anything to you then you need this book .  in addition to reviews of hundreds and hundreds of cult films ,  the book has lengthy bios of many of the above filmmakers as well as actors and other important cult figures .  plus there are tons of photos ,  there's a big specific category index to help you find exactly what you're looking for and indexes for actors ,  directors and writers .  one of my favorite features is that nearly every page features a quote from one of the movies featured in the book .  this is a great book though it's far from complete .  lots of movie geeks will be able to look through the book and point out any number of movies that were left out .  however ,  for every movie you know of that's not in the book there are probably five that you've never heard of .  i recommend cult flicks and trash pics very highly
it's been awhile since i had a really good crime mystery read .   therefore ,  i was excited when the cold moon by jeffery deaver arrived at the library .   the latest lincoln rhyme novel delivered just what i was looking for .  .  .   twists ,  turns ,  and plenty of forensic work .the plotline here starts out on two tracks .   a killer nicknamed the watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques .   his signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene .  rhyme and amelia sachs ,  his partner ,  are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die .   sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder .   the murder points to a run-down bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis .   there's a strong chance that the cops are corrupt ,  so sachs has to step carefully as it's not clear who she can trust .   the two cases converge when the watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that sachs is investigating .   but the layering of deception goes even deeper than that ,  and rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind the watchmaker .  .  .if you want plot twists and turns ,  this book will definitely satisfy .   there are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion ,  only to be something else entirely .   the layering of plots by the killer never seems to end ,  and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction .   a couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top ,  but not so much as to put me off the story .   it's a book i really didn't want to put down ,  even though i had other things i should be doing .  .
this is a great book about risk .   very valuable .   written in a clear and easy to understand style .a bargain at 5 times the price .   you can't get this info and data anywhere else

( i would like to say , retarded )  .one day paul gets into an accident and gets both of his legs severely damaged . coincidently , guess who finds him ?annie . yes , she finds him and starts to nurse him back to good health . but when she soon finds out that paul has killed the character  " misery "  , annie is pissed .  .  . she makes it her business to get paul to write another novel in which  " misery "  is not killed . it sounds simple , i know . but when paul refuses to write the novel , annie uses force , and she tortures him so much that he just gives in and begins to write a new novel .meanwhile thinking of a way to escape , paul writes the novel and suffers at the same time . he lost one of his foot , because she burnt it off ! yes , this annie wilkes is a lunatic . while paul is under annie's capture , he learns alot about things he took for granted . the ending of this book is a happy one , you won't be disappointed . i recommend this book as any other sk novel . it is a great suspense , drama novel .  .  . enjoy .  .  . nigelhere is another version of the plot .  ( taken from wikipedia )  .  .  ." the story begins with paul sheldon slowly waking out of a coma .  gradually ,  his memory returns to him :  he is a wildly popular romance novelist of the misery series of novels  ( the main character of which is named misery chastain )  who has crashed his car in a winter storm outside of silver creek in grand county ,  colorado ,  and has been badly injured .  his rescuer ,  annie wilkes ,  is a former registered nurse and has taken him to her secluded country home to personally care for him .as luck would have it ,  annie is paul's  " number one fan "  and eagerly awaited all his publications .  almost immediately however ,  paul realizes that there is a flip side to this coin :  annie is mentally ill ,  she has not told anyone where he is ,  and she has a violent past that includes a successful career as a serial killer .annie begins to physically and psychologically abuse paul when she finishes reading his latest published work ,  in which the heroine misery dies .  annie later forces him to burn an unpublished manuscript of his new novel ,   " fast cars "  he was carrying at the time of his accident ,  disgusted at its radical departure from the misery series .  eventually ,  annie forces paul to write a new misery novel  " just for her "  and bring the character back from the dead .  paul works on the book as annie's violent mood swings and her psychosis deepens .  her insanity escalates as paul tries to escape ;  she eventually chops off one of paul's feet ,  one of his thumbs ,  and murders a police officer investigating his disappearance .  as the authorities begin to close in on annie ,  paul's plight--both in his writing and his attempt to save his life--becomes more desperate .paul eventually defeats annie by smashing her over the head with the second hand typewriter she had given him to write  " her "  novel .  after he escapes ,  he publishes the new misery novel to great critical acclaim .

i love this series .   i have every one of the books in this series and will never let them go .
this book is about yoga for the heart ,  which is rare in our body sculpting culture ,  yet paradoxically heart diseases are one of the greatest risk factors for our modern health .  a simple ,  profound gift of yoga is the  recognition that the body is the temple for the indwelling spirit .   realizing this simple truth profoundly affects our relationship to the  body .  through the author's lifetime committment to the teachings of yoga ,   we glimpse the relevance of the yogic lifestyle .  this book serves as a  guide in making healthier choices in everyday life .  by walking for awhile  with nischala ,  we touch a deeper realization of the unity that yoga brings .   i recommend this book to any yoga practitioner ,  teacher ,  as well as anyone  who seeks greater peace of mind and physical well-being
wow !  !  !   this is a ton of great information from a 'been there ,  done that' mom and grandma .the author shares wisdom ,  humor and stories all wrapped in grace .  .  .( i loved that i could read it and be inspired to be better ,  encouraged for the great things i am doing ,  but not feel guilty about all the stuff i'm not doing .  )this is a celebration  of the family .  i think i might make it my new standard baby shower gift !  !
i adored this book .   the character development is strong ,  and delightful !  with the exception of the villain ,  all characters are likeable .   i couldn't wait to read the next book in the trilogy
a late divorce is one of my very favorites novels .   this ordinary tale about the late divorce of a middle-aged couple ,  one of whom is in a mental institution ,  is told from the perspective of each member of the family :   children ,  their spouses and mates ,  grandson , etc .   i have rarely laughed so  much ,  or been touched so much ,  by the insightful description of the kaminka  family and their travails over a failed marriage ,  real estate and conflict .    the scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity  at its best .  .  . a wonderful work ,  original ,  illuminating and funny
while on maternity leave from cambridge university and with her husband away handling a legal matter in los angeles ,  professor cassandra james meets her neighbor actress melissa meadows and her spouse keith kingleigh .   melissa and cassandra share an affinity since both recently gave birth prematurely .   kevin is going to direct a production starring melissa .   he asks cassandra to adapt the victorian drama east lynn ,  which she agrees to do .as opening night beckons ,  cassandra notices the cast seems extra nervous .   later an anxious melissa calls cassandra believing that someone is stalking her .   cassandra tries to calm her down .   the next day melissa fails to appear for a rehearsal so cassandra goes to visit her .   melissa is gone without a word ,  but abandoned her six month old baby that she had shown so much love .   with her own fussy infant at her side ,  cassandra wonders what happened to her new friend while unable to contact stephen ,  dealing with the abrupt arrival of her first husband ,  and detective sergeant vickers suspecting the professor killed the actress .stage fright ,  the second professor james tale  ( see murder is academic )  ,  is a fabulous amateur sleuth mystery that builds up the suspense slowly so that the reader like the heroine suspects everyone's motives .   either foul play occurred or melissa had played the role of a loving mother ,  but cassandra cannot find a motive for either scenario while the evidence points towards her so that even the audience will believe she harmed or murdered the actress .   this is a fantastic english mystery in the christie tradition .harriet klausner
first ,  the strengths :  andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists ,  with chapters on munsterberg ,  arnheim ,  eisenstein ,  balazs ,  kracauer ,  bazin ,  mitry ,  metz ,  and ayfre ,  and agel .  he focuses on the debate between the formalists  ( who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing ,  framing ,  mise-en-scene ,  lighting ,  and etc .  )  and the realist tradition  ( who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography ,  a physical impression of its subject )  .  the highlight is undoubtedly andrew's excellent discussion of the great french critic andre bazin ,  which is not surprising since andrew's ph . d thesis was on bazin .  the weaknesses :  this was published in 1976 ,  and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then ,  especially feminism ,  and the influence of lacan and psychoanalytic theory .  still ,  this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory
angus konstam's history of pirates  uses works from the mariners' museum in virginia to provide a powerful visual impact .  piracy from ancient to modern times is surveyed in a series of maps ,  images ,  and discussions that cover specific events ,  regions ,  and pirates .  plenty of historical and political background to the events place each in perspective and provide an excellent survey of mariner events of the times .  there are other pirate histories on the market - but none with the commitment to visuals of history of pirates .
i got my copy of &quot ; the five keys to value investing&quot ;  as a graduation gift from my dad who is a longtime professional equities investor .   he thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before i start my career on wall street .   i was not disappointed .   the five keys is a very good summary of what i learned in business school and much ,  much more .   the author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like buffett and graham .   the experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile ;  but what makes this book very special is the framework .   i have read several investment books over the years ,  but none like this one .   putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw .   in addition ,  reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work .   the clarity in the concepts and the  " conversation-like "  tone was particularly attractive to me .  in sum ,  this is a very coherent ,  practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective -- considering the authors' strong unapologetic bias towards value investing
citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man ,  thorby ,  as he matures from boy to man .  starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar ,  baslim ,  we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom ,  though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men' .  the society he paints here is vivid and believable  ( though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me )  .  baslim is far more than he appears to be ,  and puts thorby through a rigorous education ,  both academic and practical .  how do you become a really good beggar ?  here heinlein falls in with ayn rand - whatever you do ,  do it to the best of your ability ,  from begging to juggling .  also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums .  these are items that may pass over young readers' heads ,  but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined ,  nothing should be accepted on 'faith' ,  that personal integrity is more important than 'success' ,  that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action .later ,  baslim calls in some favors and sends thorby to live with the free traders ,  a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture .  here thorby discovers another aspect of freedom :  a person's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives .  the free trader society  ( which owes much to margaret mead's seminal ideas ,  and highlighted by an anthropologist character named margaret mader - heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names )  of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security ,  peace of mind ,  and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads ,  but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice .  this section of the book may be the best part ,  as the society is so different from today's american culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right ,  apart from its effects on thorby .  thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book ,  from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires .the last section deals with thorby back on earth ,  within a society not much different from our own ,  and shows a third aspect of freedom :  the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them .  freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces .  as this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society  ( though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic/lawyer dominated one )  ,  it isn't as engrossing as the first two sections ,  but is highly important in terms of completing heinlein's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom .characterization other than thorby and baslim is pretty thin ,  especially for the females that appear in supporting roles .  this was fairly typical for his juveniles ,  as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character .  but the thematic line on slavery/freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books ,  and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works  ( most especially farnham's freehold )  ,  has to be seen as one of heinlein's personal beliefs  ( unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate )  .this book is not heinlein's absolute best ,  nor even the best of his so-called 'juveniles'  ( which are typically better reading than most 'adult' mainstream bestsellers )  ,  but still provides an engrossing ,  fun ,  and illuminating read .  recommended for all readers willing to look at life styles different from their own .--- reviewed by patrick shepherd  ( hyperpat )
i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona .   my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine !   but more surprisingly ,  i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many  " characters "  .   the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience ,  especially in nyc's  " best "  restaurants .   her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective  ( as objective as food tastes get ,  i suppose )  review .   a very easy and enjoyable read .
i borrowed this book on cd from the library and half way through ,  ordered the book so i would have it to refer to .  excellent book ,  highly recommended .  helps to put a realistic perspective on millionaires
dark nature cuts to the very core of the will to survive .   mr .  watson takes you on an easy to read journey  " up "  the food chain to the homo sapiens :  who is neither man nor kind .   for me ,  dark nature removed judgment from the word  " evil "  ,  giving a deeper ,  behind the scene look at what drives life .   a must read .   this copy was purchased a gift .  in my judgment to continue to grow i needed to understand this piece of myself and the world around me
i've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title ,  and i must strongly disagree .   malphurs' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches i have found to date .   in place of the term  " advanced "  in the title ,  a better word would be  " comprehensive .  "   nonetheless ,  malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight .as a pastor of twenty years ,  i wish this book had been available when i first started in ministry .   i hope this title is now offered in many seminaries ,  because its content would be a gold mine for young ,  soon-to-be church leaders .   pastors ,  church staff members ,  and lay leaders ,  this volume is a must-have .   in my opinion ,  it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership
definitely one of the best books i have read .  the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by mark haddon is a complex mixture of simple things .  the simplicity of the language ,  style ,  ideas ,  characters and concepts is unique to this book .  the expression of complicated life matters and situations in such a simple manner makes this book a definite must-have .in the book ,  mark haddon borrows the voice of his lead character christopher ,  an autistic child ,  to tell the story .  christopher is an autistic and smart 15 year old boy .  he's a math whiz with an unsatisfiable appetite to solve problems .  his approach to all life issues is to convert them into a math problem of some sort and find out ways to deal with these issues .the story mainly revolves around christopher's investigation to find out who killed his neighbour's dog wellington .  despite his father's instructions to not pursue the issue ,  christopher goes on to attempt to solve the mystery of who killed wellington .the story unravels before christopher and he is hit with a reality far more complex than his own understanding of life .  his investigations result in only unearthing long buried secrets of his mother who ,  he knows ,  died three years earlier .christopher's determination to solve the mystery of who killed wellington and the mystery of his mother's death is something to be revered throughout the development of the story .  the child's emotional roller coaster ride is witnessed first hand on every page .  the reader experiences christopher's feelings and emotions so transparently that it makes it extremely difficult not to feel attached to the story .the story in itself is funny at times ,  sad and miserable at others ;  complex in one place and extremely simple in another .this is a novel that you can be certain will change the way you perceive the things in your life once you are through .  your world will never be the same again .  in a good way
" an american tragedy "  by theodore dreiser is considered one of the greatest american books ever written .   this may be the case if you can get past the first chapter .   five times ,  i have tried to read this book .   to date ,  i am 0 for 5 ,  having fallen asleep each time trying to read it .   if you're a bit of a lazy reader or one who doesn't want to work through a book ,  this is not for you .   try mark twain instead
ms .  roddick has managed to put together some important issues ,  outstanding commentators ,  and good information design in one place with this book .   i read it through from cover-to-cover  ( i seldom do this )  and found myself both enlightened and inspired .  i recommend it highly
the original publication of _the lives of john lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria .   much of it emanated from yoko ono ,  who likened goldman's book to  " being punched in the face .  "   yoko is a close friend of jann wenner of rolling stone magazine ,  which duly ran an article attempting to discredit goldman's book .   some of lennon's fans took this behavior in and assumed that _the lives of john lennon_ was forbidden ;  they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty .now ,  however ,  the dust has settled ,  and _the lives of john lennon_ holds up beautifully .   each contention of goldman's which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands .   remember the ridiculous panic over goldman's portrait of lennon as a heavy drug user ?   that drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew lennon ,  including ono and lennon's first wife ,  cynthia powell .   the same is true about goldman's claims about lennon's tendency towards violence  ( a tendency lennon himself owned up to in his playboy interview )  .   and ,  while ono and others acted agitated over goldman's depiction of lennon as bisexual ,  ono herself is found to have said she considered john lennon a  " closet fag "  in a 1981 interview .    ( why ,  then ,  was ono so upset by the appearance of goldman's book ?   because of what it reveals about her .  )it will be clear to anyone who approaches goldman's book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified .   _the lives of john lennon_ is not dishonest or flawed in any way .   a perusal at his  " sources "  section reveals his awesome thoroghness .   goldman bravely explored areas of lennon's and ono's lives that others shied away from out of deference to ono ,  a worshipful attitude towards lennon ,  and a reluctance to figure things out .   albert goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject .   _the lives of john lennon_ might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify lennon ,  but for those with genuine interest in lennon ,  it is indispensable .
this book tells us the truth that has been hidden from most u . s .  citizens for so many years .  each chapter tells about a different regime change given us all the dirty little details ,  names and places of the participants .   this book helped me and will help all of us to finally understand  " why they hate us "  .  i only regret that their is not a sequel
you want to read a horror story ?  this is it .  this is the shameful way our government dealt with aids in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all .everyone ignored it .  the cdc ,  the nih ,  the national cancer institute ,  it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors ,  and they were ignored too .  over 2000 gay men  ( and hemophiliacs ,  and straight people ,  and babies )  died before the government even acknowleged that yes ,  something new was going around .  newspapers and media did not report this ,  because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a  " gay disease .  "  gay men didn't want to discuss that it  " might "  be spread through sex ,  and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable .  blood banks wouldn't even acknowlege the fact that their products were contaminated ,  even after it was proven that transfusion aids was possible and happening .by the time president reagan first uttered the word aids ,  over 25 , 000 americans were dead from the disease .this book made me cry .  the entire way through it ,  i wanted to scream ,  i wanted to throw things ,  i wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too .  a university official that was denying aids researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark ,   " well ,  at least aids is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people .  "  how absolutely disgusting .this is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading ,  all of it frustrating ,  angering ,  scream-inducing ,  and yet ,  still inspiring .  they didn't give up .  no one threw in the towel until their last breath ,  or until funding ,  sufficient funding ,  was finally granted .  sadly ,  the author himself died of aids in 1994 .  god bless everyone who worked so hard to make aids a household word ,  which finally happened ,  oh ,  about seven stinking years after it first started killing people in the us .  what the heck is wrong with this country ?  why did people have their heads in the sand for so long ?  what's so stinking wrong with us ?another book everyone should read ,  if only to know how our government helped spread aids around the world by ignoring it for six damn years .  how many people did they kill by doing that ?  far ,  far too many .  we were the last civilized nation to institute an aids education/prevention program .  this book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more ,  and i didn't think that was possible .god bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with aids
i really enjoyed this book .  it was interesting and fast .  it kept my attention and i did not want to put the book down .
this is a retitled re-issue of _invisible republic_ .  for its content ,  then ,  it clearly deserves a 5-star rating  ( at least from here )  .  however ,  you ought to know what you will be getting if you already have that classic
i bought this reluctantly because it was decided upon by a discussion group i was partipating in ,  but i ended up being very glad to have read this wonderful piece of contemporary literature .  mary lawson weaves an incredibly sad but totally compelling tale of life in a small community in canada .  others here have given insight into the plot and characters ,  so i'll keep this short by saying that you won't be disappointed and that i eagerly look forward to reading more from this author ,  she seems to have exceptional talent
this book brought tears to my eyes the first time i read it .   it is warm and comforting .   a wonderful message for children that their mama will always be there no matter what .  .

my almost-6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi-pronged approach ,  including things like supplements ,  a gfcf diet ,  and ot/pt/speech .  after a year on the gfcf diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors ,  we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies .our close friends' daughter ,  now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism ,  took a similar approach ,  but even more strict ,  following the dan protocol as well as the recommendations of this book ,  including chelation ,  a dizzying array of supplements ,  gfcf diet ,  ot/pt/speech ,  aba ,  etc .while our child has made tremenous advances ,  or friends' child has not ,  beyond minor advances related to her age--at 4 ,  she is still non-verbal ,  far from potty trained ,  exhibits many repetitive behaviors ,  and needs constant verbal and visual cues for the simplest tasks .the point i am trying to make is that every child is different and no one ,  no one has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a significant percentage of children with autism .  autism ,  as most of you likely know well ,  is a catch-all term .  our friends' daughter no doubt has a very different kind of pathology than ours .  i have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action ,  rather than immediately launching into predictions of one  " cure "  for a broad range of issues .while i do think some of what the author recommends can be helpful  ( and it really may offer a tremendous help for some children with autism )  ,  some of the therapies  ( like chelation )  can be very dangerous--in fact ,  i have yet to see one of the many families who tried chelation therapy see *any* improvement in their child's symptoms .  i have seen more success with gfcf diets  ( for a small percentage of children )  ,  but the greatest success seems to come with comprehensive behavioral therapy .i certainly understand where families are coming from--i have been there myself ,  but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to  " cure "  them with multiple substances that have had very little study/peer review in a desperate frenzy of worry is both dangerous to their bodies and destructive to their emotions .  as with anything ,  balance is your approach will serve you and your child well .
i have long been aware of the commercial success of author nora roberts but the storylines and writing style  ( a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance )  have never tempted me to read any of her work .  however ,  i happened to pick up a copy of volume #21  ( depending on how you count anthology inclusions )  in the  .  .  .  .  in death series written under the pen name j . d .  robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series  ( the year is 2058 )  with a strong central character  ( detective lieutenant eve dallas )  who had a continuing romantic interest  ( the mysterious irish billionaire roarke )  .  i have long enjoyed the spenser series by robert parker and the ensemble cast of ed mcbain's 87th precinct novels ;  the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of new york city ,  an area very familiar to me .  i was immediately hooked by survivor in death and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review  ( 3/30/2005 )  .  i read origin in death ,  the next book in the series ,  as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well  ( 7/26/2005 )  .  as with other series which i have enjoyed ,  i then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved .in my opinion ,  the early stories in the series can best be labeled transition novels as romance author roberts attempts to transform herself into mystery writer robb .  my recent three star review  ( 11/29/2005 )  of naked in death ,  the initial book in the series ,  discusses the specific positives and negatives of that attempt ,  so i will not go into detail again here .  and in summary ,  i found this book a much better police procedural although with the major flaw that it seemed a little too obvious that eve's pursuit of her initial suspect  ( although logical )  would turn out to be a diversion from her identification of the real killer .  i so greatly enjoyed susan ericksen's audio rendition  ( unabridged cd )  of that book that i also chose to listen to the audio version of this novel ;  i highly recommend her narration as likely to add to your enjoyment of the story .a wonderfully apt dryden quotation concerning fame and death opens this story ;  then lt .  eve dallas is discovered at the scene of a shocking homicide .  prosecuting attorney cicely towers ,  a powerful and widely recognized star in the district attorney's office and a woman with whom eve has dealt on occasion ,  has been found with her throat brutally slashed in a nasty neighborhood far from her office and her home late one night .  the final appointment in her datebook is for an earlier dinner with her good friend and long time lover george hammett ;  eve quickly establishes that she arrived safely home and subsequently received a mystery call of which she made no record but which obviously drew her to the scene of her death .  eve's investigation is complicated by the close friendship of cicely's ex-husband marco angelini and their adult children  ( david and marina )  with her boss ,  commander whitney and his increasing concern as eve's investigation concentrates on the family .  eve discovers that both david angelini and marina's fiance randall slade have financial problems which could provide a motive for murder ;  as additional damaging background information surfaces she appears to be on a collision course with whitney's understandable concern both for these children who have suffered the tragic loss of their mother ;  in addition ,  the stress increases when it appears that the friendship whitney's wife with the family may lead to her potential involvement as a material witness .  finally ,  a further complication which brings into question dallas' objectivity is the revelation that the angelini family ,  cicely towers and eve's lover roarke are are partners in a business venture .additional murders soon occur which bear the signature trademark of the killer ,  and media pressure intensifies on eve given the visible lack of progress in her investigation and the antipathy which she has evoked in c . j .  morse ,  who coanchors the evening news with her friend nadine furst .  eve is infuriated by c . j . 's actions and yet knows that in fact the only effective way to silence the slimeball's continual attempts to denigrate her investigatory skills during his broadcasts is identify and catch the murderer .  meanwhile ,  eve is also involved in establishing the boundaries in her relationship with roarke ,  both with regard to their personal lives and when his aid might be appropriate in her police investigation .  after several twists ,  including one diversion which i had not anticipated ,  the story suddenly rockets towards a violent climax which it is not clear that all the central characters will survive .in addition to roarke ,  commander whitney ,  lt .  dallas ,  and reporter nadine furst ,  this story contains all the series characters introduced in the first volume including dr .  mira and the unique irrepressible mavis freestone and summerset ,  all of whom play relatively minor roles in this narrative .  finally ,  the reader is introduced to patrol ( wo ) man peabody ,  whose observational skills in her relatively minor role in this case commend her to eve .  she will eventually become both eve's good friend and partner on subsequent cases and their complementary styles and skills will combine with their dedication to speaking for the dead and their loved ones will serve them well .if you plan to read several volumes of the series ,  i strongly suggest that you start with naked in death and then read this book even though they are inferior to the two later books which i have read .  the later books include details concerning the mysteries of roarke's and dallas' childhood backgrounds and the impact on their individual lives which provide a context that i would have preferred to have gradually unfold as i completed the series in the sequence which the author intended .  and certainly ,  if you want a romance/detective story then read nasked in death .  while this book still had some steamy sequences much more typical of nora robert's novels than the later stories in this sequence ,  they were much more infrequent and better integrated into the story .  however ,  if you only plan to sample a few stories in the series ,  then i strongly suggest that you skip the early books and concentrate on some of the later novels ,  including either of the two which i mention at the beginning of this review .  the characters and their relationships are much more developed as the series progresses and the plots are also more complex .  meanwhile ,  i plan to continue to pursue the dual goal of reading each of the new releases as they occur while gradually filling in my knowledge of dallas' past cases .tucker anderse
with the release of jasper fforde's fourth title in the thursday next sci-fi/fantasy series ,  readers will be treated to the culmination of the alternative earth that the author has spent three books building .  in  " something rotten ,  "  the options for direction for the series are fully realized as the alternate earth of 1988 and the world of fiction are completely in place .when last we left the intrepid thursday next ,  she had just saved the world of fiction from yet another villain intent on its destruction .  pregnant and with her husband erased from history by the evil goliath corporation ,  thursday's finally given birth to a son ,  friday ,  who at two year old only speaks in lorem ipsum  ( a good example of the craziness of fforde's vision .  )  deciding that her time overseeing the purity of novels has worn thin ,  she returns to earth and winds up becoming :* the target of an assassin* the coach of her town's professional croquet team* the thorn in the side of a hypnotic politician who is actually fictional* the hostess to hamlet ,  prince of denmark* the on-again ,  off-again wife to her exterminated ,  unexterminated husband* the finder of a live clone of william shakespeare* the friend of neanderthals everywhere* dead--twice* the holder of the secrets of the apocalypse* the once-again savior of the planetif you think that's about three books in one ,  well that pegs  " something rotten .  "  fforde packs this book so full of plot and sub-plot that readers must juggle all those narrative balls at once .  that fforde can bring all this together at the end shows that his mastery of his world has grown since the start of this series ,   " the eyre affair .  "while not as inventive as his previous book ,   " the well of lost plots ,  "  fforde's world-building is largely done ,  so  " something rotten "  can focus on the story and not on backstory--that's a big plus .  longtime readers of the series will find that this fourth book finally illuminates some of the backstory that existed even in the first book .  for instance ,  we finally get to see who millon de floss is and get a better look at the genetic experiments that have resulted in an england overrun with mammoths ,  dodos ,  and neanderthals .all the typical humor that we've come to expect from fforde is here and he's done well picking up the mantle of douglas adams .  someone has to write nutty british sci-fi and fforde is doing it about as well as anyone right now .  and while  " something rotten "  is a terrible place for new readers to jump into the thursday next books ,  for fans of the series this is probably the most satisfying of his books .enjoy

suzanne brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in .   the  " mystery "  portion of the story and the romance between jane and cosmo left a little to be desired .   i really didn't understand why jane had to have her alternative personality as mercedes and cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened seal persona .   these particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to jules and robin ,  who clearly stole the show in this book .as a matter of fact ,  of the different plots and stories going on in this book ,  jules' was the best .   it was not only very well-written and sweet ,  but even as a hetrosexual female ,  i could identify with jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him ,  happens to all of us ,  whether you are in a gay or straight relationship .   i am really hoping that jules either gets his own book ,  or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness .  i do share ms .  brockmann's opinion when it comes to differences in appearance ,  nationality ,  sexual orientation ,  etc .  and i really like how she includes this in her books .   as far as i'm concerned love is love ,  no matter what and it's portrayed beautifully here .please ms .  brockmann ,  don't allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline ,  it's a very good one
it's been around two years since i first read this book ,  and i must say i reference it to people all the time .   the reason :  it is so darn fascinating .   i really liked how the author put things in context and made me think about media forms and how we transfer data .   if i gave you an 8-track tape right now ,  would you know what to do with it to get the info contained on it ?   younger folks might not know what it is .   they would recognize tape  ( maybe )  ,  but 100 years from now ,  how many players would be around ?   the book talks about a project the author was on .   a nuclear waste site in new mexico needed to have a way to communicate to humans  ( or others )  in the future that the site is radioactive .   since the radiation could last 10 , 000 years ,  the message would have to be able to be understood centuries from now .   what would the message be like ?   if you read the book you'll find out !   lots of different ideas are kicked around and i just couldn't put the book down .   buy it ,  have fun
i took the 2 tom cover's classes in information theory at stanford last year .  we used this book as the text for both classes .  the first class covered roughly the first 8 chapters and the second class the remaining ones .  this book assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of basic probability theory .tom's classes were among the most enjoyable i took last year and i recommend this text to anyone interested in knowing about information theory .  if you just want to know the basics ,  read through chapters 1-8 .  the reader interested in understanding the power of information theory is adviced to read the whole book .  a final comment ,  it is clear to me after my experience with tom's classes that mastering information theory is a daunting task .  and in fact ,  this book provides the interested researcher just with the basic knowledge needed to enter the field
how this book flew under the nation's radar---i'll ever know .   furthermore it's discouraging as hell because it only goes to prove that great work so often goes unrecognized .this book plays out like a spielberg movie from page one .   very spielbergian because of it's perfect blend of adventure ,  romance and humor .   the characters are dynamic and interesting as hell .the storyline is straight out of an indiana jones serial ,  and it keeps building until you're reading as fast as you possibly can just to see what happens .the art work is astounding .   these are the coolest-looking heroes ,  sexiest women ,  and the most powerful looking baddies i've ever seen penciled in my life .it's just a shame that this book isn't getting the buzz that crap like  " ultimate spider-man "  is getting---because in all reality this is the best graphic novel on the shelves right now---and could easily be the film adaptation that could return steven spielberg to greatness .for once in a very long time .  .  . i'm truly blown away .

dry is anything but what the title of this work implies . the pages drip with boozy escapades and one can almost smell and taste the liquor on augusten burroughs breath . a must for drinkers who would like to stop or at least reassess what the heck is going on in their lives . almost motivational in its honest appraisal of the difficulties inherent in this addiction .  the writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth , funny ,  yet foreboding and diary-like in its presentation . burroughs clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it ,  especially the limited usefulness of rehab . the story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call ,   " a hard core drinker "  as he anticipates the  " next one "  . passages describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas , job and sexual conundrums . dry is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit them . this is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle ,  yet has a strong finish . an earlier work 'running with scissors' was apparently good enough for hollywood ,  so take a shot with dry . after all ,  when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do ,  it might be time to slow down , stop and get a copy of twelve steps and twelve traditions ,  and a copy of dry .   cheers !  !
exposure to harv eker's millionaire mind intensive set me on a path of working towards financial freedom over two years ago .   i also attended the guerilla business school ,  a $2500 intensive .what is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually  ( as it did with me )  shift your perspective ,  if you are at all open to having it shifted .getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones .this book may help you ,  but the seminar will help you more .the millionaire mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me .    i am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called zerodollarmarketer dot com .being rich is a matter of perspective .   true wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind ,  my relationships ,  and lastly my pocketbook .   but its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month .a journey worth pursuing
'conservatives without conscience' does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science .   there is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science ,  but john dean does a good job of explaining the basics ,  and how it applies to our modern political landscape .this is not new information ,  it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the carl rove wing of the republican party .   the academics keep measuring and refining their understanding ,  and carl rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public .   finally ,  someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see .   knowledge is power ,  so everyone should read his book .   however ,  one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character ,  so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits .   they don't tend to read books much anyway .   it is a book  for the open minded ,  that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape ,   the by any means necessary tactics of many named players ,  and the proto-fascist movement that has hijacked our country .john dean pulls no punches .   he names names and kicks butt .   he gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism ,  but even that is well worth the effort .if you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the republican party and those who  unquestionably support them ,  then read this book .   it is an eye opener
walter boyne's the influence of air power upon history is an informed and informative history which examines the nature and applications of air power from the early days of the balloon to current space warfare and jets .  air power exercised in both war and peace times survey the contributions made by people and technology of each era ,  drawing some important links between individual achievement and usage
this book is comprehensive and easy to follow .   every recipe i have tried has worked .   the pecan pie recipe is especially good ,  and very easy for novice bakers .   if you could have only one dessert book on your shelf ,  this would be it
this is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution ,  how it will wither away ,  and what a society should look like  (  or try to mould itself into  )  after the revolution .   lenin ,  drawing on the works of marx  and engels extensively ,  refutes many claims by both the anarchists and  opportunists on the role of the state ,  and corrects many common errors  believed about the marxist road to socialism .   this is a thoroughly  informative read .   i recommend those wondering how a communist society  would emerge after a revolution to get this book ;   it will open your eyes  widely
this book is the most eye-opening ,  amazing ,  enlightening and practical work i have ever read .  there were so many jewels of wisdom and edifying anecdotes in these pages .  anyone who is serious about improving their relations with others on the job and socially should read this work with the utmost attention .  if everyone practiced these simple principles ,  this society would be truly utopian .  that is why i bought 12 of them :  to be able to give it to friends and associates who i believe would really benefit from it
flip the switch is an excellent book .   i'm 29 and tired of being overweight .   i bought this book months ago .   i read half of it ,  then moved from seattle to valdez ,  alaska .   all the while i was moving ,  i could not stop thinking about this book .   as soon as my shipment arrived ,  i found the book asap and finished it .i have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books .   i look at it this way :   spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10 . 00 for a resistance rope - plus - you get to do this in the privacy of your home .   this is a great idea ,  especially for women that have children ,  a job and the home to contend with .jim karas was overweight for several years .   he can relate to me .   he revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because i simply cannot handle cardio workouts due to a bad back .   the running and  " stepping "  in cardio is too much for me .this is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience
i sit here with my two newly acquired volumes of the oxford encyclopedia of food and drink in america in absolute awe !   with almost 200 contributors ,  almost 800 entries and nearly 400 illustrations ,  editor andy smith and oxford university press have done a magnificent job of putting together what is clearly the most comprehensive work on this immensely broad subject ever undertaken .   whether you are a food professional or interested amateur ,  a historian ,  sociologist or anthropologist ,  a student or scholar ,  these volumes will no doubt become your most important resource for information related in any way to the history of food and drink in america .   the scope is astounding ,  spanning some five centuries and ranging from events and trends to products ,  from ethnic ,  religions and cultural influences to political and social movements in american history ,  and also includes dozens of biographical entries of important contributors and influences on the development of culinary life and gastronomy in america .   despite the enormity of this work ,  it is refreshingly approachable ,  set forth alphabetically ,  written in clear language ,  translated when needed ,  and annotated and supplemented with bibliographical information for those wishing to explore further .   as a food professional-recipe developer ,  food writer and culinary educator-there is no doubt in my mind that these pages will soon be worn and this seminal work will remain among my most valued and cherished resources for as long as my interest in food and gastronomy is alive .
i had to read this book as an assignment for a seminary class on leadership .   i was sceptical that a children's book about witches would be applicable to a master's level college course .   my scepticism was unfounded .   this is a good ,  fun read .   but ,  more than that ,  this is a story that tugs at heart strings and teaches through the trials and personalities of it's characters .   i recommend it to  " children "  of all ages !
masterfully thought out & written .  not your usual supernatural ,  horror king story .  written in 4-5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural ,  but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood ,  follows them through the years & culminates with them as adults .  each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in .  at the end they are all tied together in some ways years later .  it's ingenious in it's finale and i advise you set aside some time for reading .  it's very difficult to put down .  once it grabs your interest ,  it just sucks you into the story .  if you remember your childhood friends  ( we all do )  you'll identify with the story
the use of an integrated development environment  [ ide ]  for a user to learn a language in ,  and to then program within ,  is well known .  microsoft has made powerful ides for its languages .  and the open source eclipse can be used for java .  along these lines ,  ducasse offers his book .  it teaches smalltalk using the squeak ide .the twist is that squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory ,  to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes .  as ducasse explains ,  squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger .  so a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital ,  given her limited background and possibly limited attention span .squeak uses smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language .  if you come from c++ ,  java or c# ,  you may be struck by its simplicity ,  compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages .  which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn smalltalk or squeak itself .i wonder a little about the book itself ,  though .  a motivated high school student could easily use it .  but for some younger students ?  in that situation ,  it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher ,  who can then instruct from it
many reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports .  i would agree as i have reporting experience with ms-access and crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly .   if you like learning in a step-by-step fashion right out of a book - this is the book !the bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book .   while this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book .   for example ,   one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book .   i would agree with that .  i was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book .if you want a better reference book try the wrox book ,  professional sql server 2005 reporting services .   that book is not as good as this book from a step-by-step standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions .   for example ,  page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows - they call it greenbar reports .   it was not easy to find in this book either .   how many people would look up  " greenbar reports "  in the reference ?   i was looking into  " shading alternative rows "  .   i just happened to stumble upon it .i bought both books together .   of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at reporting services .reporting services could use a cookbook-style text like they have for access and other programming languages .  those types of books have served me well over the years .  until then this book and the wrox book should do the trick
thank you laura jensen walker for your tender ,  touching and humorous insight into the value of our special girlfriends .   all women will love reading girl time
this book provides a straight-forward approach to a raw-food diet ,  and the changes required to maintain the health of your pet through the process .   it also helps to have someone who can assist you in locating the ingredients locally ,  but schultze provides all the requisite information that you will need .   a great resource to go to when you get a nagging question ,  or have a concern .   try not to let people talk you out of trying the diet ,  as you will see changes in the health of your pet ;  many veterinarians that i have spoken with are not particularly supportive .   my 2 y/o lab has a softer coat ,  clearer eyes ,  and better muscle tone since i have started him on the diet .   this diet is slightly more expensive than feeding dog chow ,  but the reward of having a healthy ,  happy pet far outweigh the associated costs .   good luck ,  and enjoy your pet
mark levine really ,  really ,  really knows his stuff .mark levine is really ,  really ,  good at explaining what he knows .note :  this book is not for beginners ,  but if you're ready to expand your jazz skills ,  there is no better book i've seen  ( except for his jazz piano book !  )
backgroundi read isaac's storm ,  by erik larson ,  around 1998 .  recently i had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review .  larson covered three killer hurricanes ,  two killer blizzards and one flash flood .galveston and related hurricanesmy first impression was that anyone who had read this book ,  about a major hurricane ,  would never consider riding out such a storm .  larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters .isaac cline was the u .  s .  weather service chief at galveston at this time .  this book gives much detail on the galveston storm .  this hit the island in september 1900 ,  with very little warning .  indeed it was the arrogance of the u .  s .  weather service in general ,  and issac cline ,  their station chief for this area ,  in particular ,  that essentially preempted any warning .   " cline was one of the 'new men' ,  a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms .  "  first ,  the u .  s .  weather service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from cuba .  the u .  s .  weather service had men stationed in cuba who  " said the storm was nothing to worry about .  "  cuban's  " own weather observers ,  who had pioneered hurricane detection ,  disagreed .  "  secondly the u .  s .  weather service insisted that ,  any storm warning had to come from the washington office ,  with absolutely no exceptions .  finally isaac had the conviction ,  and public position ,  that no hurricane could ever hit galveston ,  as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as galveston .  with such a position cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters .larson cited two older hurricanes in his book .* september 16 ,  1875 -  " the storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through indianola ,  pushing the waters of the gulf and matagorda bay inland until for 20 miles the back country prairie was an open sea .  "  this storm took 176 lives .* august 20 ,  1886 - this storm completed the destruction of indianola .  so many residents were killed that the survivors abandoned the town completely .in 1891 ,   " in the wake of a tropical storm that galveston weathered handily "  cline  was asked to appraise the city's vulnerability to extreme weather .  isaac wrote :   " the opinion held by some - - - that galveston at some time will be seriously damaged by some such disturbance is simply an absurd delusion .  "  he made this statement in spite of the fact that the maximum elevation of galveston island ,  at that time ,  was an almost trivial 8 . 7 feet above sea level .  he made it also in spite of the two killer hurricanes hitting and destroying the town of indianola ,  about 150 miles southwest of galveston on matagorda bay .cline had a  " model "  of gulf hurricanes ,  namely that no hurricane could ever hit galveston ,  as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as galveston .  his  " model "  of these storms was clearly fatally flawed ,  or politically influenced ,  and it resulted in 6 , 000 to 10 , 000 deaths .larson suggests there was a  " scent of boosterism "  behind this article ,  and that he was writing an article that galveston promoters would be happy to see .  could this have been a harbinger of things to come ?  could cline have been the first government weather scientist to prostitute himself by writing favorable papers on the weather for his sponsors ?then the storm hit .  both the u .  s .  weather service and isaac cline looked very arrogant before the storm ,  and also in defending their overall performance ,  after the storm .other extreme weather eventslarson also covered two blizzards and one flash flood in his book in this book .* hail and flash flood ,  august 1885 -  " a severe downpour near san angelo ,  including hailstones the size of ostrich eggs ,  killed hundreds of cattle and created a flash flood with an escarpment of water that isaac estimated to be 15 or 20 feet high .  "* blizzard ,  november 1888 - this surprise blizzard destroyed 150 vessels off new england ,  and caused the death of 450 .* blizzard ,  january 1899 -  " this blizzard swept much of the south .  icebergs 10 feet high flowed down the mississippi past new orleans .  "  this storm even hit galveston and piled snow on it's beaches and drove water out of the bay into the gulf exposing portions of the bay bottom .conclusionisaac's storm shows the incredoble wrath of hurricanes ,  105 to 125  years ago .  it also depicts the incredible spectrum of extreme weather events ,  also of the same vintage .  all in all a most interesting and rewarding book ,  one that i would recommend highly .
the best book i read in the past year .   the truth hurts
i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series .   years later i read s is for silence and was hooked .  i started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning .   i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine  ( and forgiven ms .  grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6 "  frame )  .   however ,  i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best .   you just can't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating ,  remaining in an incredibly  ( and unbelievable )  dangerous situation ,  to name a few .   the dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous ,  and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics .   but even with these issues ,  i did finish the book .   grafton at her low point is still a good read
this is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself .  this makes it a largely indispensable supplement ,  handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism .  this is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated ,  and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear .  the reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as renan ,  max weber and stalin  ( although the views of marx and engels themselves or lord acton and friedrich meinecke would have been welcome additions )  and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars  ( gellner ,  anderson ,  connor ,  a .  smith ,  etc .  )  .  the texts are well-selected and organized ,  and it really contributes to making a very complex subject and a daunting field of scholarship seem a little easier to grasp
you probably know joel siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on good morning america .   but do you know the rest of the story ?   here's a chance to find out .mr .  siegel became a father for the first time at age 54 ,  and his son ,  dylan ,  was born on the day mr .  siegel finished chemotherapy for colorectal cancer .   that cancer later spread to his lungs ,  and two more cancer surgeries and treatments followed .   mr .  siegel's marriage did not last ,  but his love for dylan did .   realizing that his chances of living to see dylan grow up are limited ,  mr .  siegel decided to write down all of the wonderful things he wanted to share with dylan over the next few decades  .   .   .  but might not be able to .   the result is a touching memoir with a heart that will cause you to shed more than an occasional tear while appreciating mr .  siegel's love for his son .mr .  siegel writes well ,  has had many interesting experiences ,  and retains his sense of wonder .   he is open about many of his faults  ( which have led to failed marriages )  ,  but remains cautiously optimistic  .   .   .  and careful .dedicating the material to his son makes the memoir more personal and meaningful than almost any other memoir that i have read .   anyone with an open heart would enjoy and benefit from this book .if you are like me ,  you expected to mainly hear about the movies  .   .   .  and you will .   but there's much more in the book about mr .  siegel's family ,  jewish heritage  ( there's even a yiddish dictionary with hilarious definitions )  ,  illnesses ,  past marriages ,  and advice for dylan .   the show business stories are almost all ones that i had not heard before ,  and will reward those who are primarily looking for this feature .   although you might think these are only about the movies ,  he also was a music critic and got to know the beatles in the early days .i was particularly interested by mr .  siegel's first-hand accounts of working for civil rights in the south ,  helping with bobbie kennedy's campaign ,  and how he helped his wife ,  jane ,  with her fatal illness .one of the thoughts you will have as you read this book is how you would write a parallel one for either your children or your grandchildren to play the same role in sharing knowledge and love across the generations .   i hope you will read this book and feel inspired to either transmit your own lessons in your own way  .   .   .  or to create the book you want to share with your descendants .in any case ,  keep a hanky handy !
" gpu gems 2 "  edited by matt pharr  ( addison-wesley ,  2005 ,  isbn 0-321-33559-7 )  is a collection of forty-eight white papers that detail cutting edge techniques based on today's latest graphical processing units  ( gpu )  .   the full color hardcover text is 784 pages and includes a cd-rom with working demos and source for some of the articles presented in the book .   the text retails for $59 . 99 .the book is divided into six parts :  geometric complexity ,  shading ,  high-quality rendering ,  general purpose computation on the gpu ,  image oriented computing ,  and numerical algorithms .   a part has anywhere from five to twelve chapters .   each chapter is written by a different author but the format and style is consistent .   the chapters have an introduction ,  discussion of the problem or technique ,  conclusion ,  and references .   the material is presented with color illustrations and occasionally some pseudo-code or code fragments .   generally ,  the material is extremely current and very approachable to read .as a sequel to its well received predecessor ,  the text focuses on taking advantage of the computational power and features of today's high-powered gpu boards .   the first part of the book ,  geometric complexity ,  emphasizes this with chapters dedicated to batch rendering ,  using multi-streaming ,  hardware occlusion ,  and displacement pixel-shaders .   each chapter illustrates how operations traditionally performed on the cpu can be moved into the gpu for efficiency and greater effect .the subsequent two parts on shading and rendering continue along the same theme :  improved performance by using hardware functionality found on the gpu .   each topic considers the performance ramifications and gpu capabilities when discussing the problem domain of a rendering technique and factors it into the final solution .   for example ,  chapter 10 considers irradiance environment maps for fast lighting - but with a twist - using the gpu to do the calculations in real-time .   in doing so ,  the book's real value becomes apparent .the fourth part on general purpose gpu computation is an interesting addition to the text .   the chapters illustrate methods of offloading traditional cpu tasks by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of modern gpu hardware .   since the book features nvidia hardware ,  the architecture and performance capabilities largely focused on their products .in the fifth part of the book ,  hardware assisted image creation and analysis is considered .   by using context clues from the spatial ,  texture ,  or lighting data - additional refinements can be made to a scene prior to rasterization .   the topics presented in this part are further refinements of the text's main theme  ( using the gpu fully )  and are specific solutions to uncommon problems - or approaches to rasterization .   none the less as gpus continue to evolve ,  the topics presented in this section will undoubtedly become more common .finally ,  the sixth part of the book provides several non-traditional graphics examples to illustrate calculating data on the gpu :  solving linear equations ,  options pricing ,  and numerical simulation - just to name a few .  as using the raw floating point power of modern gpu is a growing trend - these sections were quite interesting and well done .the included cd-rom contains examples to 28 of the 48 articles in the book .   in most cases ,  the example material includes source code as well as pre-compiled binaries to help illustrate the topic presented in the text .    in order to run the majority of the samples ,  cg must be installed on the host computer .   in addition ,  the cd-rom provides access to nvidia's software development kit ,  cg toolkit ,  performance tools ,  and several helpful reference links to on-line sites .gpu gems 2 provides a cutting edge view of the capabilities found in today's video cards .   the selected articles illustrate that every part of the rendering process can be enhanced in some fashion by fully using the underlying hardware .   as such ,  this book is essential to anyone working with modern gpus .
it&#8217 ; s been two years since the recovery of the amulet of samarkand ,  and nathaniel  ( now known as john mandrake )  is a government official in the office of internal affairs ,  apprenticed to jessica whitwell .his job is to hunt down a pack of rebellious commoners known as the resistance ,  who have been causing a series of disturbances in london ,  aiming to destabilize the rule of the magicians .   he suspects the involvement of a girl named kitty and her friends whom we met in his previous adventure ,  and although correct in this assumption ,  it soon becomes obvious that there is deeper evil afoot ,  as a destructive force hidden in a black cloud begins attacking the city ,  destroying buildings and magical artifacts as it goes .when things start spiraling out of control ,  he is forced to call upon bartimaeus again for help ,  and the adventure spirals into a saga of grave robbery ,  political maneuvers ,  foreign travel and ancient magic .though certainly not as good as the first ,  and a little too long ,  the golem&#8217 ; s eye makes for good reading ,  but is sadly lacking the sarcastic witticisms of everyone&#8217 ; s favorite djinn that were the high point of book one .amanda richards ,  may 20 ,  2006
while not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as aquinas or pannenberg  ( as another review here stresses )  ,  this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence .   this is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of scriptural data concerning each topic ,  its apologetic engagement with differing views ,  and its practical counsel for life and ministry .   it is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions .   i recommend it highly
i have spent a lot of time and money researching into mormon history .  the big problem is that ,  as henry ford once said  " history is bunk "  .  with joseph smith and the history of the mormon church ,  there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many ,  an ingenious charlatan .  there are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide .  hence ,  using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of joseph smith can be a very frustrating  ( and sometimes expensive )  exercise .  the church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony ,  but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony .  it is easy to see from my statement above ,  why .this book takes a completely different approach in investigating the truthfulness of what joseph smith produced .  forget about what might have happened in the early 1800's and instead ,  focus on the actual record contained in the book of mormon itself .  let current day investigation be the basis for the search of truth instead of historical personal accounts .  this removes any bias of the source material and hence allows for an objective study .thomas stuart ferguson starts out as the book of mormon's most enthusiastic proponent .  he sacrifices a large portion of his life both petitioning the first presidency for financial support ,  and performing extensive archaeological expeditions to find evidence of the civilisations documented in the book of mormon  ( bofm )  .  while he expects an abundance of material to be discovered ,  he finds none .  nothing .  no evidence of the language or writings contained within the bofm ,  the animals and crops mentioned ,  artefacts ,  city names ,  weapons ,  metals ,  glass etc .  nothing for the period documented within the bofm  ( 2500 bc - 400 ad )  .  there are few discoveries outside this timeline ,  but none within .  all he wanted  ( and expected )  to find were actual artefacts or at least murals/pictorials showing the above documented items .the turning point came when fragments of the joseph smith papyri were rediscovered in the late 1960's and found to contain nothing in common with the book of abraham .  this is a completely separate quest in itself  ( see  " by his own hand upon papyrus "  )  .while ferguson may have lost his faith ,  he never left the lds church and continued to attend and support it - he even sent a son on a mission .  he believed the mormon church was  " the best fraternity on earth "  .  in public ,  he was a  " normal "  member ,  in private circles he believed joseph smith was a fraud and as a result ,  spent the remainder of his life researching why .this book is both a document detailing ferguson's quest for the truth ,  and his way of dealing with it from the result .
once again ,  david mccullough's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind .  this biography reads like a fascinating novel ,  and mcculloughs narrative ability is unmatched .  no one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can .the great theodore roosevelt ,  known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong ,  tough ,  larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling .  the book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage ,  the man who would become president of the united states .best of all is that mccullough likes and admires his subject .  this is not always the case with biographies .  roosevelt and his family are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve .  highly recommended ,  as are all of mccullough's books
this book provides you with numerous analytical tools that can be used to quantify the strategic decision making process .  not a real page turner but the models are useful and the case analysis provides real world examples of companies entering strategic crossroads .  overall i think it provides the reader with a pragmatic way of managing the abundance of information involved in the strategic decision making process

this book is the best book on rand's esthetics i've ever read ;  in fact ,  it is the only book on the topic that i know of .   it is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical ;  they are not slavish cultists  savoring every last word written by rand .   they approach the material with  critical distance and do an excellent job of placing rand's work in the  larger history of esthetic theory .   they demolish abstract art ,  and devote  considerable energy to discussing rand's definition of art .   they even  propose their own individual alternatives !    if anything shows  independence ,  it is this willingness to debate the differences between the  authors of the same work !   remarkable !   the world of rand commentary is  filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship .   that is clear just  by reading one of the reviews here ,  by people who are devotees of certain  &quot ; scholars&quot ;  who do nothing but repeat the catechism .   they take  swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published ;  that is why  they hate this book .   because it is independent-minded .   judge for  yourself .   don't be fooled
i really liked this one because of the characters .  .  .  and of course the background being about wine .  .  and the lifestyle of those who create it  :  )   i definitely recommend this one .
in the  " new work of dogs ,  " author jon katz expands his scope from focusing on his relationship with his dogs---a topic he has detailed in previous books---to examining the canine-human relationship on a broader scale .informed by arduous research  ( a two foot stack of papers ,  books ,  journals )  ,  he sets out and succeeds in making a case that dogs ,  by-and-large ,  are doing different work from their traditional herding ,  hunting ,  and guarding .  we have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions ,  therapy dogs ,  even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world .the notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new ,  but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of  " the greatest generation "  is new  ( at least to me )  .mr .  katz visits with many dogs and their owners of various social economic strata who inhabit the enclaves of montclair ,  new jersey .   more often than not ,  he found that dogs are being used as emotional surrogate ,  a classic situation noted in attachment theory but hitherto mostly applied to other people .  many of these dogs are pampered ,  untrained ,  and confused .  others are abused to some extent ,  whether through deliberate actions or through negligence .the stories are alarming and informing .  i see many of the mistakes i made with previous dogs laid out before me and wonder if my two australian shepherds are as well-adjusted as they seem .many reviewers have commented ,  and correctly ,  that anyone planning to own a dog needs to read this book .  sadly ,  i think mr .  katz will largely reach those people who already possess a great deal of knowledge about dogs---those who train their dogs ,  who buy or adopt breeds suitable for their living conditions or schedules ,  and who treat their dogs with consistent ,  loving authority .mr .  katz does not make harsh judgments on any of the circumstances he depicts but instead concludes by noting how many dogs are dumped in shelters where they languish or die .  the numbers are staggering .and he takes matters a step further with the thought-provoking idea that if we have dog rescue groups ,  how can we not also have their counterparts to reach out to those of our own species in dire need .
in general the book provides some simple tips of how to help your children to learn reading by having fun and develop a taste for reading .  it worked for me ,  and i would recommend it for parents that are eager to provide their children with a push for developing this important skill
i liked track of the cat ,  but i didn't love it .  the idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one i found appealing ,  but the plot was ,  at times ,  predictable .  the setting was well-drawn ,  but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional .  the clincher ,  though ,  is that i'm not sure yet just how captivating anna pigeon is as a main character .  i believe that this is her first story ,  so i don't want to make a snap judgement ,  but anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a sherlock holmes or miss marple .  that would be expecting a lot ,  i know ,  but frankly she isn't even as engaging as ,  say ,  gideon oliver or sharon mccone or brother cadfael ,  and she lacks the depth and power of a harry bosch .as i said ,  the jury is still out for me here .  i liked track of the cat ,  but i wasn't wild about it .  it's a solid first try ,  and i'll certainly read another anna pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series .  i expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable .  i recommend it ,  but my recommendation is a mild one
i disagree with the reviewer who said that this book does not offer solutions .   again and again the author reports that people need to be heard ,  and need to stop repressing emotions to get well .   as a counselor working with battered women ,  i was amazed at the number of them who also had auto-immune disorders such as fibromyalgia .   this book is a must read
this is a great devotional book .   the book uses an engaging ,  real-life story to set the context .   i read it with my kids every night and they look forward to the little story and they take turns guessing the correct behavior .   the included bible reference provides the ultimate answer and it is a great way to introduce bible teaching to the kids
this book has adrenaline written all over it !  michael crighton did an excellent job of keeping readers on their seats .  i was blown away .  not only did his novel have adrenaline ,  but it also had horror ,  which kept you waiting for your hand to turn the next page
don't get me wrong this was a really good book .   and i am so close to giving it 5 stars .   it was just a little too short for me .   the story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core .   the only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game .   you will fly through this book ,  it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it ,  even after that mild short coming i mentioned .   just my opnion ,  i could be wrong
first off this is  " a history of hollywood "  not  " the history of hollywood .  "   david thomson isn't writing the chronological ,  straight-up ,  blow-by-blow account of hollywood movies .    " the whole equation "  is an essay that takes as its question ,   " are hollywood films ever art like a beethoven symphony or a picasso painting ?  "   he says they are both more and less than that .   more because american film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen .   that serendipity is wonderful when it works which isn't often .   less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits .and unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension .   his argument is that to understand and appreciate american film ,  you have to understand that it's always about the money and about the art .   that means it is never truly art in any pure way  ( but is any art truly pure ?  )  .  to tell you the truth ,  i don't think the book succeeds that well on that level .   he  points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of american film but he doesn't developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight .for me ,  that just didn't matter .   what makes it a terrific read is that david thomson knows and loves film .   he writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic .   he uses the film  " chinatown "  as his framing device and as that is my all-time favorite movie ,  i was in heaven .   he is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater ,  the audience ,  the actors ,  the costumes ,  the music ,  all of it .   he constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film ,  you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride .
this is the best book on creating wealth that i've ever read .  study this book .  it's full of action points .  .  .  not a bunch of fluff
i am nearly finished with this book - i haven't been this mesmerized by a book in forever !  i would certainly recommend it
&quot ; i&quot ;  is for i think you would like this book if you read it .   it was a little bit wordy at the beginnig but each page gets better than the one before .   you will be glad you got past the first few pages because it gets a lot more interesting as you go along .   and the ending of this book is really something else ,  it makes the whole book well worth reading .   i really liked the book and i think you will too
overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a do .  the mix of recipes is fine ,  but they just seemed to be missing something .  they were all more or less of the &quot ; huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done&quot ;  variety .  all of the recipes look tasty ,  though i would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes ,  especially some more creative ones .  let's be honest ,  when you pay for a book you'd like to see more than &quot ;  .  .  . put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated dutch oven ,  salt and pepper to taste ,  cook until done . &quot ;  give me a little something to work with here !  inspire me !  i can already cook a roast like this in the oven .  having said all of that ,  i would still reccommend this book .  the vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and i can't wait to try some of them .  as an aside ,  this is the only dutch oven book i've seen with heart-healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare .  given that the average do book requires the use of a metric ton of lard ,  this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks
i enjoyed reading the mark .  it was definitely a page turner .  of course it makes me want to continue with the series .  tim f .  lahaye is a great author and story teller .  i actually visualized the whole the thing .  i would thank him in person if i could ,  for a wonderful job done .  .  .thank you .  .
i'm not even a vegetarian  ,  let alone a vegan ,  and this book offers such flavorful and simple recipes .   some more time consuming than others but definitely worth the wait !   unless you hate veggies ,  this book is a must have !   i just made the herb scalloped potatoes as a side dish and the author was right ,  it's hard to believe there's no cheese or cream !  the pizza with caramelized onions ,  kalmata olives and tomatoes is fantastic too !  .   .   .   .   . lots of yummyness
this is wonderful !  it is for fans of laura ingalls wilder ,  and also for those who are interested in historic cooking - from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled america in the early days ,  and adapted for use therethis book is a very happy blend of the laura ingalls stories and the food which was eaten ,  interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked .  of course laura didn't include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day .  it has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures .i found this book so lovely to read through ,  not just browse through .  the interest factor is great - learning what things were available ,  and how they were used - baking soda ,  yeasts ,  how the oven was used ,  what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget - seasonal food avaialble .  but it is good as a simple recipe book .  it is an incredible look at times gome pastone of my best reads in the last few years ,  i also bought a prairie cookbook which i would highly recommend as well - it is more of a recipe book than this one ,  but a lovely complementary book to it
like a mystery novel at first then like a fictional joke but crazy as it sounds it works .  it is intresting to apply the guidlines bob recommends for getting out of the rut of lifes financial strifes and other problems of life .  i found it easy to understand and even if it challenges your lifes beliefs keep reading  .  good stuf
i am nearly finished with this book - i haven't been this mesmerized by a book in forever !  i would certainly recommend it
how can people play the game if they don't know the rules or how to keep score ?   open book management means you teach people how business works ,  you share financials and you reward them for improving the profits of the company .   good solid &quot ; how to&quot ;  information if you want to set up a profit sharing plan and get people really involved in the success of the company
here is a book written for literally anyone who wants to learn lessons for life on how to get rich .  and for all those desperados out there dreaming of getting fantastically rich with ridiculously little effort :  here is your guide .  you will learn that making money and getting rich isn't hard at all ,  but it requires a little discipline .  there are only a handful of tips given in this book ,  but they are sufficient to make a real difference in your wallet and a real difference in your life !the style is very easy to understand and very straight-forward .  a child could read this book ,  even though the setting is that of the ancient city of babylon ,  but that makes the story and the lesson all the more interesting .  five stars are awarded to this book and trust me ,  you'll agree with me
i am a longtime jance fan and wasn't disappointed with dead wrong .   any complaints would be the overemphasis on joanna's pregnancy with a concomitant under-emphasis on tension and suspense  ( great ending ,  though !  )  .   butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book ,  but  also comes across as overly self-absorbed ,  especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child .   jenny ,  too has little to add to the story .   but joanna shines ,  as usual .  nice to see such a reliable ,  ethical ,  and strong female protagonist
i had eyed this book for quite some time before i purchased it ,  and i am so glad i did !   the pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book !   most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based ,  so don't pick this book up looking for lots of kid-friendly drinks  ( though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy ,  such as a s'mores hot chocolate )  .   the recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes .   order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty ,  piping hot drinks
well ,  the name of this set does say it all .  fashion !  that's the theme of this mix & match stationery set .  i liked it a bit more than some of the other mix & match stationery sets out there .  the paper quality is a teensy bit better with this set as the paper is slightly thicker .the illustrations are very colorful and pretty ,  it has drawings and he complements each with colors such as bright blue and fuchsia .  the drawings are all bold and enjoyable ranging from a pattern of high-heeled shoes or little kisses to a close-up of a very warhol-esque face .  at the top of each sheet ,  there are little quotes of andy's relating to fashion .  very cool for maintaining the overall theme ,  i think .  the different colored-envelopes each have a flap that more or less complements one of the particular sheet designs but of course ,  as the name suggests ,  it's all open to a little mix&match .  finally ,  there are quite a lot of stickers to decorate your mail as your will dictates .  they're very pretty too including purses ,  mannequins ,  kisses ,  and oh ,  they're the clear kind so they look a little bit more distinguished .all in all ,  a very good way to spruce up your everyday mail .  get it especially if you're a fan of andy warhol or a die-hard fashionista
if you're interested in reproducing authentic costumes ,  you won't find a better guide to hats and bonnets than this book .   i haven't found anything close to it .   intended for collectors ,  it is full of photographs showing what women wore on their heads for the 200 year period covered .   today a hat is usually something worn strictly to protect from inclement weather .   until a generation or so ago ,  no woman felt dressed in public unless she wore some kind of hat .   it's a valuable addition to any costume library
hal zina bennett's profound advice from his prolific writing career  ( over 30 published books )  is ,  &quot ; write from the heart&quot ;  .   as wonderful as that sounds ,  most writers know it's not an easy thing to do .   	hal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader .  i can speak from my own personal experience ,  having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book ,  &quot ; sacred woman ,  sacred dance :   awakening spirituality through movement and ritual&quot ;  .  	&quot ; write from the heart&quot ;  also offers practical guidance in several areas .   this includes such things as the need for solitude .   however ,  he is not just talking about having &quot ; a quiet space&quot ;  ,  he goes beyond the physical to the inner - a state of mind .   he says ,  &quot ; once we know what it is ,  what it looks like and feels like ,  we can create it for ourselves ,  almost--i say &quot ; almost&quot ; --regardless of where we happen to be . &quot ;   	i would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published
while i agree with several people who don't consider this chick-lit ,  i don't see why that is a bad thing .  i enjoyed radish's writing style ,  purple prose and all .  if you're expecting a dickensian journey into a complex character ,  this book is not it .  however ,  it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life .yes ,  the  ( positive and negative )  circumstances of meg's life were unrealistic ,  but i felt they were dramatized to make a point .  we all have strong ,  kind ,  and amazing people in our lives ,  but we have to look for these things in people .  i had an aunt just like marcia ,  who fought her battles with a fantastic sense of humor ,  courage ,  and love for everyone around her .  the message i took from this book is this - life can be all you want if you simply take the time to nourish your own strength and that of those around you .  it doesn't take money to be powerful and satisfied with your life
i'll skip the description since that has been done so many times here .  but i would like to say that i don't have much time for reading ,  so make sure the books i choose are those by authors i consider 5-star .  j . d .  robb a/k/a nora roberts is one of the most prolific authors i've ever read .  how she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination .  i've read this series out of order ,  but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone .  this one ,  however ,  revealed to me the reason behind eve's sometimes belligerent attitude ,  her strong persona ,  and standoffishness .  robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts ,  inner turmoils .  great book
fabulously entertaining novel from martin amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing `information . ' john self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials .  he is an alcoholic ,  a misogynist ,  and a microcosm of mainstream american culture in the 1980's .  john has also landed a gig directing a feature film ,  titled `good money , ' and `bad money , ' depending on what day of the week it is .  amis' writing is mordantly brilliant ;  both acerbic and biting .  there are transactions in here that i just love ,  such as john's stinging interactions with his girlfriend selina :"  `i've just gone off sex , ' said selina this morning ,  as she finished the tea i fondly brought her .`so ? ' i asked her .`god ,  be nice .  use your imagination .  it'll pass .  i've just gone off sex . 'then what do you think is the point of you ?  i wanted to say .  but i didn't .  i resisted the temptation .  i looked into the proud drama of her face ,  the valves and orbits of her throat ,  the wetlook runnels of her hair ,  the breasts ,  heavier than ever ,  solidly mounted on the ribcage ,  the naked slopes of the belly ,  the sudden flaring of the hips ,  a smell of sleep .`then what do you think is the point of you ? '`you' ,  she said ,  `are unreal'  ( 226 )  .you should read amis for his remarkable power of description ,  his talent for black comedy and middle-aged disillusionment .  pay little heed to his flights into post-modernity ,  they are merely exercises in literary chic .
with over 1000 recipes ,  this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it's paces ,  but i've had great results with the few dishes i've tried so far .   the turkey wraps with chipotle mayo rocked ,  with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion .   i'd use that on any sandwich ,  anytime .   the sauces for halibut with spicy asian vinaigrette  ( really a sambal vinaigrette )  and wasabi cream were awesome .   veggie dishes like asparagus with shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners .granted ,  i haven't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good !   i picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10 . 00 for it - about a penny a recipe !   what a deal
ordinary joy reminds you that god is in fact all around you in your ordinary living if you just take a break from all the hustle and bustle and truly appreciate his beauty .  joe campeau uses personal illustrations that we can relate to ,  and in turn ,  relates them to the teachings of jesus .  on a personal note ,  my own faith has waivered for quite some time that after taking a  " closer look ,  "  i am rediscovering god's presence in my life and i know that ,  no matter what ,   " the sun will shine tomorrow and i will be kissed by son again and again and it can never be wiped away .  "  peace and joy
you can always depend on the o'reilly  " learning "  series to provide an excellent detailed introduction to any language .   you will be up and running after you read this book .my only complaint is the same material was covered several times as it was expanded in detail .
i've read this book four times through the years since i first bought it .   the love between the two main characters ,  though a forbidden love ,  is so beautiful and magical it made me cry for meggy and father ralph .not only is this an unforgettable love story ,  it's also a great education about sheep farming in australia .   magnificent description of a then harsh land .   the dialogue is believable ,  the characters so very real  .  .  .   i didn't simply read this book ,  i experienced it .   when the characters laughed ,  i laughed ,  and when they cried ,  my heart broke for them .poor little meggy  .  .  .  poor father ralph .   how bittersweet and memorable .i really can't get over the quality of this book and the sensitivity of the author .review by betty dravis ,  author of a new epic love story ,  1106 grand boulevar
here's a book that would have made a great spreadsheet .  there's a lot of data here ,  displayed via a string of pictographs .  text in this book serves to provide directions only .i would have rated this higher if it provided a little background on the location ,  the history ,  geographic features ,  etc
this is the story of another tragic episode involving a native american tribe .   that this probably happened under other circumstances ,  and happened to more than the arapaho tribe ,  cannot be doubted .   this is another in a  series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to  leave  us wanting more .   the characters are strong ,  believable ,  and you want the  best for all of them .  the underlying plot--selling tribal babies and  telling their parents they died--is heartbreaking .   the reunion of one such  child with her father made me weep .   and vicki's trial reconciliation with  ben gave me hope .   this is a great work ,  written with deep feeling
is this a book of new yorker cartoons or a puzzle book ?   well ,  it's a little of both ,  and the result is a novel way to laugh and exercise your brain at the same time .  most of the 83 puzzles consist of cartoons that are missing words ,  captions ,  or picture components .  by figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics ,  crossword puzzles ,  or other word grids ,  the cartoon humor is revealed .for the most part ,  the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty ,  although there are a few difficult ones  ( at least for me )  that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonist's career .  frequent puzzle solvers will recognize many of the familiar puzzle types from games magazine and other media that puzzability publishes in .  the foreword to the book contains a casual and loosely coupled conversation between new yorker cartoon editor robert mankoff and new york times puzzle editor will shortz .this is an entertaining book that you'll hate to throw away when it's been completed because of all the witty cartoons it contains .  enjoy !eileen riebac
this is a 4 cd set of meditations as a companion to the inner temple of witchcraft book .   using the background of the book ,  the cd's set up an easy way to work with the material in the book without having to open the book to reference it during the mediations .mr .  penczak's voice is perfect as far as i am concerned ,  it does not grate on you nor does it lull you into sleep .   the light melodic fill is just that ,  filler for the spaces between words and does not distract from the words .i found the material covered to be good for meditation and it works well with the material in the book .   if you find the book to be what you are looking for ,  the cd's are a good addition .i enjoyed the entire presentation ,  and mr .  penczak gives us some very well based and solid material .  boudic
this collection of stories and essays by david sedaris definitely contains a lot of variety .   overall ,  i found the way the stories were dripping with sarcasm delightful .   some stories were a bit dry ,  but others such as  " santaland diaries "  and  " diary of a smoker "  had me laughing out load .   however ,  the best stories i found were the ones such  " season's greetings to our friends and family !  !  !  "  which i had to think about before fully understanding and laughing at their humor .   i would definitely like to read more of sedaris' works ,  especially those based on his real-life experiences as ,  overall ,  i found the collection of essays in this book more entertaining than the stories
hugh hewitt is right on target encouraging republicans to remain loyal to president george w .  bush .   we are confronted with a long term fight against islamic nihilists .   the democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s .   indeed ,  if the democratic party returns to power ,  the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost .   even theological modernists like myself recognize that the republican party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order .   and yes ,  we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like senator lincoln chafee .   but what about the republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands ?   these folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006 .   many of them possess a suicidal nietzschean streak .   in their heart of hearts ,  they idiotically believe we should let the democrats win so that the republican party can be  " purified .  "   the author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis .   hopefully ,  he starts to do so real soon before it's too late .the crybaby republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue .   a number of them come across as nativists who despise hispanics .   we cannot ,  however ,  forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often american citizens .   they get to vote at the age of 18---and will most certainly seek revenge on the gop for harassing their parents .   let's get something straight :  we are also not going to send an estimated 10-12 million people back to their original homeland .   but aren't these individuals breaking the law ?   human law is not about the striving for utopian perfection .   yucky sausage making compromises are occasionally required .   i may have a few complaints about hugh hewitt's newest book .   still ,  you need to purchase a copy .   his overall advice is indispensable if you truly love your family and wish to protect the united states from ruin .david thomsonflares into darkness
this is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened .  it does not deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse  ( the author explicitly states this on many occasions )  and the reviewer who suggested that this is  " a terrific book if you are child molester "  probably  ( i guess )  didn't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy .the author shows how even trained professionals can disregard overwhelming evidence against a particular hypothesis  ( repressed memory/mpd/satanic cults )  and rely on their intuition to  ( unintentionally )  wreak havoc with their clients lives .  in the upside-down world of some therapists ,  lack of hard evidence is trumped by strength of feeling for even the most outrageous accusation .  pendergrast demonstrates how uncertain and malleable human memory can be .the book is written in an easy style and despite what another particularly stupid review suggests ,  concentrates specifically on the scientific evidence for his claims
this isn't really a novel and it isn't really a collection of short stories ,  but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons .   alan lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time ,  as he imagines einstein envisioned them .   each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time :   time is money ,  time flows uphill ,  live in the present - forget the past ,  time is motion ,  etc .lightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing ,  each could be the setting for powerful stories .   it's a quick read ,  a fun read ,  and well worth the 'time .

i'm not the expert fencer i long to be  ( yet )  ,  but i do have an ever-growing collection of swords ,  mostly gifts from grateful spanish patrons ,  but i've also been able to purchase and acquire blades from several countries .  the pride of my collection is a fairly well-preserved roman sword from the reign of trajan .burton was ,  as we all know ,  something of a dabbler .  in this book ,  he offers us not only straight history of the sword ,  but also countless fascinating bits of sword lore .  i quite frankly can't imagine any sword lover being without this book .i am looking for a first edition ,  but for now ,  this reprint is a valued part of my library
this book explains in simple terms all the stuff that the other one's don't explain .  it's one of the best books on photography hands down .it's clearly the next step in amature photography you will need . i am currently waiting for it to arrive at my door .  i have read it already .i want to own it so i have it forever .  i plain on absorbing every comma ,  period and explaination mark ,  and explaining it to everyone .my hat's off to the author .  i like it
since i am a world's fair  " fanatic "  i have read almost everything that i can on the subject .  in general ,  this is an interesting and well researched book .  the author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about .  however ,  i must point up three rather glaring errors in the book .  in describing the louisiana world expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be  " 80 feet tall , just 150 feet shorter than the eiffel tower .  "  since the eiffel tower is actually over 900 feet tall , the new orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall . this may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time . the other error states that the us pavilion at the brussels world's fair of 1958 was a  " large , squat , round concrete block structure .  "  it was indeed large and round ,  but not squat and not made of concrete blocks . according to the excellent book about edward durrell stone ,  the architect of the pavilion , the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light .  i have seen photos of the us pavilion ,  and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me .   ( in comparison to the soviet pavilion ,  which resembled a large refrigerator !  )  thirdly ,  the spokane expo of 1974 was not the first time that the u . s . s . r .  exhibited at a u . s .  expo .  they had a large pavilion at the new york world's fair of 1939 .  all in all ,  however ,  i would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of world's fairs
there is about as much additional science in social intelligence ,  compared to emotional intelligence ,  as you could write on a postcard  :  mirror neurones and spindle cells .    nevertheless ,  we can be thankful that daniel goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way .   firstly ,  it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness ,  which is goodness .   secondly ,  it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format .   note that this already existed in emotional intelligence ,  but was not so clearly called out .the most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fmri studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of inter-personal relationships to psychic ecology .   a question-mark would be against the reliance on seligman's and csikszentmihalyi's questionnaire based results .   questionnaire psychology is frustratingly limited in the gap between the suggestive nature of the results and the impossibilty of distinguishing between correlation and cause-effect
as usual ,  robin cook keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end .excellent reading
one of the best !  you cannot go wrong reading this as an intro to islam .  truly an insiders look .  a must read for everyone who loves freedom
i really like this book it was well written and enjoyable . the characters in it were very interesting to read about .  i like the way that imogene and maxine stayed friends all the way through the book .  the two girls really seemed to bring out the best in each other . maxine never thought imogene was crazy because of the strange things that happened .  maxine just believed her and helped her through everything .  overall it was a well written book with very good characters and it showed what friendship really is
this book has a photo of each dessert so you can see what you're making and easy recipes that look impressive ,  all using a cake mix box of some kind .   their snickerdoodle cake uses a white cake mix ,  some other ingredients ,  and includes a cinnamon buttercream frosting recipe .   yum !    i love the variety of recipes  ( bundts ,  bars ,  round ,  layered ,  etc .  )  and my kids and i can do many together .   i think the packaged cake mixes from the store have a nice taste ,  so these recipes just build on those mixes .   i just want easy recipes that aren't intimidating ,  and this book is the solution for that .    i highly reccommend the cake mix doctor .
having worked with vbscript for a little over four years i am by no means an expert ;  however ,  i feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting .  i was pretty skeptical when i saw the word  " advanced "  in the title ,  but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters .the book begins with securing  ( including digital certs and policies )  and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in wmi and adsi .  for me personally ,  the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with wsf and wsc files .  don and jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind xml functionality as well as it's application within the scripted files .  these guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies .  they wrap up the package peice with explanations around hta's and form controls in html scripts .the book moves on to cover topics such as adsi and ado scripting ,  working with wshcontroller and remote scripts ,  wmi and wql classes and techniques ,  and different applicable real world examples .  all this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug ,  sign ,  and package your scripts as well the wizards  ( wmi ,  adsi ,  wsf ,  etc )  and other tools available to make scripting easier .i've obtained quite a few vbscript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced vbscripting .  if you are new to scripting with vbscript ,  you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods ,  properties ,  classes ,  etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use .  while this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics ,  you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it .thumbs up !  highly recommended bang for the buck
i love this cookbook .  there are so many amazing recipes .  as someone who is allergic to dairy ,  i am totally blown away at how creamy some of the dishes are .  besides the recipes ,  the book is filled with beautiful pictures and profound quotes that combine together to create a really special reading experience .  i highly recommend this cookbook to vegans ,  vegetarians ,  people allergic to dairy and wheat ,  and meat eaters ,  as well
my hat's off to anyone who can sum up this book in a customer review .  it is beyond anything i've ever read in its portrayal of men at war as witnessed by the war correspondents who accompany them on the front lines .  unlike the embedded journalists of our own time ,  the writers and photographers who covered vietnam were much closer to being free agents ,  restricted only by their ingenuity and fearlessness to seek out the action that would represent the essence of america's military presence in southeast asia  (  " there it is  .   .   .  )  ,  while the evidence everywhere was of an irrationality raised to such a pitch that it had become something driven only bit itself .unable to remain objective or even conceive of objectivity ,  herr and his colleagues yield to a kind of hallucinatory experience ,  depicting the war as a phantasmagoria ,  a really bad trip that also seduced them with what one of them insists is a compelling glamour .  to read this book is to experience vietnam not as a historical record or analysis ,  or even a personal memoir ,  but as a kind of hypnotic nightmare from which many ,  including survivors ,  never wake
i consider myself knowledgeable about history ,  especially ww2 .  after reading just half of  " flags of our fathers' "  i realize how much i 'didn't' know about this part of the war .  most of my research was of the european theatre .i am so glad i purchased this book .  it makes me feel so humble as to my own time spent in uniform for i never had to endure or sacrifice what these young men did .anyone thinking of not voting should read this and be sure to vote for these young men gave everything so that we could have that right .  even more they went through hell before they did it .do yourself a favor and get this book .richard neal huffman - author of dreams in blue :  the real polic
as always ,  jeffrey's book is worth reading very much .  i have read the first version  ( edition )  ,  and i read this one again .  if you want to know lots of inside out about clr ,  this is the one to read .  this is a must-read book before you go for a job interview ,  because you are expected to have read it by lots of interviewers .
after reading a book of sandra brown's that i horribly disliked ,  i was hesitant to give her another shot .  i'm truly glad i did ;  the witness was a first-rate thriller !the villains in this book are greasy ,  sick individuals that rather turned my stomach .  .  . just what you like when you want to get a taste of why a person would run for their life !  sandra brown wrote these characters  ( and that of ricki sue-who i could easily picture !  )  particularly well .  the baby was truly the icing on the cake :  this infant motivated kendall throughout the book and ,  like any mother ,  lived for the love of her child .i also loved the sexy ,  romantic element here-it was just enough that it didn't overwhelm the story .  .  . even better ,  it didn't change kendall into a mindless goober  ( a state which many female characters in  " romance "  novels often achieve .  )the witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full five-star rating .  perhaps it was the crooks .  .  . they came off a bit cliche ,  but were still necessary characters .still ,  this book is an excellent ,  thought-provoking choice with a wow ending .  very enjoyable
were someone to write a biography of carl hiassin in fifty years it is hard to imagine that he or she wouldn't focus on the author's latest triumph ,  skinny dip .  it is one of his seminal achievements .  the book simply shines with humor ,  well drawn characters ,  action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts .  it is also one of his smoothest rides .  one gets the feeling that hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote .here is an overview that will stimulate readers' interest hiassin's .  the book opens with chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship ,  but by some twists and turns and luck joey survives long enough to be rescued .  much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as joey and her team pursue vengeance .  by the midpoint of the novel chaz is already an emotional wreck and it doesn't look like joey is about to let up any time soon .the moral backbone of the novel is twofold .  one is the pitting of the everglades forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants .  the everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed ,  which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business .  hiassin's two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book ,  but also lends it a feeling of seriousness .and two is the pitting of criminals against victims who aren't going to take it anymore .   hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to joey .  as most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to one's helplessness .there are six main characters in the book :  joey and her horny husband chaz ,  joey's rescuer mick who is a kind and eccentric ex-policeman who lives alone on an island ,  joey's brother ,  a rich expatriate who raises sheep in new zealand ,  mr .  hammernut ,  the owner of a large agricultural empire and tool ,  the books muscled goon who undergoes a moral transformation .  the small group of sub-characters is entertainingly populated in part with a hermit who lives in the swamp ,  a street-tough hairdresser ,  a slap-happy senior and a cowardly lawyer .though similar elements live in many of hiassin's works his books never feel like he has used a formula to create them more easily .  this can't be said for all or most of crime writers and should be accredited to hiassin's love for storytelling ,  his skill as a plot weaver and his ability to evoke so many different emotions .  in this line of thought this reviewer took note of the characters subtle  ( except for tool )  character changes throughout the book .  joey for example seemed learn a bit more restraint as she calmed down a little and the same can be said even for characters that have appeared in some of hiassin's previous works  ( mick )  .hiassin has never been a fan of superficial materialism ,  but the issue is slightly complicated by skinny dip and does not simply fall into place along character axes .  while the villains all crave money some of the heroes are loaded too .  joey maintains a very frugal existence considering her $ 13 million trust ,  but her brother spends lavishly .  joey's rescuer on the other hand lives on a disability check .  one may wonder if the only difference between chaz and his wife is that she never had to work or hustle for a buck ,  but there is one other way in which the enemies contrast and that is the way they treat their associates .  chaz is continuously scrambling for something and in his desperation - be it for sex ,  money ,  or escape - uses other people as tools rather than relating to them as equals .  on the other hand ,  joey has a good sense of humor and she enjoys the companionship of her pals .like most of hiassin's work this book is not an overly violent one .  although it begins with an attempted murder ,  the event is quite peaceful .  there is no struggle ,  no blood and the victim ,  joey ,  does not die .after reading skinny dip i immediately lent it to my best friend katie who has not been able to put it down .  so ,  potential readers be warned :  like katie you may not be able to get any work done for a day or two ,  but the time is not wasted on hiassin's best work to date .  one comes away gaining not only pleasant memories of laughs and smiles ,  but also the feeling that one has poured one more drop into the bucket of our minds that we must fill in order to make this world a better place .  in short ,  carl hiassin puts us in touch with the good guys in ourselves
wow - i had to have this book .  they are right ,  he explains everything wrong with oracle and all about vulnerabilities and exploits .
having read all of mccarthy's other books already ,  i came into this knowing what to expect as far a style and content .   and i was not disappointed .   mccarthy can better develop a character in two sentences than most authors can in two chapters .   the vivid description of the mountains ,  the people ,  and their culture puts the reader right there in the story .   these harsh ,  terse ,  and somehow always beautiful images will remain in my mind for a long ,  long time .       i found this story a little more abstract than most of mccarthy's other works ,  yet i was able to see his message in the end .   required reading for any mccarthy fan
this is one of nora roberts' best books ever !  i have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite .  i adore this book .   the characters are interesting and very human ,  the plot is gripping and the background fascinating .   callie ,  an archeologist ,  comes to a little town in maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband .  what i really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment ,  like most romances  ( including roberts )  .   definitely a book i highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot .   it will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are
this is a sci-fi novel about the end of the world .   every single adult on the planet died .   there are a couple of kids living in a house alone .   so begins the fire-us trilogy ,  fascinating ,  scary ,  and intriguing .the story is really interesting - i mean slap in your face ,  give-me-more ,  i love this intersting .   a couple of the images were really disturbing ,  though ,  like the fact that hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket .   the kids in the story are fascinating ,  and the teacher's scarpbook-thing was so  .   .   .  wierd that it was actually kind of scary .then angerman is introduced .   he's really messed up ,  but i get the idea that he knows something about the virus  ( fire-us )  that the others don't .   this makes him an amazing character ,  and even if you don't like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy .i really love this series ,  though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers .   well worth anyone who is into sci-fi and apocalypse ,  as i was at the time .p . s .  i read this book five months ago and i still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks .   talk about powerful writing
girl sleuth is a must-read especially for the over-50 nancy drew fan .   rehak's research is remarkable .   however ,  on p .  47 ,  rehak has mildred augustine headed west to the university of iowa from her hometown of ladora ,  iowa .   she would have headed east .   i have been teaching 30 years in the school district that now includes students from the town of ladora and have my own degree from iowa .   i've traveled highway 6 between ladora and iowa city many ,  many times .marcia nilleswhat cheer  i
this story gives me hope in mankind again .   despite the horrendous abuse ,  this woman gave herself -- all of herself -- to save a child from the torment she experienced .   i wish there were more people like torey hayden in this world .   i can only hope that i can touch lives in the way ms .  hayden has .   this book will open eyes to the terrors of abuse that does ,  indeed ,  occur in this world ,  despite the fact that we would like to close our eyes to it .   it also demonstrates the hope that victims can overcome and the need for us to step up to the plate to end this war of terror
when i thought there were not any more sex &quot ; techniques&quot ;  i could learn from a book ,  this book just amazed me . combined with stuff about how to make a lady feel special out of bed ,  this book can make you a better lover ,  husband or sex partner for sure .
mccain et al write very well and i was impressed by his style .   the writing was not the only style with which i became familiar but the  " style "  of the man himself ,  john mccain .   this was a truthful ,  revealing account of a man of honor who is presently in an oft less-than-honorable profession .   we can only hope the remainder of his career echoes with laud that of his grandfather and father .   i believe this read is one to add to one's readings of autobiographies / biographies .

highly recommended !  the text is engaging and very informative .   clear possibilities for implementation
gilbert ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor .  on page 16 ,  he writes :   " a foreign stranger visiting the oxford campus is shown libraries ,  department buildings ,  and museums .  then he asks  " but where is the university ?  "  .  this is the  " category mistake "  .  cartesian question  " where is the mind ?  "  has a same confusion ,  he asserts .a famous epigram  " ghost in the machine "  is sometimes misinterpreted .  his point is that there is no  " ghost "  .  what we think ghost  ( spirit )  does not exist  ( therefore ghost !  )  .although the philosophy of ordinary language and the logical behaviorism ,  the british school represented by wittgenstein and ryle ,  had an its apogee in 50's ,  its crux of reasoning still has an important element .  i still feel the current dominant school in cognitive science such as functionalism has a long way to go ,  before it can make it acceptable for broader spectrum of scientists whose prime mode of thinking is purely materialistic or physicalistic .
collins' efforts with his justly famed &quot ; the moonstone&quot ;  and &quot ; the woman in white&quot ;  have perhaps overshadowed his very fine work as seen in &quot ; armadale . &quot ;   lydia gwilt  ( don't you love the last name ?  )  is one of the great unsung characters in english  ( or any western )  literature .   collins seems to delight in making her as full-bodied ,  as attractive to men ,  and as dangerous as he can without ever losing his grip and falling over the slippery precipice into satire .   given the tenor and social conventions of the time ,  her quest for revenge on the despicable alan armadale seems perfectly in keeping .   lydia gwilt is like an early ,  english scarlett o'hara without the redeeming humor scarlett was known to exhibit .   all in all ,  an extraordinarily well-written and three-dimensional character study
never before have i been moved so completely by a simple reference book .  the author skillfully weaves his understanding of our democratic system with a profound love for l .  ron hubbard's dianetics -- not an easy task .  i bought this for my grandmother .  .  .  and she hates books .  that's how good this is .  &quot ; better than cats , &quot ;  she says .  i can't say i necessarily agree with her -- for starters ,  the private sector's influence on public policy and decision-making is nowhere near as entertaining as mister mistofellees' song and dance -- but who am i to argue with an old woman ?  nobody ,  that's who
eric carle's illustrations are beautiful and unusual .  the simply stated story is appropriate for the very young to school-age children .  the author incorporates math and science in a book you will wish to read again and again .  the story was a favorite for the children ,  ages two to five at the local library's story hour ,  and it was a favorite of mine to read to them .
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target .  .  .  .   craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation .  .  .  .the cover appealled to me for these reasons and i admit i was not at all disappointed in the movie .   the scenery was indeed spectacular .   the underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear ,  crisp ,  and just what the doctor ordered .   even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful .ok ,  enough of the shallow stuff .  .  .  .   the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick  " the deep "  which i enjoyed back then as well .   the characters of jared and sam were pretty believable - poor ,  honest ,  and happy folks  ( most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it !  )  the introduction of bryce  ( played by scott caan )  really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers ,  twists ,  etc .overall ,  the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives .   would i want to deal with tiger sharks ?   no ,  but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day .
this is a terrific movie regarding military life in the '60s .   jessica lange truly deserved her oscar and tommy lee is excellent and of course powers booth shows his narily side which he protrays so well in so many movies .   i can't even tell you how many times i have seen this movie and i will watch it again and again .
this continuation of the anne series on screen is very well done ,  and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did .   the only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers .   what it really does is just focus on a few key incidents ,  and drastically truncates anne's college and teaching experiences .   morgan harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of roy gardner ,  sophy sinclair ,  old mrs .  gibson and pauline ,  and elizabeth .   this installment ends with anne and gilbert becoming engaged .i highly recommend it - just don't expect the same level of detail as  " anne of green gables "  provided
this dvd is the best one ive ever seen snoop put out .  the concert footage and sound isnt the greatest but this dvd is so much more that i thought i was getting .  dont get me wrong the concert parts are so dope to hear my fav snoop classics and i was left with one question how did they get clearance from suge to put out his death row classics ,  but this dvd shines as a replayable classic .  you would be so so suprised at what is on this ,  see most people are happy getting a concert dvd like the up and smoke where snoop performs in one city ,  you watch it after fast forwarding through all the opening acts like westside connec and you dont have to watch it again for years .  .  . this is quite a different approach .   i was literally hurting from laughing so hard because this dvd gives you the bishop don juan ,  it gives you backstage ,  it gives you the norml conference .  .  . you cant even take it all in if you watched it once !   i say if you like snoop ,  if you like weed ,  if you like biatches and hiznoes ,  you got a winner with the puff puff pass
i grew up in  hannibal mo ,  so i am very familiar with mark twain's writing and his humor .   the make up is great as holbrook even looks like twain .   holbrook is a great story teller ,  and he uses the material well ,  and makes it wa wonderful program .   i saw a perfomance live in nyc years ago ,  and another one in my current home town .   each time i see it again ,  it is still funny and a great performance
this is the best batman volume yet !  the old robin  (  dick grayson  )  ,  travels around the world and becomes nightwing .  a new robin fights by batman's side  (  tim drake  )  ,  and batgirl is part of the group .  many villains look different .  clayface looks more like clay ,  and bane looks more and act more like a freelance assasin .  i will now tell you how good each episode is .disc 1 : holiday knights=asins of the father=a+cold comfort=a-double talk=a-you scratch my back=anever fear=a+disc 2 : joker's millions=b++growing pains=a++love is a croc=b+torch song=a-the ultimate thrill=b+over the edge=a++disc 3 : mean seasons=b+critters=a-cult of the cat=aanimal act=a+old wounds=a++the demon within=adisc 4 : legends of the dark knight=a-superman episode-girl's nite out=amad love=b++chemistry=abeware the creeper=a++judgement day=b+
i really did ;  i would watch it almost everyday !  it was my favorite movie back then !  i held this tradition until .  .  .   ( sob )  .  .  .  my mom threw away our copy !  i don't care if the tape was old !  i still wanna see it !   ( i'm gonna buy it on dvd soon !  ^_^ )  fluke is a great movie the whole family can enjoy .  it's an original story that should make you cry .  it even has a pretty funny ending !  i can't wait to see this movie again .  .  .  anyway ,  this movie is about a man who dies in a car-crash and gets reincarnated as a dog--i know a lot of peeps out there that don't believe in reincarnation but just remember ,  this is fiction--anyway ,  as he grows older ,  he wants to see his wife and kid even more .  he decides to find them .  he one day sees them in a parking lot  ( and can't remember what they did ,  the last time i saw this movie was a couple years ago )  and he ran up to the car window and scared his wife .  she told him to shoo and after a while he got off the car and watched them drive away  ( i think )  .  i sadly can't remember what happened after that but i know he goes to his house and his son asks if they can keep him for a pet .  the mother agrees ,  reluctantly .  i dont remember a lot of the rest but i know he meets another guy that was reincarnated as a dog and they become friends .  .  . and .  .  . uh .  .  . no !  i need to watch the movie again !  !  !  i just bought the book ,  so after i read the book ,  i plan to watch the movie .  bwa ha ha~~ !  !  !  anyway ,  it's a fun-filled movie .  watch it
this dvd was more challenging than i thought ,  but within a few short weeks i can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness .   recently someone who had not seen me in a while commented that my body looked different ,  so i guess that means the programs really work .  haha  : - )  overall i have been impressed with not only the level of difficulty but also the variety of content and workouts available .   i easily recommend this dvd
see how the creative process works when making the world's best selling album ever .  great insight on the a band coming together as one .  interviews are great
i love this video .   i get up before anyone else so that i can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long .   it's a fantastic meditation ,  though ,  that centers me for the entire day .   ravi singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear .   ana brett does the poses very clearly ,  and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses .   i have already recommended this video to friends
hard-bitten cop john kimble  ( arnold schwarzenegger )  gets more than he bargained for when he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to pursue murderous drug dealer cullen crisp  ( richard tyson )  while at the same time protecting the man's young son .  pitted against a classroom full of rowdy ,  6-year-old moppets whose monkeyshines try his patience and test his mettle ,  kimble may have finally met his match  .  .  .  in more ways than one
in all her 48 movies ,  brigitte bardot never catches public imagination with more effect than she does here .  paradise on earth is just around the corner ,  she tells us ,  making the sparks fly off your screen .  this edition is the new one ,  by the way ,  cleaned up in 2000 .  you will appreciate its fine use of colors .that really is all there is to say about this movie .  but it's enough .  more than enough .  it is exactly the reason why 'et dieu crea la femme'  ( = and god created woman )  is immortal
wow !  the plane crashes and the story goes on the starnge island .  the suriviors ,  the killers ,  and others .  .  . who is who before the crash ,  and who becomes what after the crash .lost start as simple tale of air crash but as the story goes forward we learn the back story of each survivor ,  there links with other survivors  and what the island has shown them .end of each episode leave you with a question mark ,  which gives you sleepless nights ,  and sometime destroy your attention to your fellow men .go on and get lost in one of the best t . v thrilers of our time .
ok ,  i understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo .those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters .they are the traditional  " mars "  and  " venus "  symbols representing masculinity and femininity .i also understand the last symbol representing  " infinity "  ,  a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever .  or maybe the propagation of  " eternal life "  by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity .but what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol ?  ?  ?are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values ?( the star of david representing judaism and a cross representing christianity )i haven't seen the movie in years but i don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot .please also forward your thoughts to vboston at aol . com .
okay , the only real extras on the dvd is a theatrical trailer for the film and some biographical information on the movie and it's stars , but warner bros .  gets a five star rating for great picture and sound and the option of both standard full frame and widescreen versions on one disc !  !  !  this movie is an absolute classic !  !  !  and it's great to have it on dvd !  !  !  one of the great  " men in chains "  films !  !  !  the great cast includes paul newman , george kennedy ( in his oscar winning role !  )  , wayne rogers , strother martin , joe don baker , ralph waite , and many other classic character actors !  !  !  two thumbs up !  !  !  five stars !  !  !  a

not only does the movie signs offer a wonderfully different kind of alien/ufo tale ,  but its characters are very likable and the story is about much more than aliens from another planet .  the story's true question is this :  does everything just happen by chance ,  or is god caring for his children in ways they simply cannot understand ?  signs is the story of hope lost ,  faith put aside because of intense pain and grief ,  and how one man's relationship with god affects the lives of those around him .  we were amazed by how truly moving this film is ,  as well as how humorous it can be ,  and we were impressed with the acting of all the cast .  does everything just happen by chance ,  or is god caring for his children in ways they simply cannot understand ?

i cannot recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie ,  which is my favourite from the 1980's by far .  the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in  " big business "  , that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood's golden age .  a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory .  the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in  " big business "  ,  it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york's business world .the story begins in a flash back when wealthy new yorkers hunt and binky shelton are passing through rural backwater jupitor hollow when binky goes into labour .  at the same time locals garth and iona ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of sadie and rose but are also mixed up .  we move forward forty years to where sadie shelton is the corporate head of moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of holomade ,  the local industry in jupitor hollow .  getting wind of their plans the militant jupitor hollow resident rose ratliff decides to go fight these  " pinstriped trouser snakes "  ,  on their own territory and sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring jupitor hollow .  through a mix up they end up staying in the plaza hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as  " sinks in the living room "  ,  and  " soaps in the shapes of swans "  !  complication piles on top of complication as sadie shelton's ex husband michael  ( barry primus )  ,  can't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural sadie for his hard nosed wife and jay marshall ( michael gross )  ,  can't for the life of him understand why rose  ( ratliff )  is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure rose  ( shelton )  .  all comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two sadie's are really the city sheltons while the two rose's are really the twins meant to be in jupitor hollow .  the fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when sadie  ( shelton )  ,  is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to sadie  ( ratliff )  ,  to put all her watching of her idol alexis carrington in  " dynasty "  ,  to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing jupitor hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully .classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins ,  on the classic 1960's comedy series  " the patty duke show "  .  i dont think i've ever seen bette midler in finer form than in  " big business "  .  her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails sadie shelton who's all  " hostile takeovers "  to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin sadie ratliff who only wants to be able to say  " keep the change !  "  is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter .  her classic mirror sequence with her  " twin "  ,  is a total riot and her statement that  " this whole thing has got ufo written all over it !  "  , will have you breaking up with laughter .  equally lily tomlin as both country activist rose ratcliff ,   " i'm gonna go kick some snooty new york ass !  "  ,  and as rose shelton the awkward out of place city girl  " i hate shopping and i hate new york in june !  "  , is also top rate .  her rejection of jay's engagement ring as a supposed  " bribe "  and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a  " great big belly scraping pile of cow plop !  "  ,  is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene i never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening i have of this movie .  of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at new york's plaza hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up .  two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk's  ( joe grifasi )  ,  continual mixing up of sadie shelton/ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined ,  and especially fabio alberici's  ( michele placido )  ,  total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers ,  the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone !  the hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women  ( one from the country and the other from the city )  ,  seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff .  it is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both bette midler and lily tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first .  classics like :   " im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease !  "  ,  " oh my god it's so cosmopolitan "  ,   " oh sure its full of crowds ,  smog ,  sex fiends ,  and white slavers ,  it's a pistol ,  i've got about as much use for it  ( new york )  ,  as a toad has for spit pearls !  "  ,   " computer chips ,  they've got their ways !  "  ,  and  " have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase ?  "  ,  are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script .total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more .  it is a real pity that  " big business "  ,  so far has marked the only time that bette midler and lily tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle .  this film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages .  i've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as i am !  so i'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven't already .  you wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends ,  in bette midler and lily tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in  " big business "  .  enjoy !
ella of frell  ( anne hathaway )  is an unusual child .   as a baby ,  a bumbling fairy godmother named lucinda  ( vivica a .  fox )  gave her the gift of obedience .   every time anyone gives her a direct command ,  she must obey .despite ,  or maybe because of ,  this  " gift ,  "  ella grows to be a headstrong woman .   she goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres ,  giants ,  and elves .   current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only .   but ella campaigns for their equality .she is also one of the few women in the realm who doesn't swoon at the site of prince char  ( hugh dancy )  .   when the two meet accidentally ,  char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman .trouble is brewing at home ,  however .   ella's stepsister hattie  ( lucy punch )  has figured out ella's secret .   now ,  ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do .   so she leaves home and sets out to find lucinda to give the gift back .i had missed seeing this movie in the theater ,  and finally got a chance to watch it .   i missed a real treat .   the movie is funny from start to finish ,  and i had a grin on my face the entire time .   while the story is a bit predictable ,  it isn't super preachy .   the cast does an amazing job bring their characters to life .   the only drawback to the movie is the special effects .   while some worked well ,  most of the time they weren't up to today's standards .while the main audience might be teen girls ,  this is one adult male who loved it .   it's sweet ,  charming ,  and entertaining .   what more could you want
great movie !  make it part of your collection .  good story ,  beautiful video and great sound .  turn your volume up on the blast-off and you will feel the power !
if you enjoy movies with random terrorist executions ,  religious cults ,  andy kaufman as a mass murdering cop ,  alien abductions ,  bizarre sexual anatomies ,  etc  ( don't we all ?  )  ,  you will love this one .   alone in its genre
you go ,  diva !  !  i missed these videos ,  soooo cool !  !   deeper than the night ,  i think my favorite olivia song of all-time .  .  .  so young ,  so beautiful !  !   and even hotter now .  .  .  check-out video gold 2 - just as incredible .  .  .  rock on ,  olivia !
all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie .  this is a very well made movie ,  with perfectly competent performances .  the tone is quite serious ,  and the ending won't cheer anyone up .  but then there are many people who loved titanic ,  which i found utterly depressing .  more to the point ,  though ,  who cares about the problems of these rich kids ?  not me .  the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful .  and if you enjoy this film ,  check out less than zero ,  another gloomy but solid  ( & underrated )  '80s film .  the worst '80s film is bright lights ,  big city - don't say i didn't warn you !
i fell in love with this movie me and my husband .  and that is funny because usually we don't have the same taste in movie
the answer is no deal !in ruthless people danny devito is great as sam and bette midler as  barbara is terrific buttogether they are a miserable couple .  sam ,  who has a girlfriend ,  carol ,  wants out of the marriage but ,doesn't want it to cost him anything .  when he learns that barbara has been kidnapped ,  he thinks he has it made !by not agreeing to pay the ransom amount ,  no matter how little that might be ,  he counts on the kidnappersto save him from paying alimony by bumping barbara off !the bumbling kidnappers are ken and sandy ,  adeptly played by judge reinhold and helen slater .they have a grudge against sam who stole their dress design and made a mint .they are astounded when ,  after giving sam their demands ,  he emphatically says ,  'no deal' and hangs up on them .in desperation they lower the amount .  sam still says ,  'no deal' !barbara learns sam has refused to pay the ransom not once but twice !she is furious and can't believe that she has been marked down like clothes on a sale rack !barbara and sandy create a bond when barbara ,  through a better diet and exercise ,  has lost weightand needs different size clothes and sandy provides her with clothing she has designed .barbara loves the designs and they decide to form a partnership .their first agenda being sam and the second developing a clothing line .the plot thickens when the police become involved ,  thanks to carol .  as suspicion focuses on sam ,he is forced to come up with the ransom to clear himself !fuming ,  he gets the money and drops it off counting on the police to arrest the kidnappersand retrieve his money .  the drop off does not go well .  a car chase ensues !and then what happens next is  .   .   .  hmmm   .   .   .  let's just say sam's fortune takes a dive
spider-man  ( 2002 .  )  the first spider-man film .spider-man 2  ( 2004 .  )  the second spider-man film .introduction :in 2002 ,  the first of the live-action spider-man hit theatres .  it's not likely that the film's director ,  sam raimi ,  had any idea just how successful his big-screen incarnation of the classic superhero would be .  it drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres ,  and the dvd releases did the same .  the sequel ,  appropriately enough ,  was even more hyped ,  and did even better .  and now ,  both films have been combined into a single set !  read on for my review of the spider-man films .storyline :essentially ,  this set includes both of the films .  the first of the two films explains how peter parker got bitten by a radioactive spider ,  and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into spider-man .  in the first film ,  the villain is former head of oscorp ,  norman osborn ,  who has been transformed into the green goblin by a chemical he was testing .  the second film continues two years after the first left off ,  and features spider-man facing off against doc ock ,  a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body .  this time around ,  juggling the duties of being spider-man with work and school have made peter parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle .opinions :both of these films flat-out rule .  seeing the first film turned me into a spider-man fan practically overnight .  the acting and storyline are both excellent ,  particuarly willem dafoe's portrayal of norman osborn/the green goblin .  everything the first film did well ,  the second one does even better .  i was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film ,  since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them - but sam raimi does it here .  these are great films ,  and the fact that they're together in one package only sweetens the deal .dvd :these are the standard dvd releases of the film ,  meaning each one has a bonus disc of material .  there are a ton of bonus features ,  including commentary ,  cast and crew interviews ,  and assorted other extras too .  the second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books ,  and the plotlines of them !  that's my favorite extra on either of the discs .  the other features are also excellent ,  and if you like the films ,  you'll agree they're worthwhile .overall :i can't begin to express my satisfaction with these films .  the cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece ,  and i think you'll agree superhero movies don't get any better .  being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet .  these are must-watch movies ,  regardless of who you are .  even if you're not a big fan of the spider-man franchise ,  you may be pleasantly surprised
this is a great family movie ,  a fresh take on enchantment stories .  it's rather in the style of e .  nesbit's books ,  using contemporary references .  i find it far superior to many of disney's usual works .  it's enjoyable for adults and kids
in spite of the thin plot line and the volumptous semi naked women ,  the comedian bernie mac stole this picture !   he played his part of the low life ,  club owning ,  hustler with perfect timing and high humor .   he made this movie enjoyable to watch
i never bought the vhs tape ,  but when i was notified this would be coming out on dvd ,  i ordered it .  while i'm not an amateur ,  i am a professional ,  eric is a guitarist's guitarist .  anyone who thinks he don't need learnin' is a fool and only famous in his own little world ,  small as it may be .  i'm not that arrogant .as danny gatton was known as the humbler ,  eric johnson could rightly be called the inspiration .  what he does is not so much difficult as it is the epitome of finesse and transparency of technique .  after viewing this ,  you will understand what i mean .i already know much of what eric teaches in this session ,  for that is what it is ,  a private session  ( much like you might get at git )  ,  with a master at the top of his craft .  but there is always something to learn even after repeated viewings .  i even scanned in the booklet that comes with this so i can break the lessons down and blow up the individual charts for more easy reading .if you are serious about improving as a player ,  and if you're looking to be a real professional ,  you need to get this ,  if only to see what true professionalism looks and sounds like .  the lessons are clear and focused .  and with the booklet and the new ability to slow down the examples ,  you really can learn to play these things .  but don't expect to sound like eric  ( just as those who tried to ,  but could never sound like jimi hendrix )  .you are different and so will always sound different ,  and that's a plus .  but the techniques and all that are included here are part of a  " must learn "  program you need to create and follow if you want to at least make a good living playing music .learn from a master of melody and technique ,  where technique doesn't get in the way of the melody ,  but lives in service to the song -- the way it should be .i teach ,  too .  and i recommend to any student who wants to grow that they should get this dvd .  if you get no other ,  this would serve whatever style you choose to pursue ,  ultimately ,  because there is so much here that can be applied to virtually any style ,  whether it is jazz ,  country ,  blues ,  rock or even acoustic  ( which i wish he would have included a segment on that ,  my only kvetch )
oh my god this has to be the best film i have ever seen in my life .  first things first ,  how did they train that monkey ,  he is as clever as einstein .  my pal mickso said its just a guy in a suit but that son of a gun isn't fooling me clap !  clap !  clap !  well done mr monkey !  anyways i'd highly recommend this film .  .  .  .  . and joining a stamp collecting club ,  they've both changed my life forever ,  in fact i hope to grow up to be a stamp collecting monkey actor .  .  .  .  .  .  .  with as many casio watches as i can eat .   this is kevin kennedy signing out dudes  ; o
rather than  " menace to society "  ,  this movie should be titled ,   " the unfortunate victims of a racist society "  .  my heart bleeds for the real-world counterparts of these young men ,  caught up in the unending battle for survival in south-central la ,  and other such areas all around the country .i understand that we all make choices ,  but how many do these young men have ?  it is a racist ,  exclusionary society that has condemned them to their fate ;  to die violently at the hands of their own brothers .  its sickening .  society is more of a menace to these young men ,  than they are responsible for being a menace to society .having said that ,  the movie itself is excellent .  it's gritty and real to the 'nth' degree .  movies like this should be a huge wakeup call for the 'powers that be' in this country ,  but the reality is that the grave lessons it teaches will pass unnoticed
so this is the best i have seen from a terrible tradgedy .  i watched with friends with tears streaming down my face .  so factual and so sad
cheap trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today .they have such great stage charisma ,  top notch talent ,  and they consistently get better with age !   what other band sounds better 30 years later ?after my disappointment with the special one cd ,  i was excited to hear about this dvd ;  i heard most special one songs live ,  and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly .   having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out .   and the songs do sound much better now ,  such tremendous intensity robin has live ,  the guitars and bass sound great ,  and there's a great build up to the climax of each song .however ,  what's really the downer about this dvd is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track ,  you then get 2/3 of each live song .   not a single song appears here in its entirety .   it's like a behind the music  ( without drama or drugs )  based around a new live show .   the banter is great ,  but this clip-show format kills the replay value of this disc .the closest comparison i can give is the 2-dvd version of silver ,  how the second dvd has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs .   that's exactly what this is like ,  however ,  you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show .bonus features are fun ,  with the band and their families visiting japan ,  although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety .perhaps someday we'll get the budakan show on dvd or an updated every trick in the book dvd .update 6/14/05 :   exactly a year later ,  i've still yet to pop this into my dvd player for a second watch ,  and cheap trick's still my favorite band .
a solid series until the end .  even though this season the deaths are not important it centers more on the families .   it was sad to see the serise end but it is probably the series finale ever .
in my opinion ;  there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of martin short's humor with the exception of ,   " clifford "  .  my then teen children and i spilt our sides laughing at short's work when we first saw this film !  several times we laughed so hard at a scene ;  we couldn't go on until we replayed the scene several times over .  we were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter !  all three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored .  even if you are not a big fan of martin short ;  you will enjoy ,   " clifford "
i first saw  " dragonslayer "  when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981 .   it was the first vhs movie i ever purchased .   it's very well made ,  an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about .  it still holds up .  caitlin clarke's performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job .   i wrote her when the film came out telling her as much ,  and received a hand-written thank you letter .   i learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004 .    " dragonslayer "  has action ,  humor ,  humanity ,  political irony .   and if none of those matter to you :  it's just plain fun
there simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than frank gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work .   he has both his passionate lovers and haters .   i am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle .   i really love some of his work ,  while i find some of his work to be quite off putting .   the person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of gehry's work ,  art critic claude jencks  ( the person who popularized the term  " postmodern "  )  .   jencks ,  for whose deceased wife gehry designed a memorial building ,  states bluntly that gehry has made some ugly buildings .   i think with gehry more than most architects ,  one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition .   whatever else one may say about gehry ,  he isn't like other architects .one reviewer below called this a  " puff piece ,  "  but that isn't really correct .   it is more correct to call it a conversation with a friend .   gehry asked his close friend ,  the mainstream director sydney pollack ,  to make a documentary of his work .   the result is a fine portrait of gehry's career .   pollack certainly does not criticize his work ,  but interestingly he does not over praise it either .   they do call attention to the fact that many simply don't like his work and the film contains numerous excerpts from one of gehry's more vociferous and respected critics ,  hal foster .   but the point of the film is not to provide an objective and critical overview of frank gehry's work .   the point is to get to know frank gehry and some of his ideas about architecture .   in this the film succeeds marvelously .if one watches a number of documentaries about architects ,  one thing that is striking is how many of them are enormously likable individuals .   for every irascible frank lloyd wright there are ten you'd love to sit down and have a beer with .   much like i .  m .  pei ,  frank gehry comes across as an immensely likable guy in this film .   perhaps away from his friend's camera he is an implacable tyrant ,  but those qualities ,  if they exist ,  are not apparent here .   instead ,  he comes across as a genuinely nice guy .   in fact ,  a couple of the individuals interviewed stress that as laid back as gehry is ,  he really does have an ego .   i don't think i've ever heard a person in the creative field have anyone insist that appearance aside ,  they really do have an ego .   in the vast majority of cases ,  that is all too apparent .i found it interesting to see the shots of gehry and either of his design partners working with him on designs .   if you are accustomed to think of architecture as akin to drafting ,  watching gehry work is a bit of a shock .   he doesn't design so much as sculpt .   he and his partners look like a couple of extremely mature kindergartners with scissors and paper as they cut ,  bend ,  shape ,  snip ,  and play with variations on the model they are struggling with .   there is apparently little or no concern with the particular materials to be used .   he seems rather to struggle with the kind of overall shape ,  with the assumption that with today's materials any kind of design can be turned into a reality .   the film really brings out how gehry's own conception of architecture is much closer to sculpture than to engineering .as a resident of chicago ,  a city noted for his importance to twentieth century architecture ,  it has been amazing to realize how little of his work has been done here .   in fact ,  apart from his controversial  ( what else ?  )  work in millennium park ,  i'm not aware of anything else he has done here .   as a result ,  i have less direct experience with gehry's work than many other leading architects .   i must confess that much of what i see appears to be fascinating .   i would ,  for instance ,  absolutely love to see his bilbao museum .   but there is one aspect to gehry's work that i really applaud :   its emphasis on individualism .   one criticism of much architecture has been its essential conservativism .   much of it espouses nonegalitarian and conformist values .   one sees exceptions ,  such as louis sullivan's refusal to put box seats in his chicago auditorium design .   if one looks at a gehry design ,  it is hard to imagine it ever becoming the style of choice of a repressionistic ,  totalitarian regime .   it is too individualistic ,  too anarchic for that .   even such a free spirit as louis kahn still designed the capitol of bangladesh .   but it is simply impossible to imagine frank gehry designing a capitol .i thoroughly enjoyed this movie .   i came away from it with a greater liking for frank gehry as a person than i had anticipated .   and perhaps i will in the future be more inclined to appreciate his designs .   he may not be the greatest of our architects ,  but he certainly is one of our more likable free spirits
foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world .  the inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together ,  legs ,  played phenomenally by angelina jolie .  i must say this :  i really don't care much for ms .  jolie ,  and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her & billy bob and their whole blood thing the top news story ,  more recently her husband-stealing with brad pitt ,  but i cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance .  if you are like me and don't like her ,  please do give her a chance in this film .  she's astonishingly good and i kept having to remind myself it was angelina .as a matter of fact ,  the entire cast turns in memorable performances .  i think this is a great movie for women to watch but i don't know if men will enjoy it quite as much .  i did see one male reviewer claiming he didn't find it to be just a chick flick ,  but he might be the minority .  guy or gal ,  if the story sounds intriguing to you ,  and it really is ,  then foxfire is definitely worth checking out .  i give it only 4 stars simply because the character of maddy  ( wonderfully played by hedy burress )  has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background .  left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with ,  but that's my only criticism .at this price ,  it's a fabulous addition to your collection ,  though believe it or not ,  the low price right here on amazon has been beaten by wal-mart .  .  . it's in the $5 . 50 bin .  this is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing ,  but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe .  definitely recommended
a clay aiken christmas was very good !  clay's singing was spectacular  ( as it always is )  ,  and his guests singing was wonderful !  this was a very well put together dvd ,  and it was fun and exciting to watch !
this is one of my favorite movies of all time .  i saw it when it first came out and ten years later it's still just as funny .  basic plot :  ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he's alone on new year's night .  anyone who's had a bad night/day on the job can relate to ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations .  from the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion ,  to a gangster's bratty kids ,  a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken hollywood people who want to make ted part of their hazardous  ( and very gross )  bet .  i don't want to give too much away but i will say that i will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever .  if you love a good ,  dark comedy this is the movie for you
warning !  this is not for children .  seeing death ,  real destruction ,  and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on 9/11 is not for the young .with that being said ,  this is the real deal ,  what you probably didn't see on the nightly news .  great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of new york city that fateful day .if you never want to forget what happened the day that changed america ,  you must have this dvd .
i went into this dvd with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it .   maybe  " enjoy "  isn't the right word ,  it is intense ,  it is political  ( and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics ) and it jumps around from subplot to subplot .   in fact ,  i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks .   but i found it very plausible .  and that is what a good movie should do- give a plausible thesis and play it out .   it succeeds here .   it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence .   sure ,  it makes the gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them ,  but that usually makes for a good starting point ,  since most large organizations usually succumb to fear and/or greed anyway .  i once heard a history professor say  "  it isn't about the struggle of good vs evil ,  it is always about the struggle of good vs good .  .  .  . both sides always think they are right and god is on their side "  .  .  .  .  .  watch it ,  you will come out the other side thinking .
" the dude ,  that or ,  uh ,  his dudeness ,  or ,  uh ,  duder ,  or el duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing .  "  those are the dude's immortal words he used to introduce himself to the other jeffery lebowski .  you're probably thinking  " what is he talking about ,  who is the other jeffery lebowski ?  "  ,  well i'll tell you in just a moment ,  i've just got some things to clear up first .  joel and ethan coen have made some of the most loved films of all time ,  and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making duos/team of all time .  these fellows bought you the cult favourite blood simple ,  the hillarious raising arizona ,  the decietful millers crossing ,  the crazy barton fink ,  the hudsuckers proxy ,  and the blood drenched fargo ,  and now this ,  one of the finest films they've done ,  the big lebowski .  jeff bridges is jeffery lebowski or in this case ,  the dude .  john goodman plays the vietnam veteran walter ,  steve buscemi is not in it too often ,  but he plays the loveable donnie .  let's just go through the character sketches ( only the dude's bowling pals )  .characters :the big lebowski's main character is the dude ,  he lives in la ,  he listens to creedance clearwater revival ,  his favourite drink is a white russian ,  and he loves bowling .  the film is set in ,  as we've established before ,  los angeles .  the dude is an average joe slacker who dresses in ,  as what you could say ,  'the hippie who likes to surf clothing' .  sandals ,  shorts ,  crummy old shirts ,  jersey jackets ( jackets that are jerseys )  , he never wears socks with his shoes ( even in bowling shoes )  and occasionly ,  glasses .  let's  also not forget his long hair that makes the dude's image so legandary .  the dude's bowling buddies are walter sobchak ,  and donny .  walter is a vitnam veteran and refers everything to nam' .  he mostly wears shorts ,  a shirt with a sleeveless jacket ,  hiking shoes ,  socks ( obviously )  ,  and always ,  and i mean always wears his aviator sun glasses .  he also has sort of an army man buzz cut with a beard around his mouth .  donny ,  is a great bowler ,  whenever we see him bowl ,  he gets a strike ,  except for once later on ( don't want to spoil anything )  .  that's all we bassicly know about him except that he usually ( when bowling )  wears long pants ,  a bowling shirt tucked in and a haircut where is hair isn't too long or too short .  he's a nice guy and is usually told to shut up by walter because of his late involvement in conversations with the dude and walter .the plot :the movie kicks off with a man narrating .  he has a texan accent and talks about a man named jeffery lebowski who also goes by the name 'the dude' ,  and is the supposed storyteller of the dude's story ,  but doesn't narrate until later on .  as he narrates we see the dude in a grocery store in his sandals and the previous statements i made of the clothes he wears ,  he's looking at milk and tests one of them to see if it's sour ,  he later arrives home with his purchased milk but is surprised by two thugs ,  they dunk his head in the toilet and are telling him to give them the money that bunny owes them .  they later realise that it's not the jeffery lebowski they're after ,  they've soiled the dude's rug and they eventually leave ,  but the dude wants to get to the man who they were supposed to get ,  this is the other jeffery lebowski i was talking about and is the millionaire lebowski ,  he's bassicly the title's name  " the big lebowski "  .  the dude pitches up at the millionaire's mansion and attempts to get a free carpet in exchange for what the thugs were supposed to do to the big lebowski's carpet .  he eventually get's what he wants but is then later called by jeffery lebowski to drop off money to kidnappers who kidnapped his trophy wife bunny .  to cut this short ,  the film is about the dude trying to get bunny back to jeffery lebowski ,  and how he has to deal with other problems that jeffery lebowski has ,  because people come looking after him because of the same name he shares with the millionaire lebowski .  the drop off of the kidnapping leads to all of his other problems .  walter is told about the ransom money by the dude and decides that the dude and himself should keep the money instead ,  because walter thinks that bunny kidnapped herself .  walter gives the kidnappers a bag full of dirty laundry that he had ,  so they keep the money in the car when they go bowling ,  as they come out ,  his car is gone .  so they have to get the money back without jeffery lebowski knowing .the film is hilarious ,  but that doesn't mean that it's just a normal movie ,  it's stunnig .  the dialogue is sharp and witty ,  although there's alot of swearing ,  that doesn't mean the humour is just fowl mouthed ,  it's hillarious ,  some of the lines go down in history as some of the funniest one liners ever .  the coen's writing here is as good as ever ,  with excelently written and thought out characters .  jeff bridges and john goodman are absolutely hilarious ,  they're definately the funniest characters in this movie ( jesus is also funny )  ,  and make you wish the film would never end .  the other things that are worth watching the film for are the acid trip sequences and the absolutely incredible vintage rock soundtrack .this is a comedy lover's dream come true .  if you love the coens and excellent snappy humour then this is a must have for you .  even you don't know the coens too well or even comedy ,  then here's a film too start with .  just buy this now ,  or soon ,  or whenever you have a split second of a chance to buy it .i can't tell you what the special features are on this disc ,  because i have the region 2 edition .  this one most probably has the same trailer my one has .  so if it's the same as the region 2 features ,  then it's got absolutely no good special features worth writing about
we all make mistakes in relationships ,  things we wish we could relive ,  do over .   this movie investigates the dynamics of one love relationship .   we go through two sceneros .   the first gives one the chance to live over a stituation ,  correcting all the mistakes he thinks he has made .this movie will keep you guessing .   you'll experience the true deep feelings of love one couple have for one another .   these feelings end in the ultimate sacrifice for love .   the soundtrack is excellent .   i only wish we could buy it .   hewitt really is an underrated music artist .   her vocals shine and give depth to the movie .this is a five star movie ,  more than a tv movie ,  watch it some rainy sunday afternoon ,  it will make you believe in love again .
yet another amazing film from paul verhoeven with so much depth and weight i can't even tell you .   stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do .   jeroen krabbe gives an excellent performance as does rutger hauer in the leading role .   everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films .   so many great scenes  ( i . e .  alex and eric's tango towards the end ,  &quot ; april fools day&quot ;  ,  vengeance on a bicycle ,  the beach scene and many many more .  )   see this as soon as possible .   it would make a terrific double feature with the young lions
this has to be the best of the alien films !  this film ,  although not as scary as the original  ( i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien )  ,  it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first .  also ,  this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series .  go on ,  buy the collector's edition of the first and this and enjoy
this was much ,  much better than i expected it to be .   a real tear jerker .   if i was to let myself cry ,  this movie would've been it ,  not  " the joy luck club "  .   andy garcia surely deserved an oscar nomination .   he was simply great .   i was not a big fan of his ,  but here he clearly impressed me .   of course ,  he was also terrific in  " the godfather part 3 "  .   meg ryan was effective ,  but still a little too cutsey ,  with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films .   but the two daughters were outstanding ,  especially the older one ,  played by tina majorino ,  who appears to be about 7 or 8 .   also ,  the look of the film ,  set in san francisco ,  is good ,  especially the interiors of their house .   garcia really seems to care about ryan .   this movie is about love ,  and how it doesn't always carry the day with alcoholics .   i also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things ,  they've been married and had a kid  ( you don't learn til much later that he is not the older kid's dad )  ,  and we see her drink a lot .   they don't start with how they fell in love ,  or even attempt to explain why she's an alcoholic .   smart
this presents us with a visual voyage into music that ,  in my opinion ,  excels that if the original fantasia .  not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid ,  colorful ,  and highly diverse from segment to segment ,  but the representation of the music is ,  in itself ,  sheer genius .  as i have come to expect from disney ,  at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure .  this much ,  i believe ,  is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music
*tales from the crypt theme music plays ,  as the camera shoots through a spooky haunted mansion .  the camera reaches the basement ,  out pops the crypt keeper with his menacing cackle*  " tales from the crypt "  .  this show is one of my all-time favorites .  i used to sit in front of the television with my father every saturday night when this  show came on .  the stories in this show were so amazing and so well done ,  that i couldn't help myself when i became hooked on the show ,  and i was only four-years-old when this show debuted with its first season back in 1989 .tales from the crypt takes you on a journey through six horrifying episodes ,  each one scaring you in one way or another .  this here first season only includes six episodes ,  but all six are very terrifying ,  and many ways ,  rather comical as well .#1 :  the man who was death  ( aired june 10 ,  1989 )this spook-tacular episode shows a man named niles  ( played by william saddler ,  who would then go on to take the male lead role in the first-ever tales from the crypt motion picture entitled ,  tales from the crypt presents demon knight )  ,  who has spent the last twelve years of his life shooting electricity into prisoners ,  sending out their life sentences .  but now ,  a law has been passed to ban the life sentence ,  for even executing murderers and law breakers is  " still murder within the eyes of god "  .  niles then appears in a few court cases where the defendants happen to be let off the hook ,  despite the fact they are indeed guilty .  this leaves niles to privately execute the defendants ,  where it leads niles into his own arrest ,  where is then in for a  " shocking "  surprise .#2 :  and all through the house  ( aired june 10 ,  1989 )in this chilling holiday-filled

patient as broken out of the sanitarium ,  and has already killed four women in the county .  the news has even stated that the patient has been seen wearing a santa claus suit ,  a suit he had stolen from one his victims .  the mental patient stumbles upon this woman ,  practically killing her ,  but she seems to have killed him by stabbing him in the stomach .  as she gets a hold of the police on the phone ,  she is told by the police to look around for a weapon to use ,  since she has informed the police that the patient has gotten up and entered her house ,  after she stabbed him the stomach .  she goes into the closet to get her gun ,  but the door locks .  as she pounds on the door ,  trying to get out ,  the patient climbs up to the woman's daughter's bedroom ,  with the daughter thinking that's it the real santa .  she busts through the closet and finds her daughter safe and sound ,  holding  " santa "  by the hand ,  with her mother screaming at the top of her lungs .#3 :  dig that cat .  .  . he's real gone  ( aired june 10 ,  1989 )in this brilliant episode ,  ulric  ( played by joe pantoliano )  comes across a seemingly mad scientist ,  who gives ulric an offer he can't refuse :  have the gland of a cat inserted into his brain to give him the ability to resurrected after he is killed .  the surgery goes successful ,  where ulric becomes a classic act at the county fairs .  he has been drowned ,  shot in the heart with an arrow ,  electrocuted ,  and many more .  but he just kept coming back from beyond the grave .  here is now about to pull his next death stunt :  being buried alive for twelve hours ,  and then resurrected .  but .  .  . wait a minute .  ulric has already died and been resurrected .  .  . nine times .#4 :  only sin deep  ( aired

ever bought her .  she gets her beauty back ,  which was formed in a plaster-of-paris head of her own self ,  but it ends up being smashed to pieces when one of sylvia's hooker friends bumps right into her ,  not recognizing sylvia ,  for she has become so hideous ,  like an old ,  disgusting haggard witch .#5 :  lover ,  come hack to me  ( aired june 21 ,  1989 )in this ciller ,  charles has found peggy ,  the perfect girl .  peggy has found charles ,  the perfect man .  the two have married ,  against the wishes of peggy's aunt .  on their way to their honeymoon ,  they are stranded into an old house ,  where they have to succomb into spending their wedding night in this disgusting old house .  peggy wants her wedding night to be perfect ,  so consumating their marriage on the sofa is

little girl .  charles falls asleep ,  but he wakes up to the sound of peggy entering the house with another man .  he watches his own wife screw another guy on the sofa ,  where they guy falls asleep

little girl ,  wouldn't it ?  "  she swings the axe and kills the guy she just had sex with .  charles wakes up in horror ,  for it was only a nightmare ,  but it was a nightmare about a true fact :  peggy's mother had killed her peggy's father on their wedding night ,  after they had consumated their marriage ,  where her mother and father had just conceived peggy that very night .  peggy's mother said she did it to consume the perfect love to a perfect wedding night .  but charles claims that he didn't marry peggy out of love .  he married her for her money ,  and he was going to murder peggy that very night ,  report to the police that an accident had happened ,  where he would inherit the money ,  but peggy has made a change in plans :  continuing her family tradition ,  which is :  murdering her husband to consume the perfect love on the perfect wedding night ,  after consumating their marriage ,  which led into the conception of their daughter .#6 :  collection completed  ( aired june 28 ,  1989 )in this lame episode ,  audrey lindley  ( the actress best known for her role as helen roper on three's company )  plays a lonely housewife ,  who's husband named julias has just retired .  one the first day of his retirement ,  her husband is already going crazy because of all the animals his wife has in the house .  she continues to claim that she does not want to get rid of the animals because they are her  " friends "  ,  they've kept her company all those years her husband had spent working ,  instead of paying more attention to his own wife .  days go by ,  and the house is seeing less and less of the animals .  julias then shows his wife where all the animals have gone :  in his basement .  .  . stuffed .  the last animal to be taken care of is a cat ,  but julias' wife bashes his skull in .  but the next afternoon ,  she is sitting in the living room with julias ,  talking to him as if he were still alive .  their friendly next-door neighbor drops by ,  where he discovers julias' stuffed body .this was a great season .  but stay tuned ,  boils and ghouls .  there's plenty more terrifying tales to come in the following seasons *crypt keeper's cackle
this was my first exercise ball tape i bought .   being a larger size person ,  i found that this was a help to getting started .   i can do most of the exercises right away .   i like that it has exercises with weights also .   i find this a help to getting back into shape ,  even with my bad back .
" kelly's heroes "  is an odd ,  yet quite enjoyable war movie .  this 1970's comedic ,  cinematic take on wwii ,  mixes genres such as the suicide mission/action film ,  the crime/caper film and the army comedy .  in other words ,  take a lot of  " the dirty dozen "  ,  mix a bit of  " ocean's 11 "  and add in some  " m*a*s*h "  plus  " catch-22 "  and you'll have  " kelly's heroes "  .  the film features a battered u . s .  army infantry unit ,  which has been on the front lines since landing at omaha beach .  all they have on there minds is a little r&r ,  that includes booze & broads .  that is until pvt .  kelly  ( clint eastwood )  interrogates  ( with a bottle of brandy )  a captured german intelligence officer ,  who tells him about a nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars .  kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small french bank ,  that is being vigorously guarded by three nazi 'tiger' tanks .  i know in this day and age it might sound rather odd ,  but this is one war movie ,  that is not only suspenseful ,  but is also a whole lot of fun !  is it an accurate portrayle of wwii ?  probably not .   ( i doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the  " big one "  )  this 1970 release pretty much through its' hilarious ,  sharp script  has more of a vietnam era mentality ,  which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it's attitudes about war .  unlike the john wayne style war films of the past ,  these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes ,  but they are just trying to make it through the war with their a**'s intact  ( and maby make a little profit on the side )  .  the film features a large ,  talented cast ,  some of whom ,  were already stars and others ,  who later went on to become big names in both television and film .  this includes clint eastwood ,  telly savalas ,  donald sutherland ,  don rickles ,  caroll o'connor ,  gavin macleod ,  stuart margolin ,  harry dean stanton and len lesser  ( uncle leo from tv's  " seinfeld "  )  .  how can you go wrong with a cast like that ?  if your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs  mixed in ,  then i would highly recommend kelly's heroes "
of course the movie deserves 4 stars ,  however i wish i could say the same for the dvd .  what does it take for dvd company to release each dvd enhanced for 16x9 tvs ?  nothing !recently i bought a sony bravia 32 inch display and i have a collection of over 600 dvds .  i learned now about  " enhanced for 16x9 tvs "  and how important it is ,  i did not care about it or even know about it since i own a standard tv ,  however all my dvds are region 1 and in widescreen ,  i never buy fullscreen dvds .  so i did an inventory on my collection and realized the following :out of 600+ dvds ,  42 are not enhanced for 16x9 tvs and they really look horrible when i played them on my pc .  anyway ,  according to my inventory .the following movies / company have failed to produce anamorphic or 16x9 widescreen and i hope that these company will release them in the near future so that we can enjoy them on our tvs .mgm :runaway traingraduateno way outprizzi's honorfxshallow gravethiefhouse of gamesdead man walkingmiserythe eye of the needleoverboardparamount :private parts48 hrscoming to americaprimal fearthe ghost and the darknessbreakdownuniversal :day of the jackalpsycho  ( available in the recent hitchcock's boxset as anamorphic )vertigo  ( available in the recent hitchcock's boxset as anamorphic )the gamefox :abyss  ( i was shocked to learn that my 2-disc is not anamorphic ,  nor is the latest digipack edition )raising arizonathe edgegreat expectationsrising sunthe refromancing the stonethe jewel of the nileartisan :house of the spiritsthe last seductionthe last emperorthe eagle has landedboundps :  please artisan ,  instead of releasing 'basic instinct' for the 4th time ,  which most have almost the same specifications ,  consider releasing some more interesting movies with proper attention such as those mentioned above .touchstone / walt disney :ransomwhat about bob ?ps :  it is a great news that touchstone are releasing 'enemy of the state' ,  crimson tide' and 'con air' in extended unrated editions on may 16 .  i wish though they did the same with 'ransom'warner :91/2 weekspresumed innocentnote that warner studio is releasing one of the best 2-disc special edition such as 'shawshank redemption' ,  'heat' ,  'malcolm x' ,  'dog day afternoon' ,  'all the president's men' and many many more .the reason why they don't release every dvd in widescreen enhanced for 16x9 is beyond me since soon widescreen tvs will replace standard ones .it is a relief that amazon is now stating whether the dvd is anamorphic or letterboxed .
awesome college movie .   my only regret is that i did not see this movie during my college years .   alas ,  they have the dvd now !yay !
i really enjoyed this movie .   rose mcgowan did a great job as the villianess debbie .   my favorite line from the movie  " it's a family thing .  "   the movie was ,  in my opinion ,  a black comedy .   and rose totally looked like trailer trash on her first day of school--brilliant !   you should definately watch this movie when you haven't got anything better to do
awesome movie ,  great for laughs .  and you don't have to be high to enjoy it .  this isn't ghandi or shawshank redemption .  it's not supposed to be the best movie ever made .  but it does give you the laughs ,  so just keep laughing and stop taking it too serious
i have been a casual fan of the radio version of  " prairie home companion "  for decades ,  although i seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time ,  usually only if i am driving somewhere on a saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast .  i read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it ,  and while most critics kind of liked it ,  there were a few grumbles .  however ,  i thought the film was excellent ,  and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans .  i liked all the casting ,  too .  robert altman is not a favorite director ,  but when he is good ,  he is very good ,  as in  " m*a*s*h* and  " nashville .  "  when he is bad ,  he is terrible .  but here ,  i thought he done good .  same with garrison k .  i trashed his recent novel in an amazon review ,  but i liked him in this .
what's so 'ugly' about this movie ?   because it depicts the truth ?   to all you parents out there ,  this is exactly what teenagers do on a daily basis .   i know because i was once a teenager too ,  and this movie hits the mark .   this is what happens when parent's don't have a solid relationship with their kids .   this movie is not ugly ,  its just the straight up truth which most people don't like to recognize .   it's up to us as parents to guide our children in the right direction so this type of behavior can be minimized
the great dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director ,  charlie chaplin .  the movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of world war 2 and at the rise of the nazi party .  the similarities between dictator adolf hitler and the comedic genius that is charlie chaplin is quite interesting :  both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year ,  same month ,  in the same week .  chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing hitler for this film ;  he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film .the great dictator has the ability to tug at your heart and make you laugh until you cry .  the music is gorgeous and the writing is superb .  though some scenes do drag a bit ,  most of it flows smoothly .perhaps the most famous scene in the movie is the final speech given by chaplin .  it is just him staring at the camera ,  and nothing stops him from saying what he feels .movie buffs have to see this film .  the great dictator is a beautiful presentation that showcases the cinema genius of charlie chaplin
" haunted castle "  and  " alien adventure "  are great ,  but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of  " encounter in the third dimension "  makes it better than the other two .   the film is an excellent way of showing how 3d started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in ,  other than the entire movie itself .   i do wish the mine ride was longer though  ( the one which ends with the big ,  round ,  stone ball slamming into the tunnel )  and there was more shown of the t3 experience .   sure ,  the jules verne  " journey to the center of the earth "  ride certainly makes up for it ,  but the effects in the shorter example were awesome ,  like the bats .   best of all ,  the film doesn't look all that dated cgi wise for a 1998 production .   now i've definitely got to get the sequel  " misadventures in 3d "  dvd .   noticed something stupid in the credits for  " encounter "  .   instead of saying  " cassandra peterson as elvira ,  mistress of the dark "  ,  it redundantly reads ,   " elvira as elvira ,  mistress of the dark "  .   unlike the other 3d imax films ,  this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2d wise .   of course ,  the best is 3d since that is the whole point of the story anyway .   i highly recommend this movie to all 3d collectors
the great thing about the naruto series is it has an involved ,  ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously .  the episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen .  it has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams .my small gripes are that for some reason naruto has the catch phrase of  " believe it !  "  ,  and it gets dropped into places that it doesn't make any sense ,  but it's a small problem .also the extras you get are really fun and high quality .  this is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike
the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act ,  but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders .  the answer ,  presented by material in the film ,  is an unflinching no .  there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three .the film's strengths are that it doesn't preach ,  at least not in an overly wrought narrative ,  and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims .  i can understand the pain and confusion of the victim's families .  what is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them .  the victims' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film .  at one point the mother of the byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone  " i hate them .  .  .  i hate them and the mother's that bore them .  "is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child ?  no ,  quite natural really .  but the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started .  i imagine the bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in .  .  .  i'll have to ask brad pitt what he thinks about it some time .on the issue of the prosecution .  they had next to nothing .  a very questionable confession from a terrified kid ,  jessie ,  with a 72 iq ,  hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard damien bragging about the murder but have no proof ,  a knife found behind damien's house which doesn't match the wounds on the bodies ,  and the assertion that because damien read about wicca ,  he must be a satanist .to look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film .  jessie ,  a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world .  his iq is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder .  jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low iq .  damien is the key to everything in this film though .  the defense made the key mistake of letting damien take the stand for two reasons .  the first reason is that damien appears to have add and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's .  the second reason ,  and the most important ,  is that damien is obviously extremely bright .  normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera ,  smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world .  damien scared them .all of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other ,  more sinister and shocking ,  suspects that needed to be pursued .  the war rages on for the west memphis three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it ,  and terrifying to think they didn't
right after watching this ,  my wife and i called our  ( now )  14 yo dancer in to see it .   she in turn had her dance buddies watch it the next time they were over .   the look of amazement on all of our faces as we watched some of the best there ever was worth the price of admission .   like the commercial says ;   dvd player ;  $200 ,  dvd ;  $15 ,  watching your daughter work ten times harder on her tapping-priceless
i love sub movies .   this one is one of my favorites .   good story and good action
" the bad sleep well "  is a forgotten gem from one of japan's great masters ,  akira kurosawa .  his other two shakespeare adaptations ,   " throne of blood "   ( macbeth )  and  " ran "   ( king lear )  ,  are much more famous and well-regarded ,  justifiably so if you have seen them  (  " ran "  is particular is my favorite of all kurosawa films )  .  however ,  this sharp and caustic adaptation of hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition .  it may be the most bleak subject matter that kurosawa ever tackled - the corruption in the highest levels of government in post-war japan .the film begins with a long but funny wedding sequence that illustrates kurosawa's great skill as a director .  we  ( and the camera )  are among a group of reporters discussing the numerous convenient reasons for the marriage ;  the bride is lame and the daughter of iwabuchi ,  the head of corporation ,   and the bridegroom ,  nishi ,  has aspirations to elevate his status in the business .  we see the comedy of manners play out in this sequence in increasingly humorous situations as the various parties deny these rumours and reporters comment to each other ,  culminating in the panicked looks on the faces of the corporate higher-ups as the wedding cake arrives - in the shape of their office building ,  public corp .  ,  with a red x marking a spot in one of the windows where one of their former partners commited suicide .  it's a virtuoso sequence that perfectly sets up the tone of the rest of the film .the newspapers have a field day with this ,  especially when various members of public corp .  are investigated for fraud and embezzlement ,  yet they stoically remain silent and the case goes nowhere .  then it heats up again as a few of them commit suicide ;  the rumours are that they were goaded into doing so  ( n fact ,  they were )  .  however ,  without any substance to press the matter ,  the case is dropped .  and that's when the real story begins - one of the public corp executives ,  wada ,  survives and is rescued by nishi and his shadowy accomplice ,  itakura .this is followed by a brilliant scene in which wada is taken to his own funeral and observes the farce - all the while ,  nishi plays him a tape with moriyama and shirai ,  his former partners ,  plotting his murder .  the way kurosawa stages this is masterful ;  the sublime music emanating from the funeral is contrast dramatically with the cold-blooded words of public corp ,  as wada listens on .  one of the ways wada contributes is to scare the living hell out of shirai - wada poses as a ghost of himself in order to freak out shirai  ( a pointed but clever method of tying in the ghost in hamlet )  .  as the plot progresses ,  nishi reveals his reasons for saving wada and exacting a very personal revenge on iwabuchi and his cohorts ;  the story's pace becomes more frantic and exciting .technically ,  kurosawa is at his best here .  the wedding and the funeral are both marvels and they contrast each other perfectly .  he uses a lot of intriguing mise-en-scene compostions for his interiors that serve to highlight his characters' inner thoughts but very little movement of the camera in order to manipulate his audience ;  the dark nature of the story is enough to suck you in .  one of the fascinating observations in  " the bad sleep well "  is that all of the characters are morally bankrupt and filled with secrets - even nishi ,  the protagonist .  his wife ,  the ophelia character ,  is the only one that kurosawa allows us to feel sympathy for ,  and even then in the end she is not fully spared her grief .  taken in this context ,  kurosawa's hamlet becomes a study in the morality and pragmatism of revenge but also an incisive jab at the fat cats in modern japan .if there is a flaw in the film ,  it is that the overall pacing is not always brisk enough to sustain the long running time  ( 2 1/2 hours )  .  the wedding ,  despite being absolutely essential ,  is protracted ;  the rest of the film is much quicker but still drags in parts .  also ,  kurosawa seems unsure about his ending ;  the film ends quite abruptly but appropriately in terms of his larger point about the hopelesness of fighting the rampant corruption ,  i would argue .  however ,  despite these flaws ,  overall  " the bad sleep well "  is a masterful and dark excursion into the seedy side of corporate crime ,  using shakespeare hamlet brilliantly but not completely as it's core .  toshiro mifune in particular gives one of his most unique low-key performances ;  instead of his usual fiery exterior we get a performance full of internalized anger throughout .  highly reccomended
one of the most maligned movies of 2004 is .  .  . not that bad .  in a fine example of how critics and hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it ,  oliver stone delivers an epic take on the life of alexander the great .  not up to par with the great hollywood epics ,  but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe .the incredible life of alexander the great is epic movie material if i've ever seen any .  his rise to ruler of the world by his mid twenties is chronicled here  ( with noticeable gaps in the timeline )  .  his personal life is just as fascinating as his public one .  his decidedly odd family life  ( as depicted by stone ,  anyway )  and his lovers  ( both male and female )  are just as integral to the story as his military victories .  perhaps ,  the ultimate momma's boy just wanted to be loved .alexander is a workable and sometimes fascinating historical epic .  it certainly doesn't deserve the drubbing it got in the press .  wonderful cinematography and a fascinating subject are undermined by uneven performances and some poor storytelling decisions ,  but there's a lot to like .  i'll take my history this way instead of as an over sentimentalized bit of claptrap like the patriot or pearl harbor any day .  forget the buzz and check it out .  rent it .  if ,  like me ,  you find much to enjoy there are plenty of copies on any used dvd rack .  give it a chance and make the decision for yourself .  my bet is you'll find a lot to appreciate .
wow ,  i watched this on the national geographic channel and i was so astonished at some of the details ,  that i had to buy it .  it should be a must buy for any library across this country .  i encouage every american to watch this
before we first rented one of the barbie videos for my daughter ,  i was expecting them to be trite ,  over-commercialised ,  and over-sugary .  however ,  i have been pleasantly surprised .yes ,  they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccarine count ,  but the quality of the barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented ,  including  " 12 dancing princesses ,  "  was significantly higher than i had expected .  they have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music .  on more than one occasion i have been listening to a cd of a classic such as beethoven's pastoral symphony ,  or the queen of the night's aria from mozart's magic flute ,  and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music ,  and correctly remembered which barbie film had used it .   (  " magic of pegasus "  and  " mermaidia "  respectively .  )the soundtrack to  " twelve dancing princesses "  is mostly adapted from some of mendelsohn's best work ,  including  " a midsummer night's dream "  and the scottish and italian symphonies .  it also includes a lullaby sung to the king by the 12 princesses which was based on a 16th century anthem by byrd ,  the recording of which was sung beautifully by melissa lyons and the women's occidental glee club .the story is loosely based on the children's story .   " barbie "  plays  " princess genevieve "  ,  the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed king  ( e . g .  seven young women ,  plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6 .  )  like the original ,  the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing ,  sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night .  however ,  in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the king their father ,  who loves them very much ,  but his cousin ,  duchess rowena ,  who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor .  at first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was  .  .  .as with many of the barbie films ,  comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters .  in this case princess genevieve has a pet cat ,  and the evil duchess rowena has an equally evil pet monkey ,  brutus .  the hero ,  who in this version is the royal cobbler ,  derek ,  has a pet parrot ,  who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated indian accent .   ( that's indian from the subcontinent ,  not native american .  )those people who enjoy criticising what the barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at .  if you ,  or more importantly your kids ,  are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness ,  then this film and the barbie videos generally may not be for them .  and the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility :  i'm not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality ,  but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is ,  that is a concern with this film .but on the plus side :  it is beautifully made ,  it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so .  alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring .  and best of all ,  the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it's own
i have loved this movie since i first it back in the early 1990's .  in all honesty it is pretty crudy but that's what i love about it .  the music is fantastic and the costumes are unique .  divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and ricki lake was perfect for the role .  link is pretty hunky too .  .  .  .  .
i am absolutely in love with this movie .  it's a real documentary ,  not a mocumentary ,  but it is hilarious .  the special features on the dvd aren't amazing ,  but the movie itself is absolutely wonderful
excelente concierto en el castillo slane en irlanda ,  bono se entrega a su publico ,  buen sonido ,  buenas imagenes ,  magnificos extras .  lo recomiendo dos horas de u
kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular  " bloodsport "  and like bloodsport ,  kickboxer is no doubt a  " van damme classic "  .   there are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences ,  however the acting suffers - worse than bloodsport in that department .   as for the plot - revenge - go figure .   but we don't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie .   hey ,  it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action .   fortunately ,  kickboxer delivers it well .   the movie begins with a couple of good fights right away .   about 1/2 of the movie is training sequences ,  but many are enjoyable to watch .   the final fight is between the villain ,  tong po  ( played by michel qissi )  and kurt sloane  ( van damme )  .   its a rather lenghty fight ,  about 10 minutes ,  which is nice .   above all else ,  they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on ,  and yes the result is some blood during the fighting .   kickboxer is the only martial art movie i know of that used this  " ancient thai style of fighting "   ( with the exception of kickboxer 2 and a small scene in ring of fire )  .   i really enjoyed this .   i also enjoyed michel qissi .   he had maybe one line in the movie ,  but still succeeded in making tong po a great villain ,  who also will return in the sequal .   lastly ,  we can't forget to mention the van damme dance - napoleon dynamite would be proud .   also keep an eye out for ong soon han  ( main villain in both bloodsport 2 and dragon : the bruce lee story )  ,  who has a short fight against tong po about 1/2 way through the movie
i'm not sure why sony ,  which now owns i dream of jeannie ,  decided to colorize the first season of this series .   whatever the reason ,  you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on amazon . com that the original black-and-white version of the first season is worth a lot more .   the reason for that is simple--i dream of jeannie was originally broadcast in black-and-white .   and for a television fan like myself ,  that's the only way to watch the first season .the episodes themselves are just as i remember seeing them .   since i wasn't around in 1965 ,  i'm pretty sure i've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here .   but to me ,  they're still pretty good .   the theme music ,  in my opinion ,  is every bit as good as the second theme ,  introduced when jeannie went to color in 1966 .the one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that sony stripped off the old screen gems animation from the end of every episode .   that logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s ,  and it is consistenly rated ,  along with viacom's old blue v of doom ,  as the scariest logo in the history of television .   the new sony outro doesn't pack the same punch .still ,  if you liked jeannie way back when ,  you'll love it now ,  especially since you can watch it anytime you like ,  without commercial interruption
" student of history "  is a student of christian biased history .  there are plenty of qualified scholars ,  and current book like that of theologian bart ehman for one ,  who show that early christianity was based on forged documents that claimed earlier pedigree ,  but were written by ambitious men who sought to dominate a very wide spead of ideas about who and what those events in judea were about .   ( not paliestine !  the romans named the region palestine after the war against the jews in 70ce )  .  the fact that one man  ( constantine )  sought a single authoritive finality was a political move ,  not an act or miracle of  " god .  "  authority of apostles is more christian myth and power assertion ,  not historical proof of the varacity of the bible and christian claims .  objective scholarship has shown for example that a church father  ( probably iraneus )  forged copies of josephus by adding the paragraphs that refer to jesus .  it is easy to understand when we remember that typewriters and copy machines did not exist then !  handwriting is sort of a give-away ,  especially when other earlier copies exist with no insets about jesus .  what is known about the gospel of thomas and other second century altnative christian texts is that they were warred against by the eventual winner .  it might have gone otherwise and then people like you would be claiming a completely different set of circumstances as facts .  people with no authority like iraneus wrote tracts condemning any other view than his own and those of his small cult .  he called arius of alexander for example ,  a heretic .  but he had no authority to do so .  he forged documents to prove it never realizing that in the future ,  others would also forge whatever they found expedient to make reality for believers .  paul called it  " lying to bring you the truth .  "  but a lie is a lie and historians can't make lies facts .  so the yoke of bias due to conditioned belief must be thrown off if one is to be a true historian and seeker of truth .the real  " key "  to the entire mystery - and the inspiration for all of these writers is the nagging reality of the original parchments found by the real life priest beringer saunier in 1891 in rennes-le-chateau .  i have been there several times .  the original parchments are kept in a vault in london at a loyd's bank .  the copies have been studied by many and here is the problem for the debunkers ;  when a fraud is being perpetuated ,  code puzzles are invariably simple and unsophisticated .  experts agree that the codes on the parchments are so sophisticated that they would have had to have been created by a very intelligent individual - a genuis .  everything can be argued down for lack of enough solid evidence if you wish to prefer christian myths like virgin birth ,  death and resurrection  ( actually earlier pagan myths )  ,  but the parchments remain a piece of evidence that no un objecive debunker likes to talk about .dan brown has made the subject popular again by writing a book and making a film that tantilizes the minds of many people .  he also gives the public a new level of nonsense to wade through and a rich source of psuedo history for debunkers to feast upon ,  pretending to extend their claim to truth by turning over toys in a kindergarten class .if you are going to claim to be a student of history ,  you must be objective and ready to accept what is there ,  not select what suits you .  and if you want to answer the many very quesitonable claims of chrisitanity and the claimed history of the faith ,  then you must be willing to question the premises .  once you do that ,  you will find that there is plenty to support doubt .  just knowing about the catholic destruction of previous historic and relgious records along with anyone who opposed them ,  ought to clue the thinking person that something is up with tradtional christian western history on its face .dan brown ,  and and to a greater extent ,  leigh ,  baigent and lincoln have a lot more material than that planted and represented by pierre plantard .  the discussion of the biblical evidence itself is compelling without ever having pierre plantard at all .  why is there a large tradition of all people extant at the time that simon of cyrene was crucified ,  not jesus ?   ( muslims claim this today and christian freemasons are aware of the source document- i have seen it myself )  .  and if we really want to be factual about it ,  there never was a jesus christ in judea .  paul created his church in greece and the hellenized region of asia minor .   " jesus christ "  is greek .  if there was a character that jesus was based on his name would have been josua ben joseph and his brother  " james "  would be jacob .  if you dig in you will find no basis for a person named jesus exists and the probability that the jesus christ character was only paul's creation based on another person who was crucified as a rebel by the romans and whose sect venerated his death as a memorial that became part of their sect of judiasm .one book of found in the dead sea scrolls is the book of enoch .  freemasons have owned a copy of it and it is tracable to at least 1717 when the grand lodge in london announced itself .  how does a book that only became known to the public when the closely guarded srolls were finally made public in the 1990s ,  already exist among a society of brotherhood that can be traced to the knights templar ?  this is not myth ,  but a sample of factual connections one can make if they objectively study the quesitons ,  culling out the fluff and theory from fact for 20 years as i have .i didn't just read ,  i traveled .  it takes a long time to verify or debunk a historical claim or theory .  these people who study the subject for a year and then write a book amuse me ,  but very well .  i completely enjoyed the film ,  the da vinci code ,  even though i could not read the book ,  because i knew too much of the where he got his ideas from to read it .  leigh teaging= richard leigh ,  teabing = michael baigent ,  and the gm of the priory named sauniere .  there is a code for begginers in the book ,  but i am no beginner .  still ,  i found the film enjoyable and i even thought the book is a good thing ,  because i am a bit like the leigh teabing character in the da vinci code .  i believe that a lie even to build a faith is a lie and overall ,  the worse will come from it .  histoy shows that to be true .  religions are built on lies made for the purpose of power and control over others .  what we witness now in the world is more of that with more and worse to come .  it is probably useless ,  but only when people can know the real truth and throw off the superstition and neurosis of religion ,  including and especially christianity  ( but all others as well )  will the human race have a chance to become something besides a mass of ants bent of self destruction .if there is any use for the historian ,  it must be to serve as a witness and a warning .  how long will we repeat history ?  as long as we insist on institutionalizing lies and myth .in the meantime ,  established christian indluence and owned media produce airy debates quoting the bible and it's own set of biblical facts as ultimate fact because they haven't yet gone to the bottom of the scholarly bebate - and don't want to .
i owned this movie in full screen on vhs .  the quality of the transfer of  " apollo 13 "  with the wide screen and the incredible clearity 0f hd that was never possible before ,  makes this movie a true cinematic experience .  one of tom hanks' best movies !  .since we're revewing here the hd version ,  i own a new samsung 61 "  hdtv and the toshiba hd-a1  ( $399 from amazon )  .  an incredible improvement over my 1998 60 "  standard sony tv .  if you have the right setup ,  it is the true home theater dream that we all hoped for since the dawn of home video back in the late 70's or early 80's .  be sure you use the hdmi cable or at least component connection .the audio track is also great !  with the right dolby digital/plus 5 . 1 receiver/speaker/placement .also ,  lots of extras on the ntsc us version ,  including interviews with hanks and some of the real astronauts
( just as a note ,  that's the japanese title )there's something about this movie that i've always liked .  i'm not sure what it is ,  but being a pokemon fan ,  of course i like it .  the movie have always been great ,  and this one has something that i really like about it .the movie starts out in the north pole ,  with a scientist named dr .  lund ,  his friend yuko ,  and his son ,  tory .  there is suddenly an explosion ,  and tory is trampled by a frightened pack of walrein .  and ,  as they say ,  after that ,  all heck broke looks .a meteor is the reason for the explosion ,  and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average pokemon .  deoxys ,  a rare pokemon from another planet  ( woah ,  more than one poke-planet ?  niiice .  )  the strange creature ,  carrying a rock with a gem inside ,  is suddenly attacked by the large ,  dragon-esque rayquaza ,  a frequenter of the ozone layer .  so ,  what the heck is he here for ?ah ,  so rayquaza feels threatened by deoxys ,  and so ,  both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle .   ( with some pretty cool background music ,  might i add .  )  so ,  professor lund flees with his colleages ,  and son .four years later ,  a young pokemon trainer named ash ketchum ,  along with some friends ,  enter the high tech city of la rousse ,  and as fate would have it ,  tory's hometown .  and ,  well ,  i won't spoil it from there .  the plot is good ,  and deoxys' 'destructive' intentions are less cruel than one would think .  don't worry ,  folks ,  no angsty mewtwo-copy here .also ,  rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie .  his fights against deoxys are totally awesome .  the soundtrack is also great .  i really love the music played during the opening scenes of the movie ,  and the fights between rayquaza and deoxys .  the animation is very spiffy ,  shiny bright and new  : p .i haven't had the pleasure of watching the original japanese version of the movie ,  but when i do ,  i'll tell you all about it ,  'kay ?well ,  i guess that pretty much wraps things up .  oh yes ,  tory's afraid of pokemon ,  due to the whole 'get attacked by a herd of walrein' thing .  heh .  okay then ,  sayanora ,  faithful readers !
i waited years for this movie to be released in the united states .   as far as i was concerned ,  it wasn't about the acting ,  as much as it was about the  " feeling "  the actors wanted to portray ,  in which they ,  profoundly ,  accomplished .i would recommend this movie to anyone who can reach that one step deeper into the minds of creativity and passion ,  and appreciate the struggles of rising above and beyond the pain of broken dreams
in a nutshell :  underrated - undervalued - underexposed -excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event !  it is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the box-office .harrison ford and liam neeson are ideally suited as soviet naval captains ,  and as believable as their rebuilt authentic k-19 !  kathryn bigelow who directed and produced the film did an incredible job ,  which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the dvd .bottom line :  this new kind of sub film is a part of historyif you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best .  if you enjoy thrillers ,  this film delivers enough edge-of-your-seat tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the submarine-movie and thriller-enthusiast in anyone .
i saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre .  i thought it was going to be another run of the mill comedy that just happens to take place in a greasy fast food joint .  not even close !  this movie is strange and should someday earn cult status .  besides i like watching drew barrymore
house of strangers is a cautionary film about the dangers of hatred being passed onto the next generation almost as if hatred were an old and unwelcome pair of shoes .  edward g . robinson is gino moretti ,  a self-made banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral .  in his over the top performance as an italian who might have been vito coreleone had the don chosen to go straight ,  robinson is a totally self-centered egomaniac who comes off more as a smug biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the old-world banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations .  it is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons ,  insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there .  it is only max  ( richard conte )  ,  who can see , if only belatedly ,  the vision of his father .  and even max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers .  max cannot do this alone ;  he requires the understanding first of maria  ( debra paget )  then later helen  ( susan hayward )  ,  both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within .  gino moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons ,  " who do you think i built this bank for ?  "  generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father .  the difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may ,  in similar real-life situations ,  have emerged .  what goes around truly comes around ,  and house of strangers continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche
i grew up watching this movie .  .  .  its a movie i seem to never get bored with .  paul newman is an awesome actor ,  and if you are a fan of his ,  this is a must have in your movie collection !  !  !  !
i have been an adult swim viewer since space ghost ctc's early days .  the venture brothers is probably my favorite of them all  ( the brak show was a riot also )  .  i am in my 40's and so i can relate to all the jokes on the stuff i grew up on  ( marvel ,  dc ,  johnny quest ,  scooby doo ,  etc )  .  the formula started with sgctc taking mundane kids 60's-70's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references  ( many homosexual )  ,  uber violence for violence's sake ,  profanity  ( beeped out but you know what they are saying )  ,  well you get my drift  ( think excrement jokes )  .  it's ted turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi american of good vs .  bad in cartoons ,  and screwing it all to hell .  but despite the same formula over and over  ( sgctc ,  harvey birdman aal ,  the brak show ,  robot chicken ,  aqua team hunger force ,  sealab 2021 ,  and probably some others i missed )  ,  i still watch and laugh ,  with the venture brothers being the best of them all .  one thing that i really laugh about is that the teens and gen x'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from ,  they are just laughing at the situations and don't get the parody .  i tried to tell a co-worker  ( whose 25 years old )  about a robot chicken bit about hogan's heroes and he never heard of that show !  i'm glad the venture brothers has got a strong audience ,  so thanks you young ignorant types for watching !  i'm in baby boomer delight !
i really liked this movie and think is too underrated .  it has a great story line and plot .  although katie holmes has a small part it is a good one .  i really enjoyed this one .  has quite a few twists as well
not dissin the usa tour ,  but i loved the europe tour dvd better ,  after i saw this one .  this dvd was a nice eminem introduction to seeing his concert behind the scenes for me .  i can relate to his music madness and anger issues ,  it did give me fan comfort while i did homework lessons and detroit love .  i passed it along for other college woman to view~lmaoi hope i get it back~lmaoamazon . com is so amazing ,  i can just order another one .chinastar
i really enjoy this workout ,  with the dvd i can do over the workout phase without having to rewind like with the vhs .i originally wore out about 3 of her vhs workouts from rewinding and using again .   that makes it twice as much as you would just rewinding them once
i have four boys between the ages of 11 and 2 .   i ordered seasons 1 & 2 and they love it .   every night we turn daniel boone on before bedtime and we don't have to worry about our children seeing anything other than a good wholesome show .  i hope they put out the next 4 seasons
this movie will make you laugh ,  cry ,  and think .   it's definitely a good date movie .   bring a box of kleenex though
this recommendation is for the uncut version of leon - the professional .   a well crafted ,  tightly edited ,  excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll .   an action film that can be appreciated by those who generally don't care for the genre ,  the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it .   if you're looking for something worthwhile to watch ,  check this one out
yeeouch !  think  " i spit on your grave "  with a very good art director .    " audition "  for the lolita set .   if you feel kevin bacon got off too easy in  " the woodsman ,  "  or you enjoy sitting through entire  " law and order :  svu "  marathons on tnt ,  this film has something for you .   everyone else be advised to stay far ,  far away
i really bought this dvd on a whim .   there is no question why this production won an emmy .    " one voice "  the very last song in the concert is worth the price of dvd .   seriously stunning
lemon and curtis are a great team -  " some like it hot "  and  " the great race .  "   in this movie we have great melodrama and the ageless story of boy meets girl  ( natalie wood )  and she catches him .   the star-studded cast is enhanced by the superb acting of peter falk in one of his great comic roles ,  the hapless maximillian always catching the short end of the stick by his perpetually out-of-sorts boss ,  the permanently crabby professor fate  ( lemon )  .   curtis does what he does best - looks dashing and debonoir in a role so familiar to him he could phone it in .   this dvd is a collector and one of my all-time top ten favorites
this documentary is very concise ,  and very straight forward .   it does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir .   it features interviews with some very credible sources ,  all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic .   i really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together .   this documentary makes a great point and i'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics
unfairly overlooked in the early 90's for rideing at the tale end of the last wave of 80's slasher films 'popcorn ( 1991 ) ' is a damn good little slasher flick with a somewhat dry but exceptable endind , some decent acting , a ludicrous story , some good dark atmosphere , decent kills , plenty of cheese & a pretty creepy villain .  the parody of a slasher film being set in a movie theatre is excellent & wes craven & the makers of 'scream' owe alot to this little known gem for slurping up some inspiration
i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson .   i had never really seen topher grace outside of 'that 70's show' which i never kept up with on a regular basis .   i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd .mr .  grace plays a 26 year-old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend .   he's become such a machine in a competivie world that he's loses his way in life .   i was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too .one of mentor's has told me repeatedly that the mid-twenties can be one of the roughest times in life .   so many things are going at once on so many levels .   to me ,  this movie captured that .   paul weitz did a great job writing this .   the cast was exquisite
astonishing .  you have to see it to believe .  just turn off the lights ,  seat back and have fun .  and amazon delivery is realy great
though cancelled for 2 years ,  this is the best show on tv in my opinion  ( even in reruns )
this is a wonderful movie to keep the kids  ( and quite possibly yourself )  entertained during an otherwise-hectic holiday .  i laughed ,  i cried ,   ( really ,  i did )  and i just really enjoyed it
my 3 year old son loved this movie .   he sat in front of the tv with his model blue angel and mimicked every move the planes made in the video .   it was fun to watch my son and husband watch this video together ,  they both had big smiles on their faces .   the pilots in this video send a wonderful message to young children with dreams .   my 3 year old says  " when i get big i am going to fly blue angel #5 "  .   i highly reccomend this video
welcome to the lower east side ,  where the high-rise apartments of the super-rich abut the tenements on the riverside .  here joel mccrea ,  a poor would-be architect ,  is infatuated with rich girl wendy barrie ,  while poor girl sylvia sidney pines for him ,  all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets .  into the scene strides humphrey bogart as a wanted killer ,  coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame .  intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the dead end kids  ( in what would be the first of many screen appearances )  ,  of which sidney's brother is the leader .the film is based on a play ,  and boy can you tell .  the studio set is deeply obvious as such ,  and the structure is too carefully symmetrical .  the social symbolism is subtle as a sledgehammer ,  and the script is too caught up with being worthy .  bogart's performance is a striking one ,  however ,  and his character stands out as fully realized when compared to the walking social messages incarnated by sidney and mccrea .  the dead end kids  ( also known as the east side kids ,  the bowery boys ,  and the little tough guys )  would show again the following year in angels with dirty faces ,  and viewing the two films together is instructive ,  showing ,  among other things ,  the difference between mgm's gloss  ( which sat uneasily on a gangster story )  and warner's far more convincing grit .the mono track is in good shape .  the print is in pretty good shape ,  but there's no hiding the fact that this is a film from 1937 .  the trailer is here ,  and nothing else .  the menu is basic .once celebrated with oscar nominations ,  this film now seems rather silly compared to the warner gangster films of the same period .  but it has a definite historical value ,  and certainly deserves its release
i ordered this after seeing peggy on pbs doing yoga with a 97 year old woman .   i've got some lung problems and was looking for something low impact that i could do to help build my capacity .   the dvd is great and easy to follow .   peggy breaks the session down into three parts of twenty minutes ,  so you can do an hour or less as your schedule indicates .   best of all ,  you work from a chair ,  so this is truly adaptable to any age and fitness level
falling in love 1984 is one of my favorite romantic 80s movies , i have two laserdisc copies one  [ new ]  and the other is  [  used  ]  and i have it on dvd too , you gotta give it a try you will love it too  :
a solid addition to the rockumentary genre .  this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars .looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career  ( and arguably he was solo with the police )  .  at the time of this movie ,  it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting .  the music is super ,  the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness
this 1988 gore film  ( i can't call it anything else since it's not a horror film in the classic sense )  features an ensemble of treat williams  { most notably from the &quot ; substitute&quot ;  series of movies }  and comedian joe piscopo ,  known for his years on saturday night live and stand-up comedy impersonating the likes of frank sinatra and david letterman among others .  the two play cops ,  williams is roger and joe is his partner ,  doug .  the back of the vhs gives a detailed description of the film ,  plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie .  lindsay frost plays the stereotypical &quot ; innocent&quot ;  woman caught up in everything that's going on around her .  .  . but the corpse of the situation deals with roger getting shot and coming back to life .  he must solve a case within so many hours or he'll turn into ashes .  .  . and as the hours progress ,  naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally .  darren mcgavin plays the part of an evil doctor .  vincent price plays in a scene or two ,  and he's revealed to be the mastermind behind the resurrection room at the dante lab  { he plays a guy named loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead }  .  the movie is gory and off-beat ,  and it succeeds in being a good parody of the lethal weapon 'buddy cop' films even though it probably wasn't intended to be the first time around but that's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great .  i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films .  .  . but those who like that kind of film will love this one .  it's not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can't be seen several times .  .  . like many of the texas chainsaw films are .  .  . but &quot ; dead heat&quot ;  is gory compared to other action films of this era starring charles bronson ,  clint eastwood ,  or mel gibson .  i give it 4 stars for the story ,  cast ,  and acting .  .  . minus 1 star for the gore factor
this ,  as you may have already read ,  was a very intimate little show made to promote morning view .  the live footage is as good as it gets ,  and the sound is flawless to boot .  this dvd really gives you a good idea at how amazing incubus is live .  most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers .  every song is a favorite of mine ,  and i absolutely love the way brandon mixed things up on pardon me .  plus the little comments brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch .  i still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that i never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet .  the bonus features are splendid as well .  if you watched everything this dvd has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably ,  there's that much on here .  just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs ,  brandon recording warning  ( a lot of this song is a capella )  ,  and incubus showing how funny they really are .  the original cut of the wish you were here video is also on this ,  which is pretty humerous .a few of the best songs on here are pardon me ,  the warmth ,  warning ,  new skin ,  and nice to know you .  as amazing and funny as the special features are ,  the standout is really the performance .  i can't find any words that would do this show justice .  i guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself
gilbert gottfried is a genius .   thank you for making a dvd that puts so many dirty jokes where they long--together !   of course i knew a few ,  but i learned so many more !   gilbert's delivery is priceless ,  and his impressions of comics like bill cosby and jerry seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier .if you're a fan of filthy humor ,  this dvd is a must have !   my personal favorite is about the guy who doesn't know if his wife has vd or tb .  .  .and at $13 . 99 .  .  . it's a steal .   do not miss this one
the postman always rings twice is the epitome of how sublime the film noir genre can be .   the story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome hired-hand into murdering her much older husband .   based on the novel by james m .  cain and boasting the stylish performances of lana turner and john garfield ,  this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic .   over half a century later ,  we are still singing it's praises .from lana turner's memorable entrance as cora smith  ( clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres )  ,  the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills .   the drifter frank chambers  ( garfield )  is so completely infatuated that murder can be as easy as picking up a lipstick case .   cecil kellaway ,  karl malden and hume cronyn co-star .   the new dvd from warners includes a fantastic documentary about john garfield ,  plus still-galleries and trailers .technical details :aspect ratio :  1 : 37 : 1  ( fullscreen )single-sided ,  dual-layer discsnapper caseaudio :  english  ( mono )  ,  french  ( mono )  ,  german  ( mono )  ,  spanish  ( mono )subtitles :  english ,  french ,  german ,  spanish ,  portugese ,  dutch ,  danish ,  icelandic ,  croatian ,  slovenian ,  hungarian ,  swedish ,  czech ,  greek ,  polish ,  romanian ,  arabic ,  english  ( hearing impaired )  ,  german  ( hearing impaired
ronald reagan might have gotten the nickname of the  " gipper "  from this 1940 bio-pic of legendary notre dame football coach knute rockne ,  but it was veteran character actor pat o'brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead .  james cagney had lobbied hard for the role ,  but when the actor signed a petition supporting the republican  ( and anti-catholic )  government in the spanish civil war ,  notre dame refused to okay him for the part .  this was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in south bend ,  and if you do know that the other one was  " rudy "  you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one ." knute rockne all american "  ,  which was added to the national film registry in 1997 ,  is a fairly standard bio-pic ,  evincing the almost documentary style that was standard at the time .  we see how the young rockne  ( played by johnny sheffield ,  a . k . a .  boy in the johnny weissmuller tarzan movies )  learned to love football ,  revolutionized the game with the forward pass ,  and coached his alma mater to glory with the four horsemen and george gipp .  the result is a long series of episodes from rockne's life that have varying degrees of appeal ,  such as when he picks up the idea for his backfield shift from watching chorus girls dance and experiments with the idea using his wife and their dinner guests .lots of footage of actual notre dame games are worked into the film ,  although i have no way of knowing if any of it is of the actual games being portrayed  ( i would be curious to know )  .  o'brien's performance seems a tad wooden ,  but if you have ever seen actual film clips of rockne you know he is in the ballpark .  a lot of the charm of this film comes from the ethos of the original rockne ,  an american legend who was probably the first famous victim of an airplane crash .  the result is not great ,  but certainly compelling  ( plus we all learn the correct pronunciation of his name as being ka-nute )  .reagan's supporting role is deservedly memorable .  that same year he would get to play third banana george armstrong custer to errol flynn and olivia dehavilland in  " the santa fe trail "  and would provide his best performance in  " king's row "  before military service in world war ii effectively derailed his acting momentum and ultimately set his life on a different path .final note :  while there is little doubt that rockne invented the forward pass ,  there is debate over one aspect of this film .  in his first scene as george gipp ,  reagan is sitting around doing nothing when rockne orders him to go in at halfback to play against the varsity and run the ball .  gipp asks  " how far ?  "  and proceeds to run it back all the way .  after crossing the goal line he bounces the ball off the endzone ,  instead of laying it down for the  " touchdown .  "  an argument has been made that this was the first spike in the history of football .  at least it is the first  " recorded "  spike .  did the current tradition of choreographed celebrations all stem from what ronald reagan did in this 1940 film ?  you decide if that is yet another part of the reagan legacy that is being reconsidered this week
one of the many hit tv shows inextricably linked to the 1980's is the a-team ,  an action series with plenty of bombs ,  machine guns ,  and bazookas - where miraculously no one ever seems to die !  short for  " alpha team ,  "  the a-team is a vietnam-era crack commando unit wrongfully accused of robbing the bank of hanoi .  having escaped from a maximum security prison ,  the four man team survives in the anonymity of the los angeles underground .  and with the government still hot on their trail ,  they're forced to work as soldiers of fortune ,  providing aid and assistance to the helpless victims of various injustices .  .  .the a-team is led by cigar aficionado col .  john  " hannibal "  smith  ( george peppard )  ,  a wise-cracking officer who always has a plan in the works .  hannibal is flanked by lt .  templeton  " faceman "  peck  ( dirk benedict )  ,  the consummate ladies' man ;  sgt .  bosco  " b . a .  "  baracus  ( mr .  t )  ,  a gold-drenched muscleman afraid of flying ;  and captain h . m  " howling mad "  murdock ,  a lanky mental case who nevertheless carries out his missions with flawless precision .  together ,  they travel the country in b . a . 's trademark black van ,  fighting for justice and attempting to elude the clutches of the nefarious colonel decker  ( lance legault )  who wants nothing more in life than to capture the a-team .  .  .the a-team  ( season 1 )  dvd features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere  " mexican slayride "  in which journalist amy allen sets out to prove the existence of the a-team and its various good deeds .  but when a fellow reporter is kidnapped by mexican renegades ,  amy gets a firsthand look at the a-team's handiwork when she hires them to rescue her friend .  .  .  other notable episodes from season 1 include  " holiday in the hills "  in which ,  following a plane crash ,  the a-team is forced to do battle with a group of mountain men ,  and  " one more time "  in which the u . s .  government itself hires the a-team to rescue a general and his daughter from south american guerillas .  .  .below is a list of episodes included on the a-team  ( season 1 )  dvd :episode 1  ( mexican slayride :  part 1 )episode 2  ( mexican slayride :  part 2 )episode 3  ( children of jamestown )episode 4  ( pros and cons )episode 5  ( a small and deadly war )episode 6  ( black day at bad rock )episode 7  ( the rabbit who ate las vegas )episode 8  ( the out-of-towners )episode 9  ( holiday in the hills )episode 10  ( west coast turnaround )episode 11  ( one more time )episode 12  ( till death do us part )episode 13  ( the beast from the belly of a boeing )episode 14  ( a nice place to visit )the dvd repor
this 1954 musical release is just too good/too fun to pass up .  adam  ( howard keel - oh my god ,  what a voice )  needs a wife and zeros in on milly  ( jane powell )  to drag back to his oregon territory farm and six unruly brothers .  the tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge .  milly makes believers out of them .  the brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town .  whoops ,  they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets snowed-in for winter .the songs are lovely ,  the story charming ,  but it's the dance choreography that brings me back again and again .  there are two numbers in particular which showcase the brothers' dance skills ,  and they are outstanding .  julie newmar of catwoman fame is one of the kidnapped cuties .  they stick her in the back or whisk her out completely for the more involved dance routines ,  but who cares ,  it's julie newmar
this is a sad little gem of a movie .   i really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love .  the story had as much to do with issues of identity ,  community ,  and fidelity .   in my opinion ,  there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved ,  especially when considering the quality of the performances .   the slight quiver in weisz's voice was right on target as was perez's accent .  the rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable .  considering the type of story and the setting ,  i can't help but think that a three-part mini-series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film .   i emerged from watching the movie with a feeling  that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character
this collection of the first four road pictures is well worth having .   the picture quality is excellent and all four films are loaded on one double-sided disc .   but where are the remaining three road pictures ?   this would have made the ultimate road collection .   disappointing
every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for jack &quot ; ti jean&quot ;  kerouac !  to actually see most of kerouac's fellow writer's and poet's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated &quot ; genius&quot ;  that was this brother lowellian is in itself a magnificent production !  i bought this dvd today at a mall in new hampshire and could have bought it for less on amazon . com !  just a few minutes ago i did order the dvd &quot ; jack kerouac-king of the beats&quot ;  on amazon . com and can't wait for its arrival !  if it's anything like &quot ; what happened to kerouac ? &quot ;  then it will surely be another masterful production !  after i write this review i am going to watch this dvd again and experience the same chills as i did when initially watching it for the first time !  anyone that is a true fan of kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius !  to hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of kerouac himself is truly awe-inspiring !  this production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is :  jack kerouac
while elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video ,  that is not the only good thing about this one .   it features several shorts with cartoons and different characters .   my favorite part of the video  ( and my daughter's )  is the part featuring ernie and bert .   ernie decides he is going to be a doctor ,  and needs bert's help so he can practice doing the things doctors do .   bert just wants to know if he is healthy ,  and after putting him through several tests ,  ernie says that he doesn't know if bert is healthy or not because he isn't a doctor-but he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not !   the cartoons are funny ,  and there is a never before seen elmo's world at the end all about doctors ,  too .   very cute
all time classic musical/drama/love story .no matter your economic circumstances ,  with the right help anyone can succeed .   ( just don't forget the people you left behind !
what a cast !  mark wahlberg ,  reese witherspoon ,  william l .  petersen ,  amy brenneman and alyssa milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl  ( witherspoon )  and her seemingly perfect boyfriend  ( wahlberg )  .  of course ,  the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker .  wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance .  william petersen  ( csi )  is outstanding as the witherspoon's concerned father who has way too many issues himself .  this film is a hidden gem .  buy it  .   .   .  you will not be disappointed
before i saw this sequel ,  i had heard and read that it was a terrible film .  however ,  be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original .  it's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break .  i laughed quite a few times ,  and there are a lot of fun moments .however ,  the film is a bit uneven .  the movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters ,  but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard .  john travolta reprises his role as chili palmer ,  hollywood gangster ,  who now turns his eye to the music business .  using his  " negotiation skills ,  "  he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend ,  played by uma thurman ,  and try to get his young singer  ( christina milian )  a hit record .an impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking .  the best performance is given by the rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role .  vince vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end .  surprisingly ,  uma thurman gives an average performance and i was expecting more from her .  john travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull .  christina milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer .  cedric the entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long .  andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well .  there are also a bunch of cameos including steven tyler and james wood .f .  gary gray directs and he does a poor job .  he just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess .  there was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile .  also at 118 minutes ,  the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots .  the film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't .  fortunately for the film ,  the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes .  sometimes ,  the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny .  compared to the original ,  the sequel doesn't measure up well .  however ,  be cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy .  in the end ,  be cool is worth a rental and that's it .
" hello vietnam , and greetings !  "  , says bruno kirby as lt .  steven hauk in one scene of this film .  it was this scene where he filled in for radio personality adrian cronauer ( robin williams )  who was on reportedly on special assignment .  adrian arrives in vietnam from america via aircraft .  at first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the vietnam radio airwaves .  but they discover that adrian's brand of humor is outrageous , very much like howard stern in real life .  they also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing .  hey , this was ( set in )  1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with the beatles and the rolling stones from the united kingdom .  when adrian and lt .  hauk first met , the lieutenant told adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself .  when the lieutenant first heard adrian on the air , the lieutenant was not pleased at all with adrian's stint .   " you oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music' , not wild stuff "  , lt .  hauk told adrian in a meeting .  the 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like andy williams , perry como , mantovani , jim nabors , lawrence welk , frank sinatra and percy faith .   " would bob dylan be out of line ?  "  , adrian asks lt .  hauk and the lieutenant replies ,  " way , way , way out of line !  "  .  adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in vietnam and they hoped that adrian would permanently do his morning show there .  the brass decides to suspend adrian , bringing heartbreak to fans .  when lt .  hauk did his stint , many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted adrian back on the air .  one listener said in a letter ,  " captain hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls .  "  another wrote to lt .  hauk ,  " you suck , eat a bag of s--t !  "  .  so adrian is back on the air but not for long because sgt .  dickerson ( the late j . t .  walsh )  , the top man of the brass , demanded that adrian be cancelled .  sgt .  dickerson's superior loves adrian and even demanded his reinstatement .  sgt .  dickerson is transferred to guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant's abusive attitude .  the title of this film is how adrian began his morning show .  on the very last show done by adrian's friend lt .  ed garlick ( forrest whittaker )  , ed began the show saying ,  " good morning , vietnam "  , just like adrian .  ed tells listeners about adrian's departure from vietnam .  we hear adrian saying ,  " goodbye , vietnam "  in a pre-recorded message .  adrian also left vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a vietnamese woman adrian befriended .  other funny scenes include adrian teaching the vietnamese how to use profanity , adrian doing a parody of the late richard m .  nixon on the air and adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield .  this film was a megahit for both williams and director barry levinson .  they were both at least nominated for academy awards .  levinson did win a best director oscar for his next film , rain man .  this film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like three men and a baby .  both films were made by touchstone pictures , a division of buena vista pictures .  three men and a baby was a megahit as well .  both films were still in theatres by spring 1988 .  three men and a baby inspired a sequel , why didn't gmv ?  obviously nobody had any ideas , not even mitch markowitz who composed the screenplay
i had been aware that once there was a show called  " mr .  show "  ,  starring bob and david ,  and that it had been on hbo .  but i had never been compelled to buy any of their dvds until this weekend ,  when the power of satan .  .  . um ,  compelled me to pick up the first two seasons .  all i gotta say is :  praise satan for leading me to this glory !the first season ,  comprised of four episodes ,  is fantastic ,  with flashes of brilliance on  " the gay porno video "  ,  but it's the second season that really will make you a fan .  such oddities as f . f .  woodycooks ,  only the british can fly ,  child-labor comedy writers ,  the iguana ,  and jeepers creepers :  semi-star unleash the funny like you'd never believe .mr .  show proves that there is a market for intelligent ,  hilarious sketch comedy .  .  . on cable ,  or in the case of kith and monty python ,  imported from other countries .  but mr .  show is homegrown ,  it's comedy at a breakneck speed ,  and there's never a dull moment in either season .  you'll laugh ,  you'll cry ,  you'll learn how to fight crime with a  " crime stick "  and ice cream ,  and enjoy tofu-based products while your business goes to hell .  .  . led by a red balloon ." the security guard and i shared something in common .  .  . me !
their was a whole generation of little girls teenagers and young adults sitting down in the 90's to watch 90210 and party of five . they were even on the same night at one point . it was a perfect tv night ! this show is amazing . if you havent seen it your missing out and if you have you need to own this dvd ! i'm really surpised that this dvd isnt more popular . i really think its because it hasnt been advertised . these dvds need a little advertisements just to let the fans that dont search for it know its out thier . buy it its worth every penn
this movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to .   it demonstrates how connected we all are as people ,  and how seperated we are by only one thing - our viewpoints .the acting is superb ,  and you get one cameo appearance after another ,  which is a treat .   of course ,  the soundtrack is terrific .   the ending is intense to witness ,  one situation after another coming to an unfortunate finish .
murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle .  which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a  " regular don juan "  to his neighbor winston ,  a family man .murrey gets talked into visiting 4 women whom he knew 20 years ago ,  searching for a possible son ,  whose existence is unclear ,  and who may just be a hoax .the visits are all shocking in different ways .  all women live in similar locations ,  though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth .  all encounters are odd ,  the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident .  she was number 5 in the list of  " suspects "  for the mother of the phantom son .don't watch this film if you need action or a plot .  if you are happy with smart dialogues ,  odd situations ,  great acting ,  a script worked to perfection ,  this is one for you
love this dvd so much !  the actors are super ,  and the story is hilarious !if you liked the first one ,  get this one
i loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3 .   where is it ?   i hope that it is released soon .   it seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending !   a little unfair to the consumer don't you think !   it is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is .   is that correct
what more can you ask for  ( lou monte doing luna luna luna ,  it's here )  .  pope is vincent patrick's best written work and his screenplay works with rourke and roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles .   the inside buzz is michael cimino sat in the directors chair ,  but evidence to the contrary is offered :   the film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors .   instead ,  pope is a raucous and likeable tale of nyc bottom feeders whose only place in trump tower would be behind a broom .   geraldine page gives an oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her best actress win for trip to bountiful .   she's more enjoyable here
i'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand - you receive one of the greatest mgm musicals ever conceived and it's bolstered by quite nice extras .  that much you can be assured of .i'm writing this particular review because of warner bros .  insistance on using fragile ,  cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases .the problem with these warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case ,  rendering it's capability the actually hold the disc useless .  and unlike the plastic cases ,  the warner ones cannot be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer  ( good luck with that ,  by the way )  .another problem lies with the fact that it's made out of cardboard - when you remove the anti-theft stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover .  this can occur even when you're carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off .the reason i feel the need to mention this is i own dozens of warner movies ,  and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one  ( not likely ,  greedy bros .  )to be fair ,  warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases - the top-notch film noir and gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases .  but titles like  " kiss me kate "  ,   " rebel without a cause "  ,   " broadway melody of 1940 "  ,  and even  " wizard of oz "  are still only available in these sad cardboard cases .
" the five people you meet in heaven "  is a powerful book with many mixed emotions .  this film was a constant mystery as i never knew what would happen next .  the story is all about the people who affected eddie the most in his life .  the people he meets in heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking .   some people he knew ,  and some he had never met .  this was a great idea .mitch albom kept me wanting to read as i usually am not too interested in books .  this truly is the greatest book i've ever read and therefore i would definitely recommend it to everyone .
wrath of the dragon .introduction :the dragon ball z series is one of the finest animes out there ,  as any fan of japanese animation will tell you .  the series has a  " love it or hate it "  reputation ,  but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons .  young people love the series for the fast-paced action and adventure ,  while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters ,  and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time .  it's no wonder the series is considered akira toriyama's magnum opus ,  and by far the best of the three dragon ball series .  when toei animation made dragon ball into an anime ,  they didn't copy toriyama's mangas verbatim .  they added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga ,  often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace .  toei even created movies based on the series !  there were thirteen movies ,  two television specials ,  and one ova/oav .  while not usually canon to the storyline ,  they are an undeniable part of the dragon ball z franchise that can't be ignored .overview :this is the thirteenth of the thirteen dragon ball z movies .the story :majin buu is beaten .  our heroes have won .  peace has returned .yeah ,  right .just as everyone has settled down ,  gohan and videl rescue an old suicidal man ,  and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the dragon balls .  what they don't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe .  the z fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe .  but are they strong enough ?review of story :this is one of my favorite dragon ball z movies ,  due in no small part to the unique storyline ,  and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular .  granted ,  i wish vegeta had a larger role ,  but no big complaints there .  there is no other part of the dragon ball z series that has a storyline anything like this .  the interaction between trunks and tapion is excellent as well .  and the ending ?  let's just say it stands on a plane all its own .  you won't want to miss it .official ?this is a rare example of a dragon ball z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline .  right after the defeat of buu ,  this would fit into the actual series continuity .  it didn't exist in the original manga so i consider it unofficial ,  but you be the judge .review of dvd :all of funimation's dragon ball z dvds are pretty much the same as far as content goes .  there is no bonus content ,  unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the dvd to be bonus material .  and honestly ,  i could have lived without them .  some more recent dvds have character profiles ,  though these are lacking and could have been written better .  why couldn't get get interviews with cast and crew ,  or trivia/facts ,  something like that ?  funimation has a lot of room to improve on the dvds .the dubbed version :lots of people tend to bash funimation's dub of the dragon ball z series ?  why ?  it's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid .  they can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes ,  such as full metal alchemist ,  but every time they've tried dubbing toriyama's classic ,  they butcher it to hell .  the nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series .  stick with the uncut subbed track .overall :get it .  dragon ball z movies don't get any better than this .edition notes :it was released in edited and uncut versions .  do i even have to say it ?  get uncut .  and watch the subtitled japanese version .
the film's title  " paragraph 175 "  refers to the passage in german law forbidding homosexuality .  paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871 ,  and as a result ,  homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail .  dr .  magnus hirschfeld ,  a german jewish doctor ,  and a pioneer in the study of human sexuality ,  formed the scientific-humanitarian committee with the goal of repealing paragraph 175 .  in weimar germany of the 1920s ,  an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals ,  and berlin became a  " homosexual eden .  "  but once the nazis took power ,  they enforced anti-gays laws with a vengeance .  according to historian klaus muller ,  in nazi germany 100 , 000 men were arrested for homosexuality ,  and approximately 10 , 000-15 , 000 were sent to concentration camps .  of that number ,  less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made .  the film ,  gently and non-intrusively narrated by rupert everett ,  is built around interviews with a handful of homosexuals who survived the concentration camps .once the nazis took power ,  they moved swiftly and systematically against the homosexual community .  survivors detail how they clung to vain hope--one man ,  for example believed that with known homosexual ,  ernst rohm controlling the sturmabteilung  ( sa )  other homosexuals would be safe .  another survivor noted the homosexual clubs remained open after the nazis came to power ,  and he took this as a positive sign before he realized that  " they let us keep our meeting places ,  so we could be snatched up .  "the survivors tell their painful stories .  one man looks through a photo album in which most of the photos have now been removed ;  another looks at a photo of a large family gathering and is able to pick out the faces of the two relatives who survived .  one remembers the screams of those hung from poles .  one man spent years in buchenwald--only to be snatched up and thrown in dachau .  while most of the survivors are unable or unwilling to describe their experiences in the concentration camps ,  the grief ,  the anger ,  and the outrage are just below the surface ." paragraph 175 "  is an important ,  gripping ,  powerful film--those incarcerated ,  tortured and murdered for their sexual orientation should not be forgotten .  the anti-homosexual movement began as a loss of civil rights and devolved into one of the most shameful episodes in history .  to quote one of the survivors ,   " i am ashamed for humanity " --displacedhuma
i've been a christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of rutherford's handling of the character .    i loved joan hickson's portrayal of miss marple and never thought anyone else could  " be "  miss marple for me .   therefore i expected to be disappointed with these new releases .   i am not disappointed ,  i love this new version !   after i cautiously viewed the first episode i came to fully appreciate geraldine mcewan in the role .   she is subtle ,  confident and highly adroit and i find her refreshing and wonderful .    the stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing .    some reviewers complained that the scripts don't stick to the originals ,  but this is not an issue for me here .    christie's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they aren't always done the same way .    any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times .   i think it's fun to be surprised by my old favorites !   hooray for geraldine mcewan !   i hope to see many more miss marple stories with her in the title role
get ready for this workout .  the beginner dvd's are butt kickers for a 1/2 hour workout .  the advanced dvd's are killer .  i definitely got my money's worth with this set .  there's no excuse not to be in better shape if you have this product .
" mighty quinn "  features a young sexy denzel washington  ( xavier quinn )  as a smart detective who did a stint with the fbi and returns home as police chief on a carribbean island .  there's a shadowy plot involving $10 , 000 bills ,  a guerilla movement and guns ,  but the movie focuses more on quinn's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder ,  and quinn's own discomfort from having  " made good "  but ending up caught between two worlds ,  white and black .  he's also caught between the islanders' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation .  this film is full of sexy island women ,  colorful reggae music ,  and real world dilemmas of race and identity .  no matter that we couldn't quite figure out if the plot hung together .  a winner
although subtitled grazia's island  ( grazia is the lead role ,  magnificently realized by valeria golino )  ,   " respiro "  could have well been called  " scenes from rural sicilian life "  ,  as the scenography ,  cinematography and tableaux-like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line .  respiro's locale is lampedusa ,  a tiny island far off the west coast of sicily .  about the same latitude as malta ,  this place is about as remote as it gets - tunisia is closer than palermo .  it can be safe to say that italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades ;  this is italy of de sica and mascagni ,  not fellini and prada .  the men go out to sea ,  the children play ,  women pack fish ,  old black-clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky .throughout this film you would probably ask yourself ,   " is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited ?  "  it's a fairly typical story ,  the type that a few great  ( and many ,  many average )  italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations - life in the sun drenched rural ,  ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds .  how long since  " cinema paradiso ?  "what i like most about the movie ,  besides the appealing scenery ,  was the interrelations of the characters ,  the humor ,  petty gossips ,  the impromptu emotional outbursts ,  the displays of maternal and filial affection .  the two boys are tremendous :  the older pasquale  ( francesco casisa )  is the more mature of the two .  the younger filippo  ( filippo pucillo )  has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings ,  often without sense .  his rant against the busybody women is a treasure ,  as is his little-brother-as-big-brother protectiveness of his sister from the policeman-friend .  the boy embodies an epic italianate inflammability far beyond his years .  while viewing this i thought the son's affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times .  they do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village .after seeing this film ,  i have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar ,  the differences are in the languages ,  but the feelings are same .   i enjoyed this film so much i might see it a couple of times .
kids will be kids !  within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive ,  honorable and brave .  these raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of  " love .  "  risk becomes only the next step .  susan sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength ,  courage ,  wit and willingness to go up against the big ,  tough bad guys with all the money and power .  tommy lee jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power  " fools .
one of the best films i have seen :  captures the lack of humanity and humanity of this world simaltaneously .  humanises conflict .  has the ability to make you laugh and cry .  draws attention to the plight of children and humanises the children of the middle east .  i would recommend this film to everyone with a conscience as essential viewing .  having said that ,  it did plunge me into depression so perhaps i should urge caution
after the worst  " friday "  movie of all time ( and thats saying a lot )  the series bounces back  ( nine years later )  with this fun and nice change of pace for the series is just what the doctor ordered . having been caught and chained by the goverment ,  jason escapes killls everyone but one fine looking doctor who  " buck rogers "  like freezes jason and her self in the underground lab they are at .flash foward to 2455 and earth , now unliveable ,  is visited by a group of students who free jason and the doctor from the lab .  before you can say  " ceh ceh ceh "  (  the best way i can spell the theme song )  jason is loose on the starship and cutting apart the crew .like i said the novel setting and the use of some great f/x make this one of the best of the series
its been a long time since i have laughed this much !  !  !  !  getting down to  " the nitty gritty "  it is an enjoyable comedy .   the chemistry between jack black  " nacho "  and hector jimenez  " esqueleto "  is what makes the movie so funny .  his accent was not mexican but very funny .  my family and i just loved the movie ,  which i think we have seen 5 times in the theatre
of course i enjoy this movie ,  i ordered it after so many years of searching for it .  .  .  i love salsa music and the dancing .  .
the danny boyle directed  " trainspotting "  was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of scottish heroin addicted losers .   while the film garnered accolades ,  i found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted .   ewan mcgregor playing mark renton and his crew which included  " full monty "  star robert carlyle ,  as violent psycho begbie ,  swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high .congregating in a filthy ,  deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high .   as a group they're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix .mcgregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies .   remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories .   in a humorous scene ,  cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories .   he then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them .mcgregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations ,  escaping to london and working as a realtor .   his buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life .mcgregor and carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true ,  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . the big drug deal .   they manage to complete the deal for 16 , 000 pounds which mcgregor decides to steal .   he intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew .   fat chance
this movie is one of the best movies to ever grace theatres !  i think everybody is wrong when they say that the additional footage is not worthy and should be in the special featres menu because one of my favorite parts  ,  which is when vivian tells edward that she wants to stop into the club to see her best friend/roommate and runs into her pimp boyfriend carlos .  the extras are fabulous and couldn't be better .  so pick up a copy of this movie toda
excellent .  delivered in a very timely manor .  new condition .  i could not have been more pleased
i have been a fan of csi since the first season has come out .  i am an avid collector of dvds and i'm way behind ,  i'm on another show right now as we speak .  anyway ,  i love the sound ,  and the special features are always low ,  but i don't mind that .  there is just one thing that i did not like .  part of the cover case on my season four dvd ,  came off .  it still fits into my dvd collection ,  and i obviously won't buy another copy because the dvd's are working fine ,  but the plastic may come into a problem
this is a classic musical that i grew up watching on network tv .  it has the great love story for the girls and the cool gaget car for the boys .  i bought it to share with my kids and they loved it
for those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired ,  all i can say is that you won't be disappointed .   this series is one of my all time favorite tv shows .   when i discovered it was on dvd i snapped it up right away .   the picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version i originally saw .   this is the first tv series i have ordered on dvd and i was afraid the picture quality would be vhs .   boy was i wrong ,  this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd i have ever purchased .   if you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series
i bought this season of survivor  ( i never saw this season )  but it was very ,  very good .  i'm glad that jon lost and sandra won !  i was shocked when they let outcasts back into the game .  i'm glad that lill came back .  but i was mad that burton came back !  4 stars
if you loved this movie ,  try 50 first dates .   the surprising chemisty from drew and adam continues in that movie .   i love the humor and the 80s clothes !  !   : -
i enjoyed ice age ,  and this movie is good as well .  thankfully ,  all of the cast from the original ice age returned ,  and the comedy as well .  and ,  besides the characters ,  the story is another original idea ,  and a great stand alone movie by itself ,  and thankfully not a rehasing of an old one .   the ice age is coming to an end ,  and our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for higher ground before their valley gets flooded .  manny ,  along the way ,  begins to question his own mortality and the fact that he is  " the last mammoth "  .  .  . or is he .  well ,  that what everybody thinks ,  until they run across a family of opossums .   don't see how opossums and mammoths tie together ,  just watch the movie .  queen latifah was a good addition to the cast .  great film ,  one for the collection
if playwright tennessee williams's southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller ,  they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters .  this is clearly evidenced in this six-film ,  eight-disc collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of hollywood in the 1950's and early 1960's ,  all directed by true filmmaking masters .  probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now ,  the best of the set are elia kazan's  " a streetcar named desire "  and john huston's  " the night of the iguana "  .  the others are kazan's  " baby doll "  ,  richard brooks'  " cat on a hot tin roof "  ,  jose quintero's  " the roman spring of mrs .  stone "  and brooks'  " sweet bird of youth "  .a feral ,  smoldering marlon brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish stanley kowalski in 1951's  " a streetcar named desire "  ,  and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen .  intriguingly ,  one of the extras included in the two-disc set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of brando when he was 23 ,  and his stardom seems assured even then .  the plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between kowalski and his visiting sister-in-law ,  blanche dubois ,  a fading southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown .  having proven her ability to be a convincing southerner in  " gone with the wind "  ,  vivien leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability .strong supporting work comes from kim hunter as blanche's naive sister stella and karl malden as blanche's seemingly respectful suitor mitch .  now over ninety ,  malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track ,  and film historians rudy behlmer and jeff young provide more objective commentary on another track .  film critic richard schickel's 1995 feature-length look at kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk ,  and there is also a more interesting five-part documentary on the film and original broadway show ,  the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the dvd version of the film .1964's  " the night of the iguana "  deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people ,  but this time the setting is a dilapidated mexican beach resort where reverend shannon ,  newly defrocked ,  has taken a group of spinsters from a women's college .  huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations ,  and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations ,  striking visuals and dark humor .  richard burton is in peak form as shannon ,  and there is also sterling work from deborah kerr as the spinsterish hannah and especially ava gardner as the slatternly resort owner ,  maxine faulk .  the dvd contains a recent making-of featurette and a vintage video ,  both fascinating ." baby doll "  is an entertaining hoot that doesn't seem as sensationalistic as i'm sure it was when the film was first released in 1956 .  it's simply a southern-fried farce about the potential deflowering of a nineteen-year old child bride with a nice ,  pouty turn by carroll baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by karl malden as her randy husband ,  cotton mill owner archie .  1958's  " cat on a hot tin roof "  is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of brick as an asexual protagonist ,  this in spite of stellar performances from elizabeth taylor ,  paul newman and burl ives .newman is even better as gigolo chance wayne in 1963's  " sweet bird of youth "  ,  and he is matched all the way by geraldine page's all-cylinders-on performance as faded movie queen alexandra del lago  ( a role that would have ironically been ideal for ava gardner )  .  the weakest film of the set is 1961's  " the roman spring of mrs .  stone "  about an aging american actress living in rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo .  a decade after  " streetcar "  ,  the glamorous-looking leigh excels in the title role ,  while a young warren beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo paolo even though his faux-italian accent is a little too emphatic .  all four of these movies come with making-of featurettes and original trailers ,  and  " cat "  also includes commentary from williams' biographer donald spoto .the focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary ,   " tennessee williams' south "  ,  which highlights insightful interviews with williams in the new orleans area .  the film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary .  you can have the privilege of seeing broadway's original blanche dubois ,  jessica tandy ,  and compare her work to leigh's ,  as well as an impressive turn by maureen stapleton as amanda wingfield in  " the glass menagerie "  .  this is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of mid-20th century american cinema
excellent pay per view .  one of the best of 2002 .  here's the matches :1 )  6-man elimination table match :  3 minute warning & rico vs .  jeff hardy & bubba ray and spike dudley  ( 5/5 )great opener .  lots of high spots included .  for 300+ pounders ,  3 minute warning really can move .  surprise ending .2 )  cruiserweight championship :  jamie noble  ( champion )  vs .  billy kidman  ( 5/5 )both looked impressive during the match putting on a superb bout .  watch for noble's sick ddt and kidman aerial moveset .3 )  hardcore match for women's championship :  trish stratus  ( champion )  vs .  victoria  ( 4/5 )a solid women's division match .  tons of weapons but a weak finish .  victoria supposedly injured her acl in this match but i couldn't find the spot .  maybe you can .4 )  wwe championship :  brock lesnar  ( champion )  vs .  big show  ( 2/5 )of course brock was able to suplex the big show and brock was able to get him up for the f-5 ,  which paul heyman doubted .  the match unfolded quickly and equipped a strong end .5 )  wwe tag team championship elimination match :  edge & rey mysterio  ( champions )  vs .  kurt angle & chris benoit vs .  los guerreros  ( 3/5 )using a tag title bout as a warm-down match didn't pay out well .  rey possessed an intense aereal arsenal compared to his present one .  worth watching .6 )  world championship elimination chamber match :  triple h  ( champion )  vs .  kane vs .  chris jericho vs .  rob van dam vs .  booker t vs .  shawn michaels  ( 4/5 )i was hoping someone would bring the match atop the chamber ,  but was disappointed .  and the fact that jericho was a world tag team champion at the time puzzled me ,  since christian ,  his partner ,  wasn't even on the show .  besides that ,  a great main event .  rvd nearly crushed triple h's throat at one point .  jericho knew how to work an elimination chamber at perfectly .overall 4/5 for survivor series 2002 .  worth buying
peter sellers as well as peter o'toole and all the beautiful women :  capucine ,  romy schneider ,  etc ,  make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60's .  was really that world that mad ?  of course !  you couldn't stand life without a psychonalist .  thus ,  the film reflects precisey that .  the lack of self-confidence ,  the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade ,  till -happy ending ,  of course- o'toole and schneider get married and lived happily everafter .  and everybody has surpassed their personal crises .  good for the movie .  the humour is just wonderful .  i recommend it most enthusiasticall
an amazing film !  not only is it a fantastic adventure ,  but the story is well laid out .  just the right amount of special effects ,  great music and good actors .  when seeing this movie at the theater i was not too excited ,  but when watching it a couple more times realized how awesome it really is .  not nearly as gory as gladiator ,  but is similar in style .   5 out of 5
this is a warm-hearted ,  sweet story based on the cinderella fairy tale .  only we have sam ,  a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake .  sam carries on a secret email/chat romance with the most popular boy in her high school ,  but she doesn't know the identity of her prince charming .jennifer coolidge was a scream as the botoxed ,  cosmetically enhanced ,  tackily dressed wicked stepmother .  she was hilarious in  " legally blonde "  ,  but really goes all out for this role .  quite a scene stealer was madeline zima as one of the two wicked stepsisters .  hilary duff is her usual adorable ,  perky blonde self and is a delight to watch .one of the funniest moments for me was at the diner that was redecorated into a pepto-bismol fifties motif by the stepmother .  the poor waitresses were all required to wear pink cashmere sweaters ,  pearls ,  a poodle skirt with petticoats and roller skates .  if that isn't hard enough ,  the waitresses had to spin as they served people or picked up orders .  i love when funny bits like this are slipped into movies .  one can just see jennifer coolidge's wicked stepmother character instructing these poor waitresses on how to twirl as they served customers .this is a great family film .  although i don't have children yet ,  i enjoy this film as a break from all the intense films aimed at adults .  it is light-hearted fluff ,  but very enjoyable ,  like a cup of hot chocolate .  included on the dvd is hallie's and hilary's music video of  " our lips are sealed "  and a bunch of other special features as well .
i thought beavis and butthead changed america .  their stupidity was a influence of a generation .  i ,  sadly ,  was not allowed to watch the show when it was on tv  ( i was a child and in my elementary school years at the time )  ,  and because i actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode  ( just like the duo themselves ,  they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and i don't care for music videos )  ,  i really love the show .  however ,  like other people who also liked the show ,  i have to agree with them to release all of the episodes  ( for goodness sake !  i can't believe they didn't put in the customers suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one i have ever seen when the show was on tv )  because we want to see and have all of the episodes ,  not just 80% of them and never get to see the other ones .  i guess this is still recommended but remember ,  we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back  ( even if they have a lost episodes collection i don't care ,  the people want them and mike judge is refusing to give us them !
two years later ,  the red sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in september thinking it never happened .   it was a utopian dream ,  the comfort of the drugged and sleeping .but it *did* happen .  it's here on film .   they couldn't have made this all up and - besides - i remember it .  like it was yesterday .the producers of this dvd didn't have much of a world series series to work with .  the sox swept the cardinals in four .the real drama was the american league championship series .still ,  the producers have done a remarkable job of building the context of the curse of the bambino ,  the tragedy snatched from the jaws of triumph in years that are branded into the thighs and brains of red sox fans - 1967 ,  1975 ,  1986 - the new spring hopes that make one feel a little foolish .  the mind games .  the despair .  the self-loathing .it all ended in 2004 .it's right here on film .the names now fit comfortably beside those of yaz and the rest of fenway's venerable ghosts :  schilling ,  damon  ( still beloved in pinstripes )  ,  pedro ,  millar ,  derek lowe ,  trot ,  big papi ,  manny being manny ,  'skip' francona ,  the undyingly heroic field captain 'tek' varitek ,  the man paid to steal one base  ( dave roberts )  .  the gutsy trade of nomar .then there were the demons of this passion play :  all the yankees ,  but particularly a-rod ,  who played the part of a bizarrely emasculated lucifer .  and all the yankees ,  again .  and again .everybody else was just there that season for bit parts and background noise for big papi's walkoff homers and curt schillings epochal bloody sock ,  the crux of red sox nation's unlikely redemption .a red sox fan watching this dvd for the fifth time can still not suppress the goosebumps .where were we for this game ?  and that game ?  the true fans among us are slightly embarrassed about the fact that we remember where ,  a stroke of intellectual capacity that is supposed to be reserved for truly international events .as i write this in mid-october ,  2006 ,  the sox are at home and detroit is facing off with oakland for the american league championship .it doesn't matter .   we won .  it's right there on the dvd .   plus ,  the soundtrack is brilliant .it all ends in glory after all ,  not ashes .   redemption
as you can tell from my other reviews ,  i own a lot of kathy smith dvd's .  the reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great cue-ing and instruction .  she always cues from your point of view ,  when she says left it's your left ,  which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen .this step workout has 3 segments ,  designed for beginner ,  intermediate and advanced .  the beginner should stop after segment 1 and go to the cooldown .  the intermediate stepper should finish segments 1 and 2 and then proceed to the cooldown .  the advanced stepper can do all 3 segments before cooling down .each segment gives you two options :  high impact  ( power moves )  or low impact .  higher impact consists of modifying low impact moves to contain more jumps .  one person in each segment does the low impact moves so you can follow her .segment 1 :  12 minutes long .  easy to follow basic stepping .  kathy and company use a springboard step but any step  ( or even no step for beginners )  will work just fine .segment 2 :  13 minutes long .  slightly more intense than segment 1 and more add on sequences .  after you've been stepping 6 minutes kathy moves to squats and lunges which gives you a rest and lets your heartrate lower .  this is my only complaint about this video ,  i wish she would have added this at the end of the entire video and continued cardio through the entire 2nd segement .  however ,  this segment only lasts ~4 minutes so it's not that big of a deal .  there is a heart rate check after this segment .segment 3 :  12 minutes .  the step is switched to the other position for a bit more variety .  a few squats and leg lifts in sequence finish out this segment .there is a 5 minute cooldown and a little bit of a stretch  ( probably won't be adequate for most people after this workout )  .she has a safety demonstration after the cooldown where she promotes the step she shows in the video ,  but should be viewed by first time steppers to make sure they do it properly .
as a moderate skiier ,  and a filmmaker myself ,  this hits it home for me .   warren miller films are always shown locally ,  and there's hardly anything imaginable that could make me miss his new movie every year .not being a heavy metal fan ,  historically the music tends to be distracting ,  alas this  ( past )  year's edition  " storm "  had just the right amount of pizazz and flare to make it my favorite yet .   there are moments nearly every year that i take home with me ,  but storm was filled with the most amazing skiing ,  some of the most unique locations ,  and might add the most exhilarating editing i've seen in quite a while !   kudos to you folks !if you can appreciate the splendor of mountain island skiing that harldy anyone on earth has even seen ,  let alone skiied ,  then this dvd will certainly expediate your plans for skiing this coming season .   you might not go to south georgia island ,  but there's plenty of skiing nearby .  .  . just roadtrip and split a cabin  :
watching  " once and again "  is one of the most painful television shows to watch ,  let along watch again .   this is not because it is a bad television show ,  but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date .   i would like to be able to identify with rick ,  but my personal situation is more like that of jake ,  and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults i keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them .   watching  " once and again :  the complete second season "  on dvd ,  the character i found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on abc was that of zoe manning .   there is a moment when she reads her parents ,  lily and jake ,  the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister grace ,  but also ending up with less years where the family  (  " scribbling rivalry "  )  .   anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again .   if you have been spared that particular experience ,  then i really do not know why you would want what these people go through .if the first season of  " once and again "  is about lily manning and rick sammler falling in love ,  then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance .   there is actually more abut lily and her new job  ( e . g .  ,   " scribbling rivalry "  )  and rick working on a mega-project for miles drentell  (  " edifice wrecked "  )  ,  than there is about them being with each other .   while lily and rick are happy ,  for the most part ,  everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees ,  and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again  ( e . g ,   " feast or famine "  )  .   the major irony is that the dyad i am most interested in is karen and jessie ,  especially knowing what is going to happen to karen in the third season and what evan rachel wood has done since this show ended  ( although i am equally impressed by julie whalen as a young actress as well )  .   so i tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing ,  albeit for different reasons ,  but with more of an appreciation of how jessie is her mother's daughter ,  which is not always a good thing  (  " best of enemies "  )  ,  especially since jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating  (  " food for thought "  )  .having miles drentel is a mixed blessing ,  because while watching david clennon is always a pleasure ,  when he becomes a wedge between rick and david it is like watching michael and elliot on  " thirtysomething "  all over again .   but it does inspire a true moment of vision for rick  (  " ozymandias 2 . 0 "  )  ,  and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having miles around is to bring rick down to the point that all he can offer lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot .   this becomes important because it means rick and lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe ,  let alone live .   but dramatically the whole bit of karen and her law firm trying to stop miles ,  and rick ,  from building their project is more interesting  (  " edifice wrecked "  )  ,  especially when it seems rick might end up going to prison  (  " won't someone please help george bailey tonight "  )  .   when the psychiatrist that jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as rick and karen get at each other ,  it seems so obvious .this really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters .   jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun  (  " the other end of the telescope "  )  ,  but bails on tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby  (  " forgive us out trespasses "  )  .   judy comes up with the great idea of  " booklovers ,  "  despite lily's negativity ,  but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out will gluck .   eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music  (  " i can't stand up for falling down "  )  ,  but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue .   note :  why rick and karen wasted time letting eli apply to the university of illinois at champaign-urbana is beyond me ,  because i have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this december .   i have to tell you that unless eli is going on a basketball scholarship ,  he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation .    so ,  my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into eli's parents ,  or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation .my only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that lily is really way too judgmental .   at least when she does not immediately accept rick's proposal  ( another painfully true moment for me )  ,  she does not leave him hanging for long and i liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring .   the fact that season two ends with the wedding  (  " the second time around "  )  might seem like the end of the story ,  but only if you make the mistake of thinking  " once and again "  was simply about lily getting remarried .   it really is about trying to make two families one ,  which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final  ( and incomplete )  season to come out on dvd
ok .  .  .  this series isn't exactly like the final fantasy games ,  but the elements are there .  for instance ,  you have chocobo's ,  you have cactuar's ,  you have the summoning of guardian forces  ( which by the way look really cool )  ,  you have character's which have too much power for their own good ,  and a journey .  this journey is that of ai and yu's search for their parents ,  where they are accompanied by lisa pacifist ,  a woman who possesses the cool power of kigen arts .  during their journey ,  they see and do many wonderous things in wonderland  ( i wont say anymore ,  i dont want to spoil too much of the plot )  .i have this product rated as 4/5 stars ,  but actually i think there it should be 4 . 5/5 stars .  i really enjoyed this series ,  but i dock it  . 5 points because the time length adv gives the series to be is inadequate .  they say it is total 625 minutes ,  where actually each episode is 22min 45 sec ,  thus 22 . 75 min * 25 = 568 . 75 minutes long total length of series .anywho ,  if you like final fantasy ,  i suggest watch this series
this is probably one of the funniest movies i've ever seen .   those who don't think it's funny are those who are easily offended .   if you are easily offended or politically correct you probably won't enjoy this film .having said that ,  if you like vampires you won't necessarily dislike this film .   i completely disagree with the reviewer who said  " if you like vampires ,  you will not like this movie .  "  that's crap .   i love vampires/vampire movies and i loved this movie .   believe it or not ,  not all vampire fans are two-dimensional ,  some of us are actually well rounded .the person who compared it to polanski's  " repulsion "  needs to get away from the bong .   while both deal with mental insanity ,  the same can be said about a lot of films .    " repulsion "  was just disturbing and weird ,  and not overly entertaining .    ( polanski's work is highly overrated and pretentious .   we watch films to be entertained ,  not to have whatever it is polanski tries to pull .  )having said all this ,  this is definitely not a film for everyone .   it was way ahead of it's time when it was made .   had it been made now ,  there would likely be a huge cult following behind it .  .  . but then again ,  maybe not .   as liberal as most like to imagine themselves ,  we still live in a country of highly uptight people ,  easily offended ,  and unable to laugh at the things we fear or find disturbing .if you've got a sick sense of humor ,  add this to your video library ,  because if you aren't going to be able to laugh at it ,  you aren't going to enjoy it .
peter palmer and leslie parrish are excellent in this fun ,  politically skewering musical comedy .  the songs are upbeat fun ,  especially  " put em back "  sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates
good introduction to qigong .   mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful .   overall relaxing and precise .
had just enough tasteful sex to satisfy and oh yes ,  the movie was good too  :
she just keeps getting better and better .   i love this woman ,  she makes us all look at ourselves and laugh over situations that are hurtful .   i personally will keep an open mind and try to copy some of her down to earth common sense a lot uf us have let go of for whatever reason .   way to go girl .  .
in the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from andy griffith in 1957's  " a face in the crowd "  ,  master director elia kazan gets similarly stellar results from natalie wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920's kansas .  in the same year as her maria in  " west side story "  ,  she has never been more affecting then she is here as deanie loomis ,  the local butcher's daughter deeply in love with bud stamper ,  the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero .  they are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry ,  but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents .the ruling moral code restricts deanie more than bud who ends up cavorting with a good-time girl named juanita .  the indiscretion overwhelms deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state .  a few years later with their lives on divergent paths ,  they meet again to come to terms with each other .  while the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to kazan's sure hand and william inge's screenplay  ( his first directly for the screen )  ,  it's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue .  otherwise ,  there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955's  " picnic "  based on inge's successful broadway play .at her most beautiful ,  wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned .  as the none-too-bright bud ,  warren beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes deanie's powerful fixation completely understandable .  there are several standout performances among the supporting cast with audrey christie pitch-perfect as deanie's unsympathetic mother ,  pat hingle in blowhard mode as bud's power-hungry father ,  and zohra lampert as angie ,  the self-effacing waitress bud meets at yale .  the classic wordsworth poem from which the film's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie ,  and i still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time i see this movie .  the 2001 dvd unfortunately has no extras
it does tend to lurch ,  but i give it a yes anyway because it says not so well something it is still arch heresy even to suggest ;  the end is not near ,  it is very ,  very near .   and possibly ,  it has already come and gone

ohhhh !  i caught this movie on regular tv and even with commercials it was good .   i bought it so i would get the whole movie .   i have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family .   a really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you !
very good acting and a fantastic script put this movie at the top of the list of must see movies of this decade .you have to decide for yourself about the spiritual quality and message but i personally thought it was well done .joaquin phoenix puts in his usual top notch performance
this is a work of genius .  it is creative ,  original ,  funny and well done .  that being said ,  it is probably not for everyone .this wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from shakespeare's hamlet .  these are the stars of the show .  in hamlet ,  they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with hamlet's melancholia .  they appear briefly and are gone .  the last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead .  they are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince .in this work ,  the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them .  the spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them .  as they discuss existential questions ,  the tragedy of hamlet plays out around them .  it is quite funny but some background helps .it helps a great deal if you are comfortable with elizabethan speech .  whole pieces are lifted from shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style .it helps if you are familiar with hamlet .  that makes understanding the context easier .it is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics .  rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn .it's is fun .
i am a huge anime fan ,  and this is by far the best .   lemme just say ,  god i can't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is .   it inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy .   the whole series is actually based on a true story in japan .   a few hundred years ago ,  the entire population of wolves in japan became extinct .   there are people there ,  even today that report wolf sightings occasionally  :  )if you're a fan of wolves ,  or looking for something a little different ,  check this dvd out !the musics great ,  the drawing is perfect -- not just a random bunch of stills like most animes ,  but actual movement !   you get 4 episodes per dvd ,  each is a little over 20 minutes long .   this dvd includes :19 .  a dream of an oasis -- this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep .   kiba finds a place where he is truly happy ,  and wonders if he has finally found paradise .20 .  consciously -- this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series .   it has gorgeous music ,  and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever ,  just brilliant .21 .  battle's red glare -- orcom's men are fighting against an enemy ,  and the wolves are caught in the middle .   we see a lot of blue in this episode  ( she's so cute as a puppy  :  )  and cher .22 .  pieces of a shooting star -- the group decides to cross a sea of ice ,  but it turns out not to be such a good idea  :  (   toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff .i can't say enough about this series -- unless you've seen the whole thing ,  you can't judge it .   it's made by the same people as  " cowboy beebop "  and this dvd is preparing us for the typical bones conclusion  ;  )   the next dvd is way sad and very depressing ;  no matter how tough you are ,  you will be crying by the end
this film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted .  occasionally the film lets itself down with it's editing .  i sometimes feel disorientated thinking  "  wait slow down will you .  "  having said that - this film is well acted ,  and really puts you in the netherlands of the 19th century .  it may not be as hard hitting and exciting as turkish delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching
honestly ,  i wasn't certain about this film ,  in fact ,  at first i actually believed it was related to  " chocolate .  "    i was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised .   upon first viewing ,  i did not laugh as much as the second time .   yes ,  i tend to watch a film twice for i know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories .   i can be more relaxed and open minded the second time .   second viewing was a belly full of laughter .this is the best lesbian comedy i have ever seen .   the acting was wonderful and the film was fast paced .   now that i decided that this film is exceptional ,  it was time to put it to the test on others  ( mostly women 20's - 80's years ,  some men .  )   each person i shared this film with ,  either loaning it or viewing it together ,  all responded similarly :   " this is a hysterically funny film .  "what is even more amazing is the brief allotted time the director accomplished in completing the filming process - about twenty-two days .  congratulations ,  sometimes a tight budget can produce a true work of art .   many short films i have seen on the  " spiritual cinema circle "  also have numerous low budget wonderful productions .   hoorah for the film art genius .i applaud the entire talented cast and crew ,  especially actress ,  christine cox ,  her performance was exceptionally wonderful .   i would like to see her in more comedies .  .  . she's a natural .   i fell  " in love with her "  and i am straight gal ,  as are all of the actresses except for frances .a must see funny film .   i always wondered why the comedy male gay films always had that edge of humor when the lesbian films appeared more serious .   we need more films that are as pleasurable and diversified as  " better than chocolate "  .   thanks bunches .
" office space "  is a very funny comedy .  many parts of the film were a delight .  in the beginning ,  when everyone is stalled in traffic ,  i knew the feeling .  working at initech corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of peter gibbons  ( ron livingston )  .  besides having a job he hates ,  he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is .  then there is his boss lumbergh--an arrogant jerk .  life for peter gibbons is just one boring day after another .  that is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion  [ and demands ]  of his then girlfriend .while undergoing hypnotic suggestion ,  the psychologist dies of a heart-attack .  but peter is now a changed man .  he no longer cares about his job ,  and says whatever's on his mind .  and his boss lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new peter .  when peter learns of the impending layoff  [ courtesy of john c .  mcginley and his partner ]  at initech corporation ,  he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus .   his two fellow co-workers and friends are only too happy to go along :  afterall ,  they're part of the layoff's .  and on top of that ,  the company men want to make peter a supervisor .this film is funny on many levels .  with jennifer anniston as the love interest of peter ,  and the character actors that make up the film--it makes for an enjoyable watch .  jennifer anniston's character and her dealings with her boss and his  " flairs "  are also funny .  this is a highly recommended comedy .  i'm sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between peter and his boss lumbergh .  and the character of his boss lumbergh is delightfully hilarious :  especially the way he talks .  the whole movie is very funny and wonderful .  highly recommended .
i first saw this movie in high school in the theater .   i was extremely moved by the film ,  and it triggered a facination with south asia that lasts to this day - i even work half the year in sri lanka now .   so for me ,  personally ,  this movie is of tremendous influence .i understand the arguements about the crediting of non-white actors ;  i always wondered why candice bergman is given top billing ,  given that she only appears in a very few scenes .   well ,  that's the way of the world - it's marketing right or wrong ,  and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known .   it's not right ,  but that's hollywood .  i mean ,  better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all ,  yes ?and you've got to admit ,  it was quite a debut for ben kingsly .  wow .   he'll be forever known for this role .that aside ,  this is an excellent ,  amazing film .   of course ,  it's still highly relevant ,  perhaps even more so in our post-911 world of fear .the movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration .   a must-see for anyone who feels anger ,  fear ,  agressively nationalistic ,  hopelessness ,  hatred ,  or lost .   i can think of several politicans who need to see this movie
i was just gonna watch the film because i think robert de niro is one of the greatest actors ever ,  but then the film takes on a behind the scenes of being black&that truly adds another factor to this film . it's a trip out film
i saw this movie for the first time when i was 5 .   i'm still watching it at 65 .   they will never be another movie to surpass this one
i like pretty much all of annie leibovitz's photography ,  and if you have noticed her work on magazine stands you'll probably enjoy the book too
i haven't watched the first season - i just started watching the show so i'm a very brand new viewer - but i've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show .   its subject matter is grim ,  yes ,  but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry ,  especially david boreanaz  ( buffy the vampire slayer ,  angel )  and emily deschanel .   the stories are interesting w/out being too scientific so anyone can follow along .   and i never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone's bones  ( okay ,  maybe only in tv land )  .
excellent ,  great camera work ,  very good sound and commentar
cameron crowe ,  rene zelleweger ,  cuba gooding and tom cruise were all at the top of their game .  the superlative fluidity and cinematic thrill of this successful feature was facilitated by experienced actors in sync ,  and guaranteed by superb production and studio crafts .  a timeless classic - in a class of its own .
sunset boulevard is a drama that reveals the unsightly day-to-day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense .  joe gillis  ( william holden )  ,  a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers ,  holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on sunset boulevard .  while walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool ,  he is shocked to discover it's occupied by old silent-film star norma desmond  ( gloria swanson )  .living with a devoted chauffeur ,  estranged from hollywood and forgotten by fans ,  in desmond's mind ,  she is still a star working on her next big roll in a script she has been scribbling for years .  knowing the script doesn't have a chance ,  as a writer ,  joe looks at this as an opportunity to  " fine tune "  it to earn some extra cash .  however ,  the working relationship is not all that tidy .  it seems lonely desmond is looking to sponsor a gigolo .  his payment is a warm place to stay at night ,  a closet full of clothes ,  nice meals ,  private  " parties ,  "  and desmond's ever-present company .if it were possible for desmond's self-admiration to be supplanted by anything ,  it would be the possessiveness for joe's affection .  young joe needs a break from such austere surroundings and eventually goes out to a party with real people and meets a girl engaged to an old friend .  through a series of secret rendezvous they begin to collaborate on a script with real potential and ,  naturally ,  develop feelings for one another .  the girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on sunset boulevard is a formidable challenge .with some of the most memorable quotes in hollywod ,  this is a wonderfully produced  " noir-comic "  drama by billy wilder that well projects the intense emotions ,  not only of each character ,  but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent .  other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are all about eve ,  an imitation of life ,  and what ever happened to baby jane .  a gem on the dvd extras is the history of fashion legend edith head .movie quote :   " there's nothing tragic about being fifty .  not unless you're trying to be twenty-five .
spoilerswhen star trek's production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season ,  they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold the cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode .  the result :  one of the most important and brilliant treks ever done !everyone knows the basic plot by now :  spock kidnaps his crippled former captain ,  and hijacks the enterprise ,  and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all the federation .  he eventually is court-martialed en route ,  and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the enterprise's visit to talos iv 13 years prior .this is the episode which cements spock's character forever :  the supposedly emotionless vulcan ,  who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans .  leonard nimoy's performance is one of his best as spock  :  initially seeming as though spock had gone crazy almost ,  kidnapping pike ,  using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under 'secret orders' ,  all sorts of indications something must be wrong with spock .  .  . until after the talosian's plan is revealed , where it is found they have been manipulating events all along ,  and spock returns to his stoic self .  .  .  .  . except .  . when leaving the briefing room with pike for the last time ,  his head bowed ,  shoulders slumped .shatner's understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles .  i say  : 'unfair' .  .  . frankly ,  it is perfect for the events - all during these events ,  kirk acts rather stunned at all these events :  his friend and 1st officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship ,  he almost dies going after him in a shutle ,  then he is releived of command for all of this !  by the time the talosians supposedly abandon spock and forces the trial board to take a vote ,  even kirk is convinced spock should be put away . but .  . at the end .  . is able to smile when the talosian shows him the 'rejuvenated' pike happy again at last .all of these performances are directed with care by marc daniels ,  the veteran tv director who was at the helm of the 'envelope' .  they make an deliberate  point of cutting to the more mature ,  unemotional spock during the famous 'laughing' scene , and you can almost see a flicker of 'was i that emotional ? ' cross his face !the makeup used on sean kenney ,  the 'substitute' captain pike  ( jeffery hunter was unavailable )  , might be some of the best ever done for any trek :  it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage :  you are totally convinced this is an older ,  horribly maimed jeffrey hunter !some small parts of the cage are cut :  some shots of pike's fellow 'zoo-mates' ,  some very sexist lines about 'women on the bridge' ,  and the obligatory 'aliens running through the computer' scene .  none of these are very important to the plot of either the pilot or the envelope .and just to add some trivia :part ii of the menagerie was the highest rated episode of star trek ever in prime time !actor malachi throne had been the original voice of the talosian keeper in the pilot .  since he was cast as commodore mendez ,  voice artist vic perrin was dubbed in as the keeper .as per the director's guild ,  marc daniels was credited as director for part i ,  while the director of the cage ,  robert  ( mr pilot )  butler ,  was given the screen credit for part ii .the menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish !
i'm another of those who saw this at sundance ,  and all the things i enjoy about gaiman and mckean's graphic novels were on display :  the quiet humor ,  the intelligence ,  the delightful weirdness ,  the astounding visual vocabulary .  except that in this case ,  the words are spoken by good actors ,  and all those visuals get up off their feet and move .it's hard to describe the impact of watching a mckean painting move and talk .  there might be those who quibble about the movie looking too  " animated ,  "  but of course that's exactly the point :  to create a world and make it dance .  the end result ,  visually at least ,  is like nothing you've ever seen before ,  and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone .some of the people i talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull ,  that they had seen it all before .  well ,  it's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve--a little  " alice in wonderland "  here ,  a little  " time bandits "  there ,  a lot of  " wizard of oz "  over here ,  not to mention a resemblance to gaiman's own  " coraline .  "  but i'm just as familiar with those stories as anyone else ,  and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of  " mirrorrmask " --after all ,  it's what you do with a story that determines its success .  and from moment to moment ,  there was enough innovation and cleverness ,  enough delight and wonder ,  to make the movie a positive delight .when the movie came out in theaters i went to see it again ,  and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog ;  then a friend of mine tried to show the dvd to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the spider-thingie .   ( hey ,  in  " wizard of oz "  the moment when the witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me--yet it lingered in memory ,  and when i got older i was drawn back and fell in love with the movie .   that's how this stuff works .  )    " mirrormask "  was probably a little too wild to be a full-out commercial success ;  but i bet it's going to have a long ,  long shelf life on dvd as people pull it out to tell their friends  " wait till you see this .
i knew that i wanted this movie ,  but i had forgotten much of the plot .   it is a pleasure to view this one and recall that movies could be humorous without being decadent ;  that adventure could be portrayed without endless special effects or digital animation or dissonant  " music "  ;  and that the more leisurely pace was relaxing  : - )   suffice to say that both my wife and i found it very enjoyable !the extra clips were fascinating background on making of the movie :   one should not miss reviewing them .   the effort spent on the aircraft alone added a considerable touch of reality
the seconf gig is trying to be good .  i only watch the show just to see the action the story is boring .  i love the being opening scene with the music playing even the animation is a little better then the first season .  and its a bit more mature then the first season
i bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me .   i enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also .  times and styles may have changed ,  but i believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did .  simple ,  but great movie .   my only regret is that it wasn't close captioned
ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house .  8 women ,  every one of them with their affective lacks ,  their tribulations .  little miseries ,  sorrows and disillusions .  each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered marcel .the admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage ,  with a sublime red carpet that remind us bergman in cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top alfred hitchcock  ( vertigo )  expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film ,  plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses .a must-see !
it is the ultima of cgi video game movies .  i must buy for final fantasy addicts .
recently realizing that jackie chan and jet li are about done with movie making for the most part ,  i always wondered if there was anyone who could take over .   chan and li are one of a kind and the best out there .   fortunately ,  tony jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own .   the first thing i like about tony jaa is he is an expert in muay thai fighting ,  something new and original for the good guy in a movie .   the next thing i like is that he fights like jet li and does stunts like jackie chan ,  though once again he adds his own originality quite often .ong bak is pure action excitement - don't expect a deep story and do expect horrible english dubbing that is just down right annoying  ( you can still switch to subtitles with thai spoken if desired )  .   if these 2 things don't matter to you ,  this movie just plains rocks .   its a bit slow here and there ,  but overall it is filled with all the action you could want - illegal club fights ,  an incredible club brawl fight ,  tons of stunts and chases ,  a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars ,  a ring fight ,  and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts ,  lasting for a good 10 minutes .   i also liked the background music for the movie - lots of smooth laid-back hip hop beats .i'm pleased to say that with newcomer tony jaa to the world of martial arts films ,  the loss of chan and li someday soon won't be as bad .   ong bak is brilliant action and originality .  the only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing ,  which chan and li movies do much better
using the g8 summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed  ( at least to me )  like a recipe for disaster ,  but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by bill nighy ,   the girl in the cafe is an unexpected gem .  don't miss it .
the guy shirtless ,  tied up ,  abs muscles so vulnerables to let the punisher to torture this guy until he cant almost breath and cry for mercy .  .  . just an upper stomach being beaten to make this guy suffer a pain he will never forget .  .
a family oriented film that is humorous ,  fun ,  exciting and very entertaining !  after seeing this movie for the first time ,  i had to own it !  it is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean .  this is a must own for the family
a deeply emotional film about addiction ,  love ,  and family just to some ,  but when you watch this film you take something with you  ,  something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted ,  life .  each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending ,  really depressing movie but worth a look at least once .  marlon wayans and jennifer connelly were extremely good but ellen burstyn broke my heart her performance rocked
you gotta get the whole series .  .  .  . you can't just get one or two dvds .  .  . you need the whole thing ,  trust me .   once you start you gotta go all the way to the end
i love all the rockford file's .  and this collection is very good ,  i cant wait till the third season comes ou
ever wonder where col .  kurtz would've ended up if he had survived the end of  " apocalypse now "  ?  well ,  now we know :  he exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals -- the horror ,  the horror .in light of all the bad press one would really think this is a lousy movie .  and i can see why some people don't like it ,  the main portion of the flick is really insane .  however ,  if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the heavy mood & insanity of  " apocalypse now ,  "  you'll probably like it .  i'm not saying it's anywhere near as great as  " apocalypse now "  but marlon brando and the jungle insanity make the comparison inevitable .what works :  the title sequence is great ,  perhaps one of the best in all of cinema  ( another amazon reviewer noted this ,  so i'm not alone )  ;  the soundtrack is phenomenal  ( 'nuff said )  ;  the plot is intriguing ;  the humanimal make-up is fine  ( 'hyena' looks especially horrific )  ;  the film possesses an undeniable creative pizzazz  ( i . e .  it's moody ,  atmospheric and insane )  ;  and marlon brando's 35 minute stint in the film is as captivating as always  ( you can probably tell i'm a huge brando fan -- in particular ,   " one-eyed jacks ,  "   " mutiny on the bounty "   ( 1962 )  ,   " the young lions ,  "   " superman "  and  " apocalypse now "   [ not  " redux "  ]  )  .what doesn't work :  the third act of the film is almost total insanity ,  except for the final ten minutes or so ;  as a result the story will lose the interest of those who have no appreciation for such artistic flair .closing thoughts :  i really enjoyed seeing brando in his old age in this flick ;  it proves he had his magnetic charm until the end .  if you enjoyed brando as 'kurtz' in  " apocalypse now "  you'll appeciate him in  " island ;  "  in fact ,  as already noted ,  dr .  moreau is a variation of kurtz in his old age  ( i . e .  nutjob in the jungle )  .if you're predisposed for such a flick ,   " dr .  moreau "  is weird ,  but certainly worthwhile .

" the medium "  instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005 .   i usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal ,  which tuned me in .   however ,  it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating .   patricia arquette who was in  " ed wood "  with johnny depp plays alison dubois .   her emmy win for best actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry ,  but the on-screen chemistry with jake weber who was in  " meet joe black "  and plays her husband joe is riveting .   they fight ,  spat ,  try to mask conflict in front of their kids ,  juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks ,  and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of alison's psychic ability .   i found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show ,  i still wanted to watch them over episodes of csi miami that i had not seen .    when i bought the dvd ,  i was hoping there might have been an episode i'd missed ,  but i'd seen them all between nbc & lifetime reruns several times .   i'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing .   alison's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together .   what impresses me about alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing .   in a world of violence ,  it's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points .   in the episode  " in sickness & adultery "  her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her .   as she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife ,  she finds that her best defense is the truth .   the two older daughters are also jewels .   maria lark as bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream ,   " mom ,  please stop doing that !  "   sofia vassilieva as the older aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing .   david cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with arquette .   miguel sandoval as the district attorney manuel duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show .    ( perhaps we will sometime see more about his family .  )   while it's hard to pick my favorite first season episode ,  the complex plot of  " a priest ,  a doctor & medium walk into an execution chamber "  is a jewel ,  with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder .   the dvd commentaries and introduction to the real-life alison dubois really give excellent background for fans of the show .   this is one show that reaches the level of art for me .   its excellence will make it memorable for a long time & this dvd collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection .   bravo
bergman first introduced us to johan and marianne in his 1974 masterpiece scenes from a marriage ,  one of the cinema's most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect .   bergman and the splendid scandanavian actors erland josephson and liv ullmann took us through johan and marianne's marriage ,  divorce ,  and post-divorce reconciliation .   in the end ,  they live apart ,  but still make room for the bond between them .three decades later ,  bergman ,  josephson and ullmann have given us saraband ,  a late-life gift .   marianne decides that even though she hasn't seen johan since the 1970s ,  it's time to make contact again .   johan has inherited money from an aunt ,  and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake .   she literally wakes him with a kiss ,  but soon enough marianne's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in johan's family .henrik ,  johan's son ,  is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter karin .   both of them still mourn anna ,  henrik's wife and karin's mother ,  who died two years before .   henrik ,  a music teacher ,  is preparing karin ,  an accomplished cellist ,  for her conservatory entrance exams .   the elderly johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic  ( not unlike bergman's own father )  and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him .   henrik wants his father's affection and acceptance ,  even though johan refuses to give it ,  ostensibly due to some slight by henrik when he was 19 years old .   in a painful scene ,  henrik goes to johan to ask for money to help karin ,  and in his 61 year old face ,  we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father .for karin ,  her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father .   karin struggles to figure out what she owes henrik ,  what she owes to the memory of her mother ,  and what she owes to herself .   she lets marianne see some ,  but not all ,  of the turmoil she's going through .   for marianne ,  her attraction to johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him .   she's always wanted something from him ,  but since she can't define what it is ,  she'll probably never get it .the struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by marianne's opening and closing monologues .   karin makes her choices .   henrik reacts .   marianne throws herself once more against johan's emotional aloofness .   as he's done throughout his brilliant career ,  bergman brings it alive through artful dialog ,  perfect dramatic timing ,  and riveting cinematic composition .   the characters are not always likable ,  but they are never less than engrossing .the criterion's dvd includes a mini-documentary of bergman making saraband .   we watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking ,  kid around with the crew ,  poke and prod his actors into position .   it's a treat to watch him work .   one wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from julia dufvenius ,  the fine young actress who plays karin .   one also wonders why bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he'd announced he was through .bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection .   apparently he wants to say one last thing about it ,  which seems to be this :   after all the tears and shouting ,  all the posturing and cruelty ,  all the reaching out and pulling back ,  this is what remains :   marriages of true minds  ( the photo of anna used in the film is a picture of bergman's great love ,  his deceased wife ingrid )  ;  the fraught ties of fathers and sons ;  memories of old loves ;  what you give and get from children ;  and the devolution of the flesh .   none of it is easy ,  the master tells us ,  but all of it is necessary .   in the end ,  it's all you have .what's truly sad is that bergman ,  sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey ,  claims that he's done .   he did for film what shakespeare did for theater ,  took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving .   he will certainly be missed and he can't be replaced .but don't see saraband for nostalgic reasons .   it's a moving ,  insightful film that deserves a place in the director's canon .   saraband stands on its own ,  but it's a deeper experience if you watch scenes from a marriage first .
my 2 year old loves watching the dvd as well as listening to the cd in the car .   i have to admit that i have memorized all of the songs on the cd and the dances on the dvd too .  .  . they are very catchy and i find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around !   the lyrics are really cute and the beats are great .   simple music but very creative .   i signed up for updates on laurie berkner's website so i can find out when/if she ever comes to town so my daughter  ( and i ,  of course )  can go see her .   she is a great alternative to barney and all of the other commercial characters ,  who i don't care much for .   i have bought this dvd/cd combo for all of my friends who have kids
r . j .  the raccoon  ( bruce willis )  was just looking for something to eat as he stumbles into his bear friend's  ( nick nolte )  cave and accidently destroys his food ,  he has an entire week to find almost every scrap of food for him or else he dies .  he finds a family of animals  ( gary shandling ,  william shatner ,  wanda sykes ,  steve carrell ,  eugene levy ,  catherine o'hara ,  avril lavigne )  and uses them for his scheme to go over the large hedge near their territory to the suburbs where they steal food from the humans .  later on ,  the home-owner gladys  ( allison janey )  hires professional exterminator dwayne  ( thomas hayden church )  to kill them but can rj save his own life or his new friends's ?extremely entertaining and fantastic cgi animated comedy from the makers of  " shrek 1 & 2 "  ,   " antz "  and  " madagscar "  dreamworks provides great realistic cgi and laughs for everybody .  there's also heart in this movie and shows the meaning of what it is like to have friends and be one's true self instead of being selfish !  steve carrell's character hammy the squirrel steals the show here as the best character in the movie ,  it's a wonderful and hilarious movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults .this dvd has some good extras like two sneek previews to  " shrek 3 "  and  " bee-movie "  ,  audio commentary ,  behind-the-scenes featurette ,  vernetech commercial ,  games ,  meet the cast featurette and gallery .highly recommended !  the best dreamworks animated movie since  " shrek 1 & 2 "
sybil is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public .  the performances by sally field and joanne woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter  ( child abuse )  and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed .  wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques ,  both the book and the movie became musts for students of abnormal psychology at that time and for decades afterwards .joanne woodward reverses her roles from  " the three faces of eve "  to portray dr .  cornelia wilbur with consummate skill ,  while sally field's performance as sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another  ( the movie works with thirteen of the book's sixteen personalities )  .   without being overtly graphic ,  the movie conveys all of the horrors of sybil's childhood with an incredible impact .the rest of the cast is excellent ,  with martine bartlett's  " hattie "  ,  sybil's mother ,  in the chilling forefront and natasha ryan as little sybil close behind .the real sybil ,  unaware that sally field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with joanne woodward ,  let it be known that she wanted stewart stern and daniel petrie to try and get sally for her part .   { from the extras bonus disk )i can't recommend the movie and the book enough to students of human behavior and psychology ,  whether for personal of professional interests .it took hollywood 30 years to try remaking the film ,  which should indicate how high the bar was set by this original cast and production
this is an outstanding dvd .   i highly recommend it .   if you have seen riverdance live you can relive the great moments .   if you haven't seen riverdance live you are in for a real treat with this dvd from the comfort of your own home
it's a ritual for my 5 year ld daughter and her dad to watch samurai jack before bed .  back when she was 3 ,  and it was played on cartoon network ,  they made sure to watch it together .  now that cartoon network is retarded and they don't play it anymore ,  i've bought seasons 1 and 2 .  i just wish it was played on cartoon network like it used to be .   .  .  . jill henrichse
introduction3 games to glory iii is a two-disc video compilation of the 2004 new england patriots playoffs ,  including their super bowl victory over the philadelphia eagles 24-21 in super bowl xxxix .   this super bowl victory was the patriots third in four years ,  marking them as the team of `00s .   for new england patriots fans it's a chance to relive the glory of back-to-back super bowl victories and three championships in four years .   non-new england patriots fans probably would not particularly enjoy this in-depth video .main features3 games to glory iii provides extensive highlights of both new england patriots' playoff wins and super bowl victory after the 2004 season .these playoffs found new england once again schooling the indianapolis colts in yet another year where peyton manning and the vaunted colts offensive choke under playoff pressure .   the high flying colts offense was throttled by the superior schemes and tough play of the patriots in a 20-3 afc divisional playoff win at gillette stadium in foxborough ,  massachusetts .this is followed by new england's dramatic defeat of the pittsburgh steelers ,  41-27 ,  in the afc championship game at heinz field in pittsburgh .   the patriots entered this game as decided underdogs to the 15-1 steelers after being throttled by pittsburgh earlier in the season .finally ,  you get to enjoy the extensive highlights of new england's impressive 24-21 win over the nfc champion philadelphia eagles .   this is yet another game where new england's superior execution and stamina in the later stages of the game brought them ultimate glory .   the super bowl was played in jacksonville ,  florida on february 6 ,  2005 .the highlights of each game are very extensive and seem to cover nearly every play .   they are also mostly well done ,  but frankly the highlights often fail to capture the real drama of the game .   of course no highlight reel can match the excitement and drama of a live contest ,  but there are times when key turning points of the game really just become another quick hit in the video .there are a few disappointments in this video though and it's not quite as well done as the preceding 3 games to glory ii  ( covering the patriots playoff run and super bowl victory after the 2003 season )  .   first ,  there is not as much pre-game drama and preparation presented in these videos compared to last year .   secondly ,  there are not as many close up ,  on the field shots that bring the game right into your living room .   it's much more distant and not as close up as previous editions in this series .despite these drawbacks ,  it's still great to relive a great season through these videos .bonus featuresthe bonus features on this edition of 3 games to glory are not nearly as good as the ones on 3 games to glory ii .   the bonus features are nice they just didn't live up the standard in the previous edition .   following is a brief rundown of what you'll get on the dvd .there are some  " bill belichick "  breakdowns of key plays for each game but there are very few of them and really leaves the viewer wanting more .there's also a  " points after :  sounds of the game "  which shows post-super bowl press conference features ,  but again ,  it's really short and leaves you wanting more .the  " patriot's all access "  which appears along with each of the playoff and super bowl wins shows locker room scenes and practices ,  team meetings ,  and other shots of players as they prepare for games .   these are pretty well done short features that add a great deal to the video .the  " all access "  section for the super bowl of course included pre-game plane trip ,  post game party and the parade .   i find these a bit boring frankly ,  but i guess it's nice to see the players up close on their daily routines .the super bowl highlights are shown twice ,  once with the regular commentary and once with commentary from rosevelt colvin  ( lb )  ,  ted johnson  ( lb )  ,  and matt light  ( t )  .   matt light is a funny guy and this was more entertaining than the one last year .i thought the best bonus feature was one on disc two called  " views from the past "  with interviews with three great players from previous decades - gino cappelletti of the 1960's ,  michael haynes of the 1970's ,  and andre tippett of the 1980's and 1990's .   this conversation was mostly about comparing this current patriots' team with teams of the past and how the game has changed over the decades .finally ,  the video has the 2005 playoff roster ,  super bowl stats ,  and 2005 game by game results - just like you can get in any book ,  it just shows it printed on the screen .overall ,  while all these bonus features are nice ,  3 games to glory iii is not nearly as good as 3 games to glory ii .   it did not include an extensive behind the scenes segment on the super bowl ,  which i found fascinating on the previous edition ,  nor did it have highlights for each game of the regular season like the previous edition .   i found the lack of these too items very disappointing as i thought they were outstanding editions to last year's disc .nevertheless ,  the bonus features overall are nice ,  just nice as nice as last time .bottom lineall new england fans should enjoy reliving a third super bowl win through this highlights package .   it's mostly well done and certainly brings back great memories of a great season .   those who are not patriots fans i am sure would find the video quite boring .disclaimer :   i am a die hard new england patriots fan and am totally biased in this review
`ben-hur' released in '59 is an inspirational tale of betrayal and revenge ,  love and endurance ,  forgiveness and redemption played out amidst the backdrop of the last years of jesus christ's earthly ministry .plot :  judah ben-hur  ( charleton heston )  ,  a wealthy jew living in the holy land is falsely accused of crimes against rome and sent off to spend the rest of his days as a slave on a roman galley .  his estate is confiscated ,  his mother and sister thrown into prison .  his accuser is a roman officer named messala  ( stephen boyd )  ,  judah's best friend since childhood .judah survives the hardships of slavery ,  gains his freedom and eventually becomes the adopted son of a powerful and wealthy roman reagent .  providence certainly appears to be guiding judah's path .  however judah's heart is filled with hate for messala .  he cannot forgive or forget what he and rome has done to him and his family .  he returns home in an attempt to restore what he has unjustly lost and avenge himself against his old friend .winner of 11 academy awards 'ben-hur' is truly an epic among epics .  the massive backgrounds and sets will take your breath away ,  but the true beauty and strength of this film is found in the story it tells and the incredible cast that brings this story to life .  the most memorable scenes in `ben-hur' are the intimate moments ,  the quiet conversations ,  the longing glances .  my personal favorite moment is when judah finds himself falling hopelessly in love with esther  ( haya haraeet )  one of his house slaves .  while granting her freedom so she may be free to leave his service and marry ,  he places her slave ring on his own finger as a symbol of his undying love for her .if you don't have a copy of ben-hur in your dvd library ,  you don't have a dvd library
as i have found with most baby einstein movies ,  this one engages my very active 10-month-old baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy .  while i know that watching tv too much is unhealthy ,  she will not even give regular television a second gland  ( which i'm glad about )  .  however ,  there are times when i need her to be more calm like when i change a diaper ,  try feeding new foods ,  and right before and after naps .  these movies have been lifesavers to me .this one in particular is nice because it is introducing the body by identifying the same parts on babies and animals .  i love to give her a bath and do the  " head and shoulders ,  knees and toes "  song with her and point to the different parts .  she also loves to stand in front of a mirror and we'll point out our eyes ,  mouths ,  etc .  this movie is a great introduction for babies and toddlers to understand their body parts .
i never tire of this film .  the acting , the marvelous filming locations ,  the costumes .  .  .  .  perfection .  i can't watch it without wanting to have a cup of tea and a hot scone to accompany the viewing .  in fact ,  i once stopped the video ,  baked scones ,  and continued to watch it while munching a freshly baked scone and a cuppa .  try it .  i now own the dvd also
" fargo "  is a very good film .  the cohen brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film .  the film stars jerry lundegaard  ( william h .  macy )  as a car salesman in dire need of money .  when he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom ,  things go from bad to worse .  i couldn't help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers .  the father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom ,  and decides to act on his own .  jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess .  moreover ,  he has a saavy police chief  ( mcdormand )  on the case .the film is a definite black-comedy ,  as many of the cohen brother's films are .  this one is a bit more disturbing than usual however .  hot on the case is a policewoman ,  marge gunderson  ( frances mcdormand )  .  she is witty and intelligent and knows something is not right .  steve buscemi stars as one of the kidnappers ,  and his partner has a few loose marbles .  the film is a delightful  [ at times funny ]  film that is highly recommended .  moreover ,  there are many colorful and funny character actors in the film ,  which only enhance the films appeal .  there are also some disturbing scenes ,  however ,  the film is well worth the watch and purchase .  highly recommended .   [ stars :  4 . 5
this movie is really good for the pre-teen who is struggling to make the right choices .   i thought this movie was great !  im hearing that now girls as young as 8 are having oral sex because they want to be popular/cool and i like this movie because it shows the consequences of doing the wrong thing just to be popular .   every young girl needs to see this one
this film is a gripping true life portrait of the path poverty takes when it  ( poverty )  decides to destroy life and hurt those who cannot defeat its ties of depression .one of the strongest film ever seen !  !  !   a must see
leave it to the coen brothers to make werner heisenberg's uncertainty principle the crux of a film noir ,  and darned if they don't make a good case for it in  " the man who wasn't there .  "   ( typically ,  they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who can't even remember heisenberg's name .  )  chain-smoking nebbish barber ed crane  ( billy bob thornton )  makes the only decisive  ( and dishonest )  action of his life ,  and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several ,  mostly not-so-innocent ,  bystanders .  in  " the man who wasn't there ,  "  the phrase  " decisive action "  is an oxymoron ;  everything crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance .  everything that happens--from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face--changes everything forever ,  and always for the worse .  set in 1949 in santa rosa ,  calif .   ( a tip of the hat to hitchcock and  " shadow of a doubt ,  "  perhaps ?  )   " the man who wasn't there "  looks perfect .  like every other coen film ,  it's a marvel of production design ,  and the genius photographer roger deakins nails to a tree the dusty black-and-white look of such classic noirs as  " double indemnity "  and  " out of the past .  "  thematically ,  however ,   " the man who wasn't there "  resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant ,  much better acted remake of edgar g .  ulmer's  " detour ,  "  in which the characters drift in a low-rent sartrean hell ,  totally the victims of fate .  but whereas  " detour "  is more than the sum of its parts ,   " the man who wasn't there "  is less .  the coen brothers may believe in chance ,  but on the screen they leave nothing to chance ,  so that everything in  " the man who wasn't there "  is too perfect .  in the end the film has the same overstudied ,  clinical quality that afflicts every coen film except  " fargo .  "   ( it must be admitted ,  though ,  that only one coen film-- " the hudsucker proxy " --is ruined by that quality .  )  the acting is as superb as in any coen film .  thornton--in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together--burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense ,  hangdog gravity .  there are also glittering supporting performances by frances mcdormand as thornton's philandering wife doris ;  james gandolfini as her paramour and boss ;  jon polito as a shady businessman ;  michael badalucco as thornton's motormouth brother-in-law ;  scarlett johansson as the teenager thornton chastely fancies ;  and especially tony shalhoub ,  nearly stealing the picture as freddy riedenschneider ,  defense attorney extraordinaire .
gosh .  the other reviewer ,  who seems to me ,  only watched the first four episodes of this series and judged the title soley on that .   oh ,  and  on the dvd covers .   this isn't the first anime to have 'fan service' on the dvd covers .   look at kiddy grade ,  an anime that this tweedledum65 reccommends over r . o . d tv .   i'm not going to get into details on this anime ,  for good reviews check out www . themanime . org ,  i'm just saying i liked it ,  and if you're paitient ,  and like a good mystery ,  i hope you find this series just as enjoyable as i do .
the premier american cinematic drama is the western ,  and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns .  this set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot ,  every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side .  there aren't any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections .it's true that the majority of these are b-films ,  and some are unintentionally hilarious to view today .  there are some definite classics  ( mcclintock ,  under california stars )  along with plenty of simply enjoyable films .just a note ,  there are a few mistakes .  for example ,   " the santa fe trail "  included on this set is *not* the 1930 richard arlen version .  it's the 1940s errol flynn ,  olivia haviland version - which i personally feel is superior anyway .  also ,  some films were taken either directly from television  ( you'll see a in stereo flash across the screen when you play the film )  or didn't transfer very well  ( slight distortions in video or audio )  - but considering the age of these movies and the cheap price tag this is an amazing deal !
a great behind-the-scenes look at decisions that shaped history - and nearly killed all of us .cross-reference this with the more recent kennedy biographies for a wider ,  sobering context .this is the sort of thing that the bush administration should have watched before deciding to invade iraq .
i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it  i love it !  !  !  !this dvd is fantastic !  !  !  !  !  !
what a great story and an ending !   i was so excited about the conclusion of this 2 hr program that i coudn't sleep at all
this film is the best film that disney has in it's live-action collection !  every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life .  i really like all the extras on the disc as well i like seeing how the film was created ,  looking at deleted scenes ,  learning about the history of real pirates ,  and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of walt disney himself
for those seeking a captivating 99 minute escape from reality into a beautifully filmed ,  flawlessly written ,  directed & acted world of fantasy this is the must see movie for you .  the character's ryan  ( ryan kelly )  ,  melanie  ( hayden panettiere )  ,  and grandpa  ( armin mueller-stahl )  will collectively take you on a memorable journey you'll want to take over and over .the  " special feature "  music video  ( someone like you ) of hayden is worth the purchase price in itself .pop a bag of popcorn ,  and invite the whole family over for this one ,  .  . they will be thanking you afterward .
i first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved isabeau and navarre ever since .   this movie has it all :  comedy ,  drama ,  and one amazing love story .   who's heart didn't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise ?   navarre's devotion was utterly breathtaking .   a wonderful ,  wonderful film
i have a few friends who  " don't like cartoons "  .  i guess they were brought up on hannah-barbara drek and it turned them off of the whole genre .  when i run into this attitude , i pull out spirited away and my neighbor totoroto show them the beauty ,  subtly ,  and power of animation .
i found the movie to be very creative and unique .  i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage set-up for a play would be .  i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the words/message .  there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed :  greed ;  true love ;  spirituality ;  determination ;  self-esteem issues ;  and jealousy .  i am not a prince fan ,  but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day ,  and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman ,  who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them  ( clever )  .  i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic ,  morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won
this dvd is hilarious .  .  ultimate warrior was a pretty cool character but legally changing his name to the warrior .  .  .  that is downright weird .  christain is too funny in his impressionation
this movie is worth owning .  it's a classic tale ,  well done and very entertaining
absolutely brilliant !  if you are a south park fan ,  this has got to be added to your collection .  matt and trey have lost none of their wit and i can't wait until the eigth season is released !  i had to purchase it from the usa  ( i live in england )  as it's not yet available over here and it actually cost less to buy and have it shipped over than it was to buy the previous six seasons in the shops
love shelly long movies ,  and bette midler too .   this is very enjoyable and funny .   was thrilled to have found a copy on amazon .
this is a must-have dvd ,  not only for wrasslin' fans ,  but for all of mankind .  you will learn the ways of the warrior and hopefully learn something about yourself as well .
we have both of these ,  although we purchased them seperately .  save yourself the time and money and just get them together .  the magical halloween adventure has characters picking out costumes to wear and then it goes into hayrides ,  pumpkin patches ,  carving pumpkins and making cider .  there is a cute songs about monsters not being scary .  the elmo says boo !  one has cute songs with different poeple and charcters and of course has elmo all over it .  we have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that .  in my opinion ,  they are not scary .  also ,  we watch them year round .  .  . especially the elmo one .  she will pull it out and ask for it .  .  . who knew you could have halloween in july ?  ?
you can't really call yourself a pauly shore fan unless you love son-in-law .  and it's hard not to love this movie .  granted ,  it is prone to a bit of cheesiness ,  but this is what we both love and respect about pauly shore .  becca is a fresh from the farm in south dakota ,  now in california at college and on her own for the first time .  she misses her family and her jock boyfriend back home and feels like she doesn't fit in .  but crawl  ( pauly shore ,  in perfect pauly form )  her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be .  when the holidays roll around ,  crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for thanksgiving ,  but becca insists he join her and her family in south dakota .  crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that's not enough to make things silly ,  becca's boyfriend tries to propose to her ,  but becca doesn't want to get married yet and crawl announces to the family that he's already proposed to becca .  now absolute silliness takes over and it's just so much fun from here on out .  if you need something fun and funny to watch ,  give son-in-law a try .  one of my all-time favorites in my collection of silly comedies .  you'll love it
sure ,  i could have compared phantom quest corp .  to a lot of other animes out there ,  but the basic premise is the same -- we get a group of people who are working together to solve sci-fi mysteries .  .  . and there is definitely nothing wrong with that .a friend of mine introduced me to this series ,  and i must say that i was pleasantly surprised overall .if you love having vampires and mummies ,  among other things ,  show up in your anime ,  along with a huge dosage of humor to boot ,  then you will absolutely love this show -- it manages to take dark subject matter and make it into something comical .i think the biggest weakness in this series is definitely a coherent side story -- it seems like things are a little too hashed together at times ,  and a little too rushed .  on top of that ,  half of the phantom quest team only shows up when actually needed to do something ,  such as the team exorcist and the fortune teller -- neither of these two characters really gets a strong introduction at all .one more weakness would really be in the music as well ,  which i found continuously grating on my nerves -- mainly ,  the theme song .  most of the other music is just merely ok .complaints aside ,  this is definitely worth your time ,  especially for such a small price -- buy this one ,  you certainly won't regret it
i really ejoyed this film . i can't wait to watch it again . this christmas flick has a great angle , and a wonderfull ending . i always liked the traditional holiday movies ,  " white christmas , holiday inn ,  "  now  " surviving christmas "  is included
based on the early-movie cliffhangers he used to watch in theaters ,  george lucas created something special :  a re-invention of the entire adventure genre .  these films waited a long time to make their bow on dvd ,  much too long for myself ,  personally .  i always loved these films ,  they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time .  each of the three films is very different from the others .   " raiders of the lost ark "  ,  the first and best of the three ,  introduces us to indiana jones ,  perhaps lucas's greatest creation .  premiering in 1981 ,  this film was a smash ,  also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture .  also starring was karen allen ,  perhaps the most even-matched female co-star for harrisan ford .  it seemed she could give as good she got ,  and never backed down in any scene .  second was  " the temple of doom "  ,  easily the darkest of the three ,  and the most intensely exciting .  this film is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish ,  and doesn't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor .  the third film ,   " the last crusade "  ,  is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor ,  and has the wonderful sean connery to steal every scene he's in .  the interaction between indy and mr .  jones is wonderful .  if anyone was to ever play indiana jones' father ,  it was sean connery .  the forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features ,  which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves .  these films waited far too long to be released to dvd ,  and i lay the blame squarely on george lucas .  i've heard he really didn't think dvd would take off like it did ,  that it was just a phase .  it's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy .  as with his  " star wars "  trilogy ,  the indiana jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all dvd collections
i have watched this movie four times now ,  and every time at the end of the movie i am crying like a baby .  .  .  .  .  it's so sad !  !  !  but still so good
after spinal tap ,  this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown .   but like st ,  it is right on .   these wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it's satire ,  it's real .   if you hate even the idea of folk music ,  skip it--or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people .   if you were there--i was--it's a real hoot ( enanny )  !   sadly ,  here in california ,  they were to be found en masse at every local 99 cents only stores .   i realize this is not for everyone ,  but neither was spinal tap .   give it a try
this dvd shows shania's potential as a serious musician .  with alison krauss and union station as her back up here ,  she is simply riveting .  too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like  " up !  "  instead of making enduring popular country classics like  " the woman in me "  and  " come on over "  .  maybe she's living too well nowadays to make soulful music .  get this dvd if you want to hear shania doing something good .4 stars is for the short length of this dvd .  we need at least 2 hours of this awesome music .  not the 50 minutes which is on this dvd .  that's only enough time to drink 5 beers
i'm mildly into anime ,  i only watch the stuff that i really enjoy .  this is the only series that has really drawn me in .  usually it's just movies for me but wolf's rain is amazing .  i can't wait for volume ii to be released on tuesday !  it contains the final episodes  ( 19-30 )  .
the direction of this film is excellent .   i love all the characters and the way they interact .   the storyline is very important also .   it's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other .   it's a well-paced and interesting story that's not like anything else i've ever seen .
this is the classic ww2 submarine war movie ,  and most ww2 submarine vets will tell you that this is the best movie .   i greatly enjoyed it and it is true sub action ,  based on what i read about ww2 submarines .   the special effects are a bit cheesy ,  you can see the wires pulling the torpedos and you can tell that they used scaled model ships .  .  . but if you overlook those items ,  you get fine acting and a good plot with plenty ofaction
ok ,  so it may not be in the 5-star league ,  but it's a great movie particularly for those who are involved in scouting .  my scouts think it's too funny
when i read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts .   i thought ,   " yeah ,  right .  "   but you really can pick and chose and combine what you want .   you can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio .   it is up to you .   or you can choose from the basic low ,  medium ,  or high intesity workouts .   this is a great workout dvd and denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part .   i'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home
his words to the jury ,  a petition for strength for them against great odds ,  for himself against greater odds ,  for a system sometimes blind to justice ,  and for the victim of negligence who has no voice ,  puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'the verdict . 'tv bytes and news reports of lawyers' greed today have surpassed the image of scoundrels as nearly all of us now just leave them to their money-grubbing best .  and the courage and brilliance of  " brown v .  board "  and  " heart of atlanta "  exemplifying courageous men and women doing what is best fade into a distant past .  but once in while a movie  ( 'mockingbird' )  comes along and moves powerfully to recall what it was that attracted us to the beauty of this ancient profession :  to do what is right ,  or even better ,  to do what is right against great odds .frank galvin ,  drunk ,  ambulance chaser ,  liar ,  failure ,  had that dream once but a mistake ,  an error of judgemnt ,  a naive trust in loyalty that was gravely misplaced led him to where he is now ,  sucking on breath mints and bourbon ,  handing out cards ,  working for booze money .his old friend jack warden handed him a case ,  a no-brainer ,  a lovely irish girl who went into labor and came out brain dead .  the defendants ?  a squeaky clean ,  chaired ,  lauded ,  published and handsome obgyn and   .   .   .   .  the diocese of boston .  and frank's going to cave .  hell .  it's the eve of trial and he's been drunk through the 24 months of discovery .  and then he prepares for the settlement conference with the dfense lawyer ,  james mason  ( just positively brilliant )  and goes to the girls hospital room where she is machine fed and takes photos .  but a funny thing happens .  lke marcellus  ( burton )  winning the robe in the lottery at the foot of the cross or a drunk at his first aa meeting ,  frank's not sure but something's different .  and he begins to wonder if maybe this time he won't cave .great ,  morbid ,  wry ,  ironic ,  gallows humor .  warden says after the settlement conference ,   " whadja' think of  ( mason )  ?  "  galvin :  he's good .  warden :  good ?  he's the   [  .   .   .   .   .  ]  prince of darkness .a cast that you have heard of and seen a thousand times and some that you would never see again all working together to bring you a blue collar story of the good thief .  i don't know that there is a better trial movie .people say that newman lost but wasn't robbed for the oscar because ben kingley was so wonderful in ghandi .he was robbed .  5 stars .  larry scantlebury
a great reality show ,  following a group of working class youths in england getting the chance to become cooks in a top uk restaurant for free .   it's highly entertaining and well worth the price .   we caught this show when we were visiting australia and got hooked .   also check out jamie's school dinners series ,  available on amazon uk
this is the kind of movie i used to enjoy seeing a couple of times a year and now see ,  oh ,  about once every 10 years or so .   an incredibly interesting ,  odd ,  provocative movie ,  that doesn't insult its audience .   the acting is phenomenal ,  the script is really interesting ,  and the characters are not people you've seen 1000 times before .   although it's sort of about baseball ,  it's not a baseball movie .   it's a pity that so few people want to see interesting movies like this .   i loved this movie .
where did this guy come from ?   my daughter rented this eddie izzard dvd .   i was blind-sided with the sophisticated ,  mime-style humor of eddie izzard  ( is this his real name ?   is he really a  " he "  ?  )  .   from hearing about genesis to wondering why noah had to get two of everything .  .  .  including ducks .  .  .  ,  eddie izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy .   nothing was off limits .  .  .  the queen mother ,  death ,  hopscotch ,  speed archeology ,  toasters ,  and achilles .   it is all here !take special note of the set .  .  .  very minimalist .   izzard uses his talents to make you  " see "  what he is describing ,  without depending on props .   from swords to hoovers ,  you will get his meaning .rated r for mild profanity ,  and i for irreligious
now it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004 .   a relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them .bob roberts ,  a son of a hippy couple rebels against that world view and uses music as a means of spreading conservative propaganda .   marketing hate and intolerance in the flag ,  this movie frighteningly shows in fiction what is being done in reality today .i think bob roberts will be a movie that historians will study 200 years ago and see it relevant for discussion of the united states around the turn of the millenium .
hey richie ,  get a life .  .  .everyone else ,  check out dh ,  it's a great show
respiro is one of those italian treasures of a film ,  this time written and directed by the insightful emanuele crialese ,  that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and  foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story .   respiro mixes the gut-level italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by fellini .lampedusa is a mediterranean island between sicily and tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of italy to be a return to the native .   the population is all involved in fishing .   on this picturesque island lives grazia  ( the beautiful and talented valeria golina )  who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality .   she lives happily with her fisherman husband pietro and her children :  teenage marinella  ( veronica d'agostini )  ,  pasquale  ( frncesco casisa - a very fine little actor !  )  and filippo  ( filippo pucillo )  .   the boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother's wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace .when grazia's actions come under scrutiny by pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother  ( muzzi loffredo )  who occasionally gives grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests grazia needs psychiatric help in milan ,  grazia runs away to hide in a grotto ,  her whereabouts are known only to pasquale .the little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of grazia ,  only to discover on st bartolo's day that grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean .   how this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie :  revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of respiro .   suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away !this little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography - both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean - of any film you'll see .   the music by john surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric .   the way director crialese  captures the folklore-like behavior of the youngsters' games ,  and the married-to-the-sea philosophy of the villagers ,  is utterly magical .   this is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society .   respiro is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to eden .   in italian with english subtitles .    grady harp ,  november 200
where do i start ?  jack nicolson  is a magnificant actor .  he can play anybody  and his performance in this film was top notch .  i recomend anyone that claims to be a fan of his to check this film out .  i guarantee you will be satisfied
this show is great .  the 5th season was considered so-so by critics but it is truely halarious .  see 'the ski lift' for a classic curb episode
awesome !  bought for my husband for valentine's day !   even our 8 year old son loved it .   excellent condition
i was reading some reviews of  " the quiet man "  earlier this year .  and a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time ,  entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children ,  grandchildren and i imagine great grandchildren .in that league of the timeless you have to put ben-hur ,  a story of love ,  redemtion ,  compassion ,  revenge ,  retribution ,  foregiveness and tranquility ,  in an epic truly larger than life .  if we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago ,  then certainly william wyler's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view .for me ,  seeing it again and again ,  i am always startled by mr .  heston's skills as an actor ,  often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence .  here the antagonist is stephen boyd ,  judah ben-hur's best friend from childhood ,  now addicted to the narcotic of power .  the two will clash ;  this is the time of christ's ministry .  christ is seen as a rabble rouser and rome ,  an international giant the world had never seen ,  seeks to thwart that message by girding up jerusalem .  so they send the now goal oriented and vicious messala to the home of ben-hur .heston is also supported ably by jack hawkins ,  a brilliant actor in his prime ,  as the roman counsel quintus arrius .  judah ben-hur ,  sentenced to virtual death on the roman galleys ,  survives a battle with the macedonians to only save quintus arius .i say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene ,  the arrival of quintus arrius in rome ,  a hero ,  with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman ,  judah ben-hur .  william wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as jack hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before ceasar there must be 100 steps !  and the camera back away to see hawkins in his magenta robe ,  draped over the pure white stairs ,  climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire .  in  " spartacus ,  "  also a fine movie a few years later ,  the script tells you about the size of the roman empire .  here in this one scene ,  wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word .at the same time ,  judah ben-hur ,  remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs ,  looks around and in that one expression on heston's face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century rome ,  he amplifies the scene of hawkins climbing the staircase .a great ,  great move .  well worth your time if you have never seen it .  well worth your time again if you have .  5 stars .  larry scantlebur
if you are interested in computer history and the fight between microsoft and apple still very hot today this is a must have dvd
i have both madonna grimes workouts dvd's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts .   it was a great way to start my day ,  i was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same ,  but with disapointment comes satisfaction .   the other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts ,  and learn a workout that i never thought that i would learn and enjoy doing .   jayna's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning ,   also great moves you can use for other reasons .     rania's upper body is really fun ,  some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot .   suhaila workout i am intimidated by .  i have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it .   i have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks .   she can contract them one at a time .   some mornings i get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape .  they are really fun .  this tape has a bonus yoga ,  i had never tried yoga and this gave me an opportunity to try it .i highly recommeded this dvd/vhs .  i love the 10 minute workouts .   with this dvd/vhs there are no excuses you can always find 10 minutes in a day .
i have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding robert kennedy ,  and i've got to say that this is ,  by far ,  one of the best pieces of work i've yet to see .   the movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience's attention ,  allows for us to actually *feel* what robert kennedy is feeling ,  to sense the tension during chaotic times ,  and most importantly ,  to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for america .this movie is extremely well-balanced ,  provides excellent insight to the inner mind/heart of robert kennedy ,  and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from kennedy's life .if you are looking to pick one movie on robert kennedy - this is it .   this is the one you want to watch .   after watching this ,  you will see robert kennedy in a way you never have before .
this is a great documentary .  alex jones is not a nut ,  just very passionate about the quality  ( or lack )  of our governments .our leaders are swine ,  and so are our neighbors if they continue to be willfully ignorant of these truths .
i'm not going to try to get all the characters names right in yi yi .   and there are a lot of characters ,  an extended family and various lovers and children .   taiwan is a modern ,  impressive city ,  a place rarely seen on american television or film .  i might be looking at manhattan rather than taipei .   the computer engineer's family ,  the wife with spiritual emptiness ,  the teen daughter involved in her first serious sexual activity ,  the grandmother on life support ,  and the eight-year old son teased to exhaustion by little girls ,  they live in a high-rise condominium over a raised superhighway .   then there's the ner-do-well brother-in-law ,  so superstitious that he marries his pregnant wife only on a chinese lucky day .  his old girlfriend shows up at the wedding to raise hell .   she returns at the babies chinese confirmation for more of the same .   a fight breaks out ,  kicking little men and screechy women .our engineer had walked away from a young love ,  and while wife is with the monks ,  he renews the relationship on a business trip to tokyo .   he is in love .   so is she ,  but ,  i can't tell you what happens without giving away this poignant part of the plot .   engineer's daughter is having a rather unusual fling as well .   i've left out a ton of information as this film was close to three hours long ,  but watch the beautiful cinematography of edward yang ,  and his brilliant pacing .   one thinks it is real life .
this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen .   christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies .   this movie is very unique and will never get old
about a young scientist  ( played by charles martin smith )  who goes to the arctic to study wolves ,  their survival ,  and their effect on the caribou herds  ( he proves they are not killing the caribou ,  as it had been assumed )  .  he is a fledgling in the wilds ,  but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves .  he notices the wolves eating mice ,  and begins to do the same himself - a supreme irony in this disney film .  the first half is excellent ,  compelling and beautiful to watch ;  but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a man-as-encroacher bad guy message and a confusing man-as-wolf indian mysticism presentation .  it's wonderfully photographed ,  though ,  and the soundtrack is stunning
if there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides  " saving private ryan ,  "  this is it .the story starts with a lawyer visiting england as a tourist years after war's end .  he discovers a cheap ,  ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value .   " value ?  "  replies the lawyer .   " wrap it very carefully "  he adds .  so begins his mental journey back in time to the english airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th  ( nine ,  eighteenth )  bomb group .this  " hard luck "  group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has  " over-identified "  with his men ,  thus putting them before his missions .  the general ,  frank savage ,  must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit .general savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit .  they turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind ,  or letting down their new leader .   ( each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel piece in the officers' club ,  and turning the head of a ceramic pirate ,  face outward .  )but the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes .  he will always keep the mission first ,  and will not over-identify with his men .  he will not let the loss of his men affect him .or ,  will he ?this black & white story is exceptional and superbly acted .  it shows the mental tug-of-war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect .  it depicts how the ugliness of war brings out the best in ourselves ,  and creates fraternal bonds that last a lifetime .this is not a gory story ,  but it is one that will leave you breathless .  it may sadden you ,  but it will not disappoint you .  it does not end with everyone living ,  or happy .war never does .p . s .  the  " whole nine yards "  refers to the length of ammunition linked together that fed into the machine guns aboard each bomber
according to imdb ,   " moulin rouge "  was shot in 1 . 37 ,  not widescreen .   therefore you're not losing that much to view this in 1 . 33  ( full screen )  format
this movie was alright .   i give it five stars for being artsy ,  quirky .it makes gay love look systematically funny ,  and easily made fun of .   even people with aids deserve a better look at their lives .   i do not have hiv/aids but have lost friends over it .   this is a movie for those who either want a good laugh ,  or a good cry .i know of nobody who really acts as these characters do .   i doubt it goes on in new york citys manhattan either .purchase this if your just wanting to add to your glbt vhs ,  or dvd collection
oh ,  wow .  i can't complain much about this .  although some things i didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed ,  this was still very effective on me .  it may've been better as a game or not ,  i don't know .  there were several times where this made me so emotional i wanted to cry for the characters .  the silent and melancholy kaze ,  the hilarious and deranged cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins .  even for the short time you know them ,  they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching .  i know some people may not be satisfied with this ,  but i was .  i recommend it
i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way .  the direction was fine ,  the actors well chosen ,  the script very good and harrison ford's acting top quality .  i think this film was superior to older ones like  " the hunt for red october "  or  " crimson tide "  whose story was rather flat and predictable .  the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian self-sacrifice
it is a shame that american film classics  (  like l and h )   get more attention and love outside of the us than in it .i just bought the universal laurel and hardy 21 volume box set which is only available in europe from amazon uk  ( region 2 )  .  this set is everything people are saying it is .  it is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films  (  some solo efferts )  and goes though the hal roach features .  all the prints are restored and of pristine quality .  a truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys .  there are some missing films  (  i assume for copyright reasons )  such as babes in toyland ,  the devils brother ,  bonnie scotland and flying deuces .to acomadate these dvds i bought a region free dvd player off amazon , which is the only way to go if you really want to collect .  the dvd player was very cheap .  plays beautfully and  is well worth the investment .  as a side note if you have a region free player all the dvds in the universal box set are also availble as single dics ,  in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films .  if you love laurel and hardy this is the only way to go !  anything to screw hallmark and the corperate monster !  !  why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute half-a prints !  !  !
it's interesting to read some of the other reviews .  i can't understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie .  it's imaginative ,  as was  " nightmare before christmas "  ,  but goes beyond that movie with even better stop-action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving .  i loved  " nightmare "  ,  but corpse bride takes all the things i loved and made them better .  the voices of all the actors ring true .  the mood is gothic and yet comical .  the score is rich and defines the movie perfectly .   ( the dvd allows you to watch the movie with only the music ,  and that's a real plus .  )
wonderful to find in the sale just as my tape was wearing out . delightful movie , well acted by all but especially wonderful performance by bridges as the human/alien hybrid . a superb print too . thanks amazon - you did it again
denzel washington is great but angelina jolie he is even better .  the movie itself is pretty scary ,  to tell you the truth it's not pleasant .  there are some parts you don't really need to see .  the plot of the movie is interesting and keeps you wondering what is gonna happen next .  i recommend watching it with somebody ,  cause it's not pretty .  but it's a good movie .
these dvd's are a joke .  if you want the original full length movies on dvd go on ebay .  you will find versions copied from laserdisc .  they are in widescreen ,  digital quality ,  original audio and full length .  they are superior to the old vhs copies and much better then these new dvd's .viva la revolution .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
the film shows us the reality that is wal-mart ,  many common criticisms ,  and many common misconceptions .   it successfully shows that all of the criticisms against wal-mart are outright lies ,  half-truths ,  distortions of facts ,  or just plain ideological hatred for a successful business .   it shows what the employees go through while on the job and off the job .   it also shows how wal-mart has actually increased america's standard-of-living by allowing the poorest of us to purchase our daily necessities at the lowest price possible and the least-skilled amongst us able to attain high-quality health benefits and a decent wage .wal-mart is not a perfect business ,  and it never will be .   no business is perfect .   unfortunately ,  many people do not ever cope with this fact ,  and don't seem capable of it .   they compare wal-mart to the  " perfect "  business which does not exist ,  and then have the audacity to complain when wal-mart does not fit their non-existant model of perfection
one of the productions of which he is the most proud ,  robert redford's all the president's men should be required viewing  ( and the woodward/bernstein book should be required reading )  for all who aspire to the profession of journalist .   redford was fascinated with the story of two young ,  untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the united states .   redford's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary ,  so he followed as the story developed .   he got to know bob woodward and carl bernstein when they were still at ground level ,  still unsure as to where this would all lead ,  but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics .redford has always been a political animal ,  with a reporter's instinct ,  and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the american political climate .   earlier ,  he and director michael ritchie had made the candidate ,  a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well-meaning of men or women  ( and a film well worth your time )  .     it took two years of hard work to get all the president's men off the ground .   it was turned down by several studios ,  with the excuse that people were tired of watergate ,  but he was finally able to get warner bros .  to say yes ,  provided redford himself would star .dustin hoffman was enlisted to play carl bernstein ,  redford's old friend jason robards won an oscar as washington post editor-in-chief ben bradlee ,  jack warden was cast as editor harry rosenfeld ,  martin balsam was editor howard simons ,  jane alexander was judy hoback ,  bookkeeper to the committee to re-elect the president  ( c . r . e . e . p .  )  ,  ned beatty was martin dardis ,  who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence ,  stephen collins was hugh sloan ,  whose wife debbie  ( played by meredith baxter )  kept his conscience working on the right side ,  robert walden  ( who would go on the the fine television series lou grant )  was dirty trickster donald segretti ,  and hal holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story :   the mysterious deep throat ,  who helped woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall .   of course ,  we now know that deep throat was the fbi's assistant director w .  mark felt ,  an old friend of woodward's and a man torn between his loyalty to the fbi and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings-on .redford asked alan j .  pakula to direct and gordon willis to handle the cinematography ,  and they crafted a look that is part documentary ,  part thriller .   ( if you get a chance ,  also see pakula and willis' the parallax view ,  starring warren beatty .   another outstanding ,  scary political film .  )   william goldman ,  who won an oscar for butch cassidy and the sundance kid ,  wrote the tight ,  exciting screenplay for which he won again  ( this was actually the fourth time redford and goldman had worked together ;  goldman also adapted donald e .  westlake's the hot rock ,  a very funny caper film ,  and the poignant the great waldo pepper ,  which was out for a short time on dvd in pan and scan ,  but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful widescreen splendor .   universal ,  where are you ?  )the efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes all the president's men a smashing success .   it succeeds as an exciting ,  suspenseful procedural ,  as a statement on the neccessity of a free press ,  as a character study ,  and as a great movie-movie .the double-disc dvd set is the one to buy :   the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp ,  clean 1 : 85 aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by redford himself .   the second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film ,  on woodward and bernstein ,  and on deep throat .   there is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film ,  and an interview with jason robards on the dinah shore show .a deserved landmark in film and in journalism ,  all the president's men is a must-see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be ,  a must-own .   in our darkest hour ,  when all seems obfuscated and hopeless ,  it reminds us that light can be brought to bear .   people can make a difference
i don't own this series ,  but i watch it on pbs .  it's great .  they cover a limited number of words per episode ,  and i'm grateful ;  it can get a little overwhelming .  my 2 1/2 year old daughter only does a few signs ,  but she's able to decipher anything i sign to her .  i know  " mama "  ,   " hungry "  ,   " want ,  "   " cookie "  .  .  .  for now that will have to do for  " mama is hungry ,  she wants a cookie .  "  you'll catch other words from the songs .  go to the signing time website .  they have sample videos ,  and lyrics ,  you'll get the idea .  a little at a time is good enough for me .  expert proficiency is not my expectation here .  five stars
i have absolutely no idea how to properly describe this movie .  i just know that i had to buy it b/c i rented it so often .  napolean is such a loser .  his brother kip could have a huge  " l "  on his own forehead .they have a pet llama named tina .  watching this movie brought back all of my akward teen years .  agh !  also made me feel a lot prettier and smarter than i thought i was .  in the end ,  though ,  they all win .  kip is especially transformed ." your mom goes to college .  .  .
the grapes of wrath is a great movie ,  perhaps one of the best i have ever seen .  however ,  having read the book ,  i notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out .  by taking out these crucial ,  yet quiet scenes ;  the movie has a faster pace than the book .in the movie ,  grandpa died suddenly .  the only explanation for his death was that he had a stroke .  in the book ,  the preacher ,  casy ,  explained to the family members that the old man could not leave his land ,  his home and his way of life .  casy explained that grandpa was spiritually dead when he left his house ,  and it did not take long for his body to also die .  this shows the great sacrifice that the joads must make in order to survive .  in the movie ,  it just seems that they pack up ,  leave ,  and arrive ,  without any moral dilemmas .  grandpa dies in another family's tent ,  not just on a blanket by the road .  this is important because in the book it symbolizes the way people have to help one another in times of need .in the scenes in california ,  the pace slows down a bit ,  so i can feel the details of the book surface in the movie .  with the events leading up to casy's death crisp and clear ,  i could understand his death as brutal murder ,  and tom's speech about him carrying on casy's work beautifully taken from the book .  i really loved these scenes ,  because unlike most of the movie ,  these scenes do remain true to the book ,  and because of that ,  they are full of detail ,  and you can see the hand of steinbeck at work .despite all of these forgotten scenes ,  the grapes of wrath is one of the best movies of all time
threshold starring carla gugino  ( special guest catherine bell episode #11 outbreak )  :i loved this show .  i liked it when it was on cbs and i like it even more now that i got the dvd's with the unaired shows to at least try to bring it to some sense of a conclusion .carla gugino was very good  ( as usual ) playing a strong woman named dr .  molley anne caffrey a contingency analayst who's job it is to come up with worst case scenarios for any natural or man-made disaters .   ( earthquake , hurricanes ,  wwiii ,  epidemics ,  worldwide finacial depression )  you get the picture .  the one she is called upon for is for a scenario named  " threshold "   ( hence the name of the show )  .  threshold - is the contengency plan for alien invasion .  her job is now to put the plan in motion .  to quickly assemble a team made up of a physian ,  a mathmatican/linguist ,  an areonautics engineer and navy seal whose job it is to implement the orders she gives out usually via military force or other covert means and to protect the  " red team "  .  and asscess the threat and plan how to stop the threat .the actors who played the other members on molly's team were all good and i believed and cared for them all .  but this review is about carla and catherine so i will get to the point .carla owned the show ,  she carried it off just like she did in  " karen sisco "she told a great story and added importance to a very well done show .  i really do believe she is one of the best and underrated actresses in the business today .  and she was just stunningly beautiful .  every time she was on camera you could not help but to focus on her .  the camera loved her .  the beauty made you look her way .  but the acting ,  the way she carried herself .  made you stay focused on her .catherine bell was on the episode  " outbreak "  this episode was about about how molly and her team discovered that one of the ways the aliens could spread and infect people was through the food supply .  now they already knew this a few episodes before but ,  they thought they took care of it ,  but they were wrong .  molley needed to know exactly how they spread it ,  to what foods and how long did it take effect on people who ate it .  so she basically drafted catherine bell and made her apart of the team whether she wanted to or not .catherine bell played dr .  daphene larsons .  an expert on botony and biology .  who figured out that some foods were more likely to get it and that it was mainly tomatos and food like it that they need to worry about .  i'm afraid catherine did not get much to work with here and she was only on it for that epsiode and only mentioned it the rest .  i was told that had the show been picked up and went the next year she would have been a full blown cast member .but catherine - like carla - was stunningly beautiful .  however she does not have the same presence as carla does when she on camera .  she did a good job - but she had next to nothing to work with and there was no essence within her or her character's personality that took over when you got over her looks as opposed to carla when she was on .  carla was on her game and stayed on it .  it was her show .  catherine did the best she could with what little she had ,  she was not on her game .  but it wasn't her show .carla and catherine had really no interaction together .  the only one they kinda had was when molly was briefing daphene on threshold and the story thus far .  and that was done with daphine sitting in a chair looking confused and over-whelmed while molly stood in front of her and explained it all .  and it was all done using cross fade and fade in-outs edits .  i appreciated the effects - nice touch - but i would have liked to see some real dialogue there .  i'm pretty sure had there been an episode 14 they would have done something together like i don't know ;  kick some alien butt together or kissed .in conclusion - i loved the show .  then tension kept me going and seemed real .it wasn't neardy and though it was scfi ,  i really did'nt get that feeling .  there was more to the story ,  it was intellegently done and i wanted more .  but they cancelled it .  the last epsiode did however give it some closeuer so you don't feel too cheated buying one season of the show .  it left you having enough questions as to where you wanted to see more ,  but ,  could still come up with your own conclusions .  they ended it like they could add more to the story at a later date in a form of a movie or another show but if they never do .  then i guess it is still okay .the show was supposed to last three years going in accordance to molly's scernario :1 .  threshold - we have spotted and accessed the threat .2 .  foothold - they have established themselves on earth .  we have notified the public and began to stop them by any means necessary .   ( probably what season 2 would have been called .3 .  stranglehold - if it get to this point it either means we have stopped them and sent them home or they have won and anhilated us .   ( season three title i suppose .  )she never came up with a 4th stage .  i guess it would be pointless .
if you have never been introduced to thora birch-this is the one to see .   i don't know if this was her first movie or not but she is really young in this film .  if there were ever a star born  " this is it "  .  she is just unbelievable .   griffin and johnson are really great too .   this movie is actually worth watching for the scene location alone
ferris bueller  ( matthew broderick )  is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there .  he's the kind of guy whom we all want to be ,  really .  he acts like he doesn't have a care in the world ,  and lives life to fullest .  the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye  ( alan ruck )  ,  a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris .  in this film ,  ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another  " sick "  day for him ,  his ninth to be exact .  in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick ,  he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process .  another antithesis of ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister jeannie ( jennifer grey )  who suspects something is up ,  as does the sly-but-not-so-slick dean of students ,  ed rooney  ( jeffrey jones )  .it's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen for instance ,  ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days .  it's amazing ;  people ,  like his parents who are most easily duped ,  would think that this one sick kid when in reality ,  he's having a ball .  however ,  knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate ,  he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile .  ferris and cameron bail out ferris' girl sloane  ( mia sara )  with a dead grandmother ploy ,  and together the trio spend the day doing the town in chicago driving the '61 gt convertible  ( oh ,  yeah !  )  .  this movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time .  it's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life .  for after all ,  as our hero says :   " life moves pretty fast ;  if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while ,  you might miss it .  "  that's the moral of the story ,  really ." bueller .  .  . bueller .  .  . bueller ?  "  not here ,  but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life ,  and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day
i am a very avid  " star trek "   fan ,  and find the dvd's very worthwhile and interesting .   (  my star trek interests go back to the original series with william shatner ,  leonard nimoy ,   jamesdoohan ,  et .  al .
lady and the trap has been an enduring disney classic for 50 years now and it's amazing how well it holds up after all that time .   the hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch .   this film is an example of disney animation at its classic best .but calling lady and the tramp a great animated film is really selling it short .   it's a great movie ,  period .   lady's idyllic life is shattered and bad boy tramp comes to her rescue .   while he begins his relationship with lady in the dog house  ( sorry ,  couldn't resist )  ,  he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end .   if you've seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you'll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans .   watch lady and the tramp and you'll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years .
love this dvd .  i loved the live performance at the mtv awards .she has my vote
while i've always loved blade runner ,  the so-called  " theatrical cut "  was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation .   harrison ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped .   but hollywood ,  in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience's intelligence and artistic sensitivity ,  stuck with it anyway ,  on the assumption that we needed to be spoon-fed with sophomoric incompetence .equally stupid ,  though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted ,  was the inappropriate sappy ending ,  which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well .   it didn't even make any sense :  the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars .   but hollywood ,  with characteristic cowardice ,  trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience .   rick deckard's fate at the end of the director's cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982 ,  and the subsequent vhs audience .   it reminds me of what orion pictures did to george romero's monkeyshines .   ( since when does a romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots ?  )   or how about the  " happy ending "  grotesquely grafted onto terry gilliam's brazil ?the extra footage between deckard and rachael ,  while not extensive ,  enriches the characterizations ,  however modestly ,  and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end .   the only thing i regret is that the extra bloody footage - in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes - found on the old vhs tape was not included in the director's cut .   which means that this is not fully the director's cut :  the material was left out to garner the sacred ,  almighty  " r "  rating upon the film's re-release ,  as it was the first time around .   one would think it would have been restored on dvd ,  but warner ,  with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude ,  decided against it .   they probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that ridley scott would have wanted it that way .   can anyone say  " eyes wide shut "  ?the fact that there are viewers course enough to value the  " theatrical cut "  and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all .    and  " definitive "  the director's cut is :  despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage ,  there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again ,  by anyone .
i watched this movie in health class during a unit on ageing .   the movies was very touching ,  and turned the whole class to tears .   but ,  it was a great movie that was very touching ,  and i would suggest watching it
tcm iii was a good movie . it had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie . it lacked the essential characters , though . it would've done better if they had brought chop top or drayton back to life . the film is about two friends headed down to florida from texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies . we already know it was leatherface , and the two drive on . the next day , they come upon a gas station , where a crazy , yet funny gas station attendant named alfredo work . also making his appearance here as well is viggo mortenson as tex , a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance . the two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods , pursued by the evr vigialnt leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw . it gets the job done every time . as in the texas chainsaw tradition , they are captured and prepared for dinner . one of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on leatherface with the help of an veteran they met along the way . it's an overall good movie and i loved it
first of all ,  i have lost count of the ammount of times i have seen this movie but every time i watch it i get goose bumps .  this is how affective the movie is .george c .  scott  ( of  " patton "  fame )  plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy .  soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and mr .  scott begins to investige the house's history .  this is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film .this movie is all about atmosphere .  there are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays .  this film does not need to gross the viewer out .  the changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters .  you are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease .  there is nothing  " in your face "  about the scares .this film is for fans of the 1960's film  " the haunting "  or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story .  don't even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and i guarantee you'll watch it more than once .  i have recommended it to many people and i never heard a negative comment .  for the full effect ,  wait until night to watch it and then watch it alone .  see how many times you glance over your shoulder .
this is the best animal movie i have ever seen .  . from a child's point of view .  this has been our daughter's favorite movie for the last one year or so  ( she's 3 now )  and after watching it almost every day  ( sometimes several times a day )  she still enjoys it as much !  we're surprised that even we are not tired of it .  the animals are fun to watch ,  the story is interesting and the music is great .  we've bought several other animal movies for our daughter and this surpasses all of them .  the production is superb ,  the animals did a great job and it all seems so real .   a must-by for everyone who has small kids
it is a wonderful complement to my lucy collection .  the tango scene is some of her best physical comedy !  !
liam neeson was wonderful to watch - a tragic love story with great winter scenery and lots of cold breath shots .   however ,  patricia arquette was too teenage giggly - not a terrific actress in this film ,  at least .   still ,  a great role for neeson
spider-man 2 is better than the original spider-man .  i feel i should get that out of the way first ,  since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one .  however ,  i feel spider-man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade spider-man ,  it should naturally be better .  that's what this sequel feels like ,  a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there .  it's a good film ,  but it's not really the way i thought a sequel should be .effects are even better than the first ,  and the tentacles of doc ock make for some truly spectacular battles ,  including a centerpiece on a runaway train .  tobey maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of peter parker ,  and has good chemistry with kirsten dunst as mary jane .  alfred molina has more to work with as doc ock than dafoe did as the goblin ,  and humanizes what was once a wacky villain .  james franco continues to develop harry osborn well ,  and the supporting cast like jk simmons and rosemary harris fill out the high-caliber acting .but the script needs work .  it uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot ,  that of the hero calling it quits .  it's never convincing ,  and the film drags as we wait for peter to realize things we've known all along .  character relationships ,  though well-acted ,  don't seem to have progressed since the first movie .  we're still treading the peter/mary jane love triangle ,  just with a different third wheel .  harry still has his on/off friendship with peter .  there are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end ,  but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one .  for a story supposedly set 3 years later ,  it might as well have been 3 days .we get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation .  i enjoy spider-man 2 on its own ,  and it's nice to have it in my dvd library ,  but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me .  hopefully next year's spider-man 3 will fix that .
i loved the the fact the whole family can watch it
i thought this was a wonderful dvd because of the following factors :*the goal of this billy blank's dvd is to get kids off their feet and exercising .   in this day and age of television ,  video games ,  and a joke of physical education in schools ,  it's up to parents to stress the importance of regular fitness activity .*the diversity is great .   the children on this dvd consist of both boys and girls ,  ages of about 5 to maybe 12 or 13 years old ,  all sizes from thin to slightly chubby ,  and different nationalities .*billy blanks is just a very good instructor and you can see why he's loved by young and old .   he motivates the kids and makes the moves entertaining for them ,  even throwing in a couple of old dance moves .   : - )   billy blanks speaks from the heart and you can tell that he honestly wants everyone to be fit .as far as the fitness level ,  i could see kids doing this but it gets a little trickier when you get to the floor exercises if you haven't exercised in a while .   the good thing about this particular dvd is since it's geared towards kids ,  billy places less emphasis on getting moves perfect ,  his main focus is to get the kids to realize that exercise is fun .overall ,  i think this is a great dvd to add to your collection .   it's something you and your kids can enjoy doing together .
the legend of zelda :  complete animated series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children's cartoon should be ,  right there with  " teenage mutant ninja turtles ,  "   " street sharks ,  "  and  " recess .  "  the legend of zelda was  ( and still is )  such an exceptional video game series for all ages ,  and the tv show followed in its footsteps .  it combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy one-liners ,  and some jokes that still today make me laugh .   " lookin' good ,  princess !  'specially from this angle !  "  as children we see link yell that to zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences .  but later ,  that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee ,  and wonder how we ever missed it before .but the series is most enjoyable for those of us who faithfully stuck to the actual video game series .  the implimentation of original 8-bit sound effects into the cartoon is an added bonus that draws us back for more .  and waiting to see which classic zelda enemy will cause link and zelda trouble next is just that much more fun  ( especially if you can name them )  .but by far the most fun thing about this show is waiting and praying for the day when link can coax a kiss out of the lovely princess .  and they've come so close it almost made me angry when they got interrupted .  link tries so hard ,  and makes such an idiot out of himself trying ,  that you'd think he deserves a little action once in a while .  but every time ,  no matter how he tries ,  he either messes up or is interrupted by ganon's non-stop attempts to steal the triforce .all in all ,  if you grew up with te super mario super show ,  and you're a nintendo fan ,  you'll appreciate this show as much as you love to watch it
some classic episodes indeed .   all in the family broke new ground in television sitcoms .   the world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households .   archie bunker's old fashioned values were being challenged .   it is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced archie bunker's views were .   organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood ?   not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion ?  quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone .certainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970's .   carol o'connor ,  jean stapelton ,  sally struthers ,  and rob reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times .   all in the family spawned off may other great shows such as the jeffersons ,  maude ,  and indirectly good times .   this first season was certainly a reverred one .   just look at it with an open mind
as usual with a bruce willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was .  interesting high-tech house and mostly believable small-town villains who are the hostage-takers .  the underlying story of the rich dad & his swindles detracted from it i think
the incredibles is a first-class animated film about a superhero and his family who are forced to seek the anonymity of a government witness protection program to escape a rash of lawsuits orchestrated by their enemies .  mr .  incredible has to endure the boredom of a job as an insurance claims specialist while his wife and children cooperate by also concealing their extraordinary powers in front of others .  this is hardest on the children as they play with youngsters at school and on the athletic field .  eventually ,  mr .  incredible is lured out of retirement on a ruse by a former foe .  by now mr .  incredible is older and fatter but he still proves equal to the challenge .  the rest of the movie is filled with excitement and comical moments as mr .  incredible finds himself in a tight spot from which only his family can rescue him .  the cast is headed by craig t .  nelson and holly hunter .  ms .  hunter supplies the voice for elastigirl who is also the wife of mr .  incredible .the incredibles was nominated for an academy award for best achievement in sound and best writing ,  screenplay written directly for the screen .  oscars were won for best animated feature film of the year and best achievement in sound editing .  in addition ,  the incredibles won the new york film critics circle award for best animated film
this is a great dvd about cage matches .  it has a lot of violent matches on it and a lot of classic cage matches .  but the reason why i i am giving this 4 stars is because most of the matches on here are jips .  ( matches joined in progress .  )  it would have been better if all the matches were full .  but on disc 2 it has 7 full matches but that is still no enough matches .  this dvd is worth a buy but remeber only 7 matches are full
okay .  .  . when i heard about the brat pack movie and music collection i was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of the high school reunion collection which was released several years ago .   both sets were released by universal .   fear not ,  i am here to tell you about the differences .   the first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies .   like it's closest cousin the high school reunion collection ,  the brat pack movie and music collection includes the exact same movies- " the breakfast club ,  "   " sixteen candles "  and weird science .  "   the cover art on the dvd's is the same ,  no new bonus material with each film that i detected .it has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off .   no one even really pegged this acting group  " the brat pack ,  "  until around 1985 .   molly ringwald was one of the best known brat pack members and  " sixteen candles "  helped to start the whole brat pack phenom but no one ever considered  " weird science "  a brat pack movie .  trust me ,  i remember the 80's .   it always seemed like it would make more sense to include  " st elmo's fire "  or  " pretty in pink "  in with this set .   this is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included .the music cd includes the following songs- " true "  by spandau ballet ,   " tenderness "  by general public ,   " if you leave "  by omd ,   " weird science ,  "  by oingo boingo ,   " oh yeah "  by yello  ( which was in  " ferris bueller's day off "  ,  pretty in pink by the psychedelic furs ,   " don't you forget about me ,  "  by simple minds and  " i go crazy "  by flesh for lulu .why include music from  " pretty in pink "  and not include the movie ?   on to the packaging .   the packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning .   i own over 100 tv on dvd and box  sets and nothing is like this .   the dvd's are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the dvd's are in sleeves instead of jewel cases .  on the back page of the binder is a pop quiz .for the most part it is very similar to the highschool reunion collection but it's nice to have the bonus cd and the cool packaging .   however ,  it would have been nice if universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection .  one must assume they must not own the rights to  " pretty in pink "   ( it's listed as a parmount dvd )  because that is easily one of the best known brat pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term brat pack associated with it .
in some of fred astaire's movies there's only one excellent reason to watch ,  and that's to watch fred astaire .  in you were never lovelier there are three other excellent reasons .  rita hayworth .  jerome kern .  johnny mercer .  the four of them have concocted a romantic and funny south american fable that features some great dancing by both astaire and hayworth and some memorable songs by kern and mercer .eduardo acuna  ( adolphe menjou )  ,  a wealthy buenos aires businessman ,  has four beautiful daughters ,  and in the acuna family they must marry in age order .  the eldest fulfills her responsibilities and the two youngest have beaus they're now anxious to share vows with .  but the second eldest ,  maria  ( rita hayworth )  is in no hurry .  she wants romance and charm and the men she meets are just panting boys .  then she sees robert davis  ( fred astaire )  ,  a very charming ,  down-on-his-luck dancer ,  singing dearly beloved at her elder sister's wedding .  he tries to chat her up ;  she stares him down .  then the plot intervenes .  before long she knows what she wants .  robert knows what he wants .  eduardo acuna knows what he doesn't want .  .  . a down-on-his-luck dancer in the family .  from then on it's songs ,  dances ,  romance and misunderstandings ,  which moves into songs ,  dances and romance .  the plot feels sluggish at times and there's way too much xavier cugat and his orchestra ,  but astaire and hayworth are at their peak ,  kern has written some memorable melodies and few could top mercer at lyric writing ,  none in hollywood .hayworth not only was a gorgeous creature ,  she was a gifted dancer ;  many think she was the best astaire worked with .  technically ,  she not only handled the steps astaire created ,  she did so without a hint of effort .  after you've watched the dances a couple of times ,  go back and watch again ,  but this time concentrate on her face and her hand and arm action .  she gives every indication of being utterly relaxed and enjoying herself ,  even in the fast tap routines .  she seems naturally to find the most graceful attitude for an extended arm ,  a turn of her head ,  a raised hand .  she may not be quite as good as astaire ,  but she's good enough .among the stand-out routines are :--the audition dance .  robert shows up at acuna's office and demands a chance to show his stuff as a dancer .  from there astaire takes off on a fast tap routine that takes him all over the floor ,  onto acuna's desk ,  the sofa and chairs .  he works into the dance a cane ,  a rug ,  the drapes and acuna's head .--i'm old fashioned .  this is probably the best romantic wooing dance astaire did .  it's all fluid motion and spontaneous recognition ,  danced on the elegant ,  polished outdoor landing of acuna's mansion .  rita hayworth is a vision ,  and matches him step for step .  we move from maria declaring with humor and assurance that robert's the man for her ,  to robert's protestation that he's just a guy from omaha ,  nebraska ,  to the dance that brings them closer and closer together until we know through the dance that a love match has just happened .  the funny exit through the doors and back into the living-room ,  bumping into each other ,  each giving way ,  bumping again and then going in together arm in arm hits just the right note .  the dance works so well in part because kern and mercer came up with a classic :i'm old fashioned ,i love the moonlight ,i love the old fashioned things .the sound of rainupon a window pane ,the starry song that april sings .this year's fanciesare passing fanciesbut sighing sighs ,  holding hands ,these my heart understands .i'm old fashionedbut i don't mind it .that's how i want to be ,as long as you agree ,to stay old fashioned with me .--the shorty george .  this fast tap routine starts out with maria visiting robert at a rehearsal .  he sings the shorty george and she takes a couple of lines .  he looks surprised that she knows the song .  he starts to dance and invites her to join him .  hayworth stays right with astaire and looks like she's having the time of her life .--you were never lovelier .  robert declares his feelings for maria ,  but more misunderstandings occur .  finally ,  everything is resolved .  robert shakes off some knight's armor he was wearing  ( there is sort of a reason )  and appears below maria's bedroom window in black tie .  she rushes down .  .  . and off they go dancing while all the members of the acuna family look on approvingly .  and the johnny mercer lyrics and jerome kern music brings us to the happy end :you were never lovelier ,  you were never so fair ;dreams were never lovelier ,pardon me if i stare .down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face ;i can only say they chose the proper place .you were never lovelier ,  and to coin a new phrase ,i was never luckierin my palmiest days .make a note ,  and you can quote me ,  honor bright ,you were never lovelier than you are tonight
this is ,  as most critics agreed ,  the best of the trilogy .   abrams' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish ,  including a few twists along the way .   i was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film .the only thing i didn't like .  .  .  .  the short pause in the middle of the film ,  probably for a change between the dual layers .   very annoying !
the series was always delightful because it was fun ,  done with panache and done with a little tongue in cheek .  pierce brosnan was great and stephanie zimbalist was a wonderful partner .  loved 'em both .  nice to be able to see it again because i enjoyed it so much and because there is nothing on tv like it today .
i really liked this dvd .  .  . has a lot of information and covered a lot of their important games .  the special features are interesting ,  as well
i wanted to see a movie one evening ,  and it really didn't matter what movie ,  i just wanted to get out of the house ,  and get to a theater .  i looked at the listings and decided to see  " in good company "  ,  and i'm certainly glad i did .  i found this movie to be very entertaining ,  and very enjoyable to watch .  i thought this movie really showed a new edge to scarlett johansson as well .in a way this movie was also an eye-opener on todays' corporate america ,  and its' all too often pitfalls .  nicely produced ,  acted ,  and directed .
what's not to like about the character of jack ryan ?   he's honest ,  ethical ,  modest ,  smart and rising like a shooting star in the us government .   wish he was real .these are all good movies - well made ,  realistic ,  exciting and family friendly
if you don't own this dvd you need to add it to your collection .  in my opinion it is the best american animated film ever released
i wouldn't write yet another review of war and peace if i didn't have something new to say about it ,  namely ,  war and peace and war by peter turchin .  near the end of turchin's book ,  about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires ,  he quotes extensively from the parts of tolstoy's war and peace .  tolstoy ,  with his ratio analysis of various napoleon grand arme metrics to russian army metrics ,  was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time .  pick up turchin's deep book ,  and afterwards read war and peace ,  paying particular attention to turchin's and tolstoy's ideas .  you will never see historical dynamics the same again .sincerely ,alex alanizps--read the book--the movie isn't so good--and please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book :  beyond future shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with middle age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients
this documentary gives a brief introduction to al-jazeera ,  which ,  if you didn't know already ,  is the main arab language newschannel .  it is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it's willingness to go where other ,  stated-owned and controlled arab networks won't tread .  in this sense it is more than a mere arab cnn in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media .the filmmakers here interview al-jazeera personel ,  as well as some american journalists ,  and the american official which liases with al-jazeera for centcom ,  the american central command in the present irak war  ( which happens to be 30 miles from al jazeera headquarters )  .  it covers the timeline from just before the war ,  to just after bush anounced main millitary operations to be over .by striving to be neutral ,  the documentary allows you to see how al-jazeera see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world .  they are very disappointed in the united states ,  but adhere strongly to its values .also interesting is how being  " on the arab side "  gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values ,  like when they are angered by pentagon protests at their having showed images of us prisoners ,  when western media routinely show iraki pows .an unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be .  the american liaison doesn't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source ,  and as if that weren't enough ,  he is barely articulate in english and clearly doesn't know anything about the local context and history .  another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials ,  but doesn't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists ,  irritating the very people they are trying to win over .all in all it's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds .  it gets four stars rather than five because of it's sometimes amateurish handling of flow ,  which makes it at times a bit unfocused
this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema ,  and it made a strong impression on me .  the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me .  i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective ,  although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done .  watching it many years later ,  i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70's cheese that you see in many films from that era .  the carpet and some of the clothes were funny ,  but it didn't detract from the film .  glad i bought it
i thought this dvd set was halarious !   i was hoping it wouldn't be the case where i saw it before ,  and remembered it to be funnier than it really was .   but that was not the case .   it truely was one of the funniest seasons of a comedy show i've ever seen !i wonder if the cast has some sort of deal with sprite ,  though ,  because you see so many current and former cast members from this show ,  in those commercials for sprite .anyone care to comment on this ?my favorite skits are probably the movie satires ,  and the one with michael jackson doing an infomercial is halarious !   i also like the rap video ,  with ice cube in prison ,  doing a song about acting ,  etc .   just phenomenally halarious !mc white said :   check it out !  !
this is a great video collection of her past videos .  i love it .  from the sweet 'i wanna love you forever' to the record label controlled image of 'irrisistible' and 'a little bit' i love the 'a little bit' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop .  but overall this dvd is awesome .  i like the footage from the dream chaser tour and the biography stuff .  this is the best dvd before jennifer lopez's the reel me .
a must-have for all kate rusby fans .   this beautifully-produced concert video is a pure winner ,  showcasing rusby and her band at their best ,  before an adoring ,  appreciative english audience .   several things are worth pointing out :  first ,  what a delight to see how friendly and down-to-earth she is ,  and what a fine performer .   authoritative ,  yet not stuffy or standoffish in any way ,  she presents these old trad ballads in a way that makes them seem like the most immediate and compelling of contemporary art .  .  .  and ,  of course ,  the music is simply stunning -- the band plays sweet ,  but keeps things simple ;  it's warm and modern without muddling down in crossover pretensions ,  it's just simply lovely ,  lovely acoustic music .   finally ,  there's the experience of seeing rusby sing :  is it possible such a perfect sound is coming out of that everyday-looking lass before you ?   guess so .   now i'll have to redouble my efforts to see her when she plays live at a venue near me .  .  .  i know it'll be a night to remember
waiting was a pleasant surprise .it's certainly filled with crude humor ,  but it manages to be funny anyhow .  my first job was in a restaurant much like shenaniganz and perhaps that's why i found the movie so worth watching .the game the employees play is over the top ,  but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on .  if you're a rude anus of a customer ,  don't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks won't mess with your food - they will .  it pays to be polite and tip well ,  especially if you are a regular .chi mcbride's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great ,  and i thought luis guzman did a great job as raddimus .all in all ,  based on personal experience ,  the movie wasn't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical golden corral or ryan's steak house .  sure ,  the characters are over the top ,  but they are based on people just like some i've known .if you're offended by frontal male and female nudity or crass sex jokes you won't want to see this movie
on december 14 ,  1944 ,  as american troops under general douglas macarthur slowly advanced toward the island of luzon ,  japanese guards at the puerto princesa prison camp on palawan committed a terrible act .  herding their allied war prisoners into trenches ,  they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive .utah native eugene nielsen ,  private first class in the 59th coast artillery ,  was one of the few who escaped .  filipino guerrillas transported the survivors to the island of morotai ,  where nielsen described his experience to an army intelligence officer .  news of the massacre reached the pows at cabanatuan ,  as well ,  and prompted the u . s .  army to embark on one of the war's most dramatic missions -- the bataan
this is a fantastic keith urban video .   my favorites would undoubtedly be  " somebody like you ,  "  and  " raining on sunday .  "  i wondered why keith wasn't barefooted in the  " where the blacktop ends "  video  :  )  even so it's a great dvd worth adding to your collection !  my only disappointment was that there wasn't a video of  " you'll think of me .
" cinderella ii :  dreams come true "  is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original cinderella and a few new ones .  the animation is amazing --- it's filled with lush color  ( except for muted color when the story calls for it )  and the animation looks very polished .  it's really a sight to see .the three stories in this are called ,  according to the closing credits ---  " aim to please ,  "   " tall tail "  and  " an uncommon romance .  "  these stories are all tied together with the idea that the fairy godmother is helping the mice to make a storybook about the adventures of them and cinderella since the time that cinderella met the prince .  the very first story finds cinderella arriving at the castle after her honeymoon .  the prince is forced to rush away on important state business and cinderella is left in charge of the royal banquet/ball .  she has no idea what she's supposed to do and so this woman named prudence is assigned to help her out .  but will cinderella be able to pull this together in time and in a way that will please the king ?the second story ,   " a tall tail "  finds cinderella in preparation for the spring festival .  jaq wants to help out ,  but it seems like cinderella no longer has any time for him .  he makes a wish to become human .the final story contains the surprising premise that cinderella's stepsister anastasia is falling in love with a breadmaker at market .  the evil stepmother forbids this romance ,  but cinderella decides to show anastasia that even she can have a dream come true .the voice talent is amazing .  they did a great job of casting people who made the voices sound just like the original film .  unless you're really listening hard ,  you'll be hard-put to notice any difference at all .the music in this film is a combination of themes from the original and a few new songs performed by brooke allison .  i'd never heard anything by brooke allison before  ( that i know of )  ,  but she's an amazing artist .  perhaps the most surprising piece is the closing credits number  ( also featured as a music video )  --- a techno version of  " bibbidi bobbidi boo "  called  " put it together .  "  it works quite well .  another great song is  " follow your heart .  "for a disney sequel ,  this dvd also has some nice special features .  there's the aforementioned music video ,  which features entirely of clips from the film ,  rather than the recording session by brooke allison .  however ,  you do get to see some of the recording in the musical magical featurette ,  which also includes an examination of the film's score by the composer .  there's a cinderella storybook ,  which allows you to read a story about jaq and mary with or without narration .  the enchanted castle game is fairly simple ,  but not too bad --- you get to help with the decoration and cleanup of cinderella's castle ,  preparing a meal and dressing cinderella .  there's also a dvd-rom game called cinderella's dollhouse .  finally ,  of course ,  this dvd has the usual previews/trailers for other movies ,  but perhaps not so usual .  this is a great set of trailers .  there's a promo for the  " beauty and the beast "  special edition dvd in which they talk about how they inserted  " human again "  into the film .  also including in this set is a neat disney dvd  " pure digital magic "  promo that i had never seen before .this dvd is truly a worthy edition to the disney cinderella story .  it really has everything you could want from a sequel to this film and doesn't ruin the original story in any way
a great behind-the-scenes look at decisions that shaped history - and nearly killed all of us .cross-reference this with the more recent kennedy biographies for a wider ,  sobering context .this is the sort of thing that the bush administration should have watched before deciding to invade iraq .
often overlooked ,  robert altman's 'the long goodbye' is arguably one of the films exemplifying the 1970s and ,  although far less dark ,  ranks alongside antonioni's 'the passenger' .propelling marlowe into the opulent ,  'promise' of the west coast 1970s usa ,  altman allows the story to unfold around a classic murder ,  mystery story and the stunning cast help to create an atmosphere of parochial 'goings-on' that can subsequently be seen in the works of david lynch ,  tarrantino and ,  more recently ,  the 'sopranos' .   the late ,  great sterling hayden gives an unforgetable ,  bullying ,  volatile king lear-like performance as the ageing ,  impotent ,  alcoholic writer ,  and mark rydell's 'dangerous' violent character anticipates that which martin scorsese and joe pesci create latterly in goodfellas/casino .  moreover ,  there's an uncredited cameo appearance of a moustachioed arnold  ( schwarzenneger )  as a 'heavy' .however its elliiot's gould's brilliant  ( oscar deserving )  performance as philip marlowe that helps to  seal this film's status into the canon of great films .gould creates a sharp ,  amiable ,  chain-smoking ,  wise-cracking 70s detective whose 'quirky-alone' livestyle allow him the freedom to give his own chandleresque ,  talking-to-himself dialogue  (  .  .  . 'it's alright by me .  .  . ' )  whilst interacting with a diverse range of characters within the narrative .  with respect to this ,  there's the continual variation of the haunting melody ,  'the long goodbye' that is re-worked throughout the film thus floating the narrative structure within changing and moving events and themes yet anchoring it to the overall thread of the story itself .altman's direction is that of a genius at work :  the back-drop of the oceanic tug and wash of the tide as seen through the windows of the seductive though manipulative eilleen wade's windows  ( nina van pallandt )  ,  together with slightly surreal and erotic appartment  setting of marlowe's flat make this film unforgetable .  there's also the tension associated with the 'journeys' to mexico :  a theme used in more recent  ( great )  films including 'lone star' ;  'traffic' ;  and ,  'the three burials of melquiades  estrada' .  who can deny the impact of the opening 'cat' scene and the final 'chapter' of the film  set within the avenue of trees ;  the 'oh-too-late' figure of eileen wade heading in the opposite direction to marlowe who ironically celebrates his parochial sense of closure by playing the minature harmonica .if ever a film rated as a '6' for special merit and sheer enjoyment then this is one of the elite few deserving of such an award !  i urge you to watch or re-watch this film and savour a work of pure genius .  as a commentator and fan of such a seminal film ,  i can only hope that robert altman and-or elliot gould can provide a commentary-enhanced  ( criterion edition  ) dvd
i bought a balance ball kit from another location ,  but wanted a more complete workout than the sampler that came with the kit .   i like the workout a lot and i think it will be a good strengthening and toning tool .   i like that there is a separate relaxation workout for stress relief and i like that the workout cycles through the different body parts
i'm a colin firth fan ,  but that's not the only reason this movie was a great ride .  .  .  it's because it is a great ride .   just enjoy .  .  . you will find yourself in stitches .   the contrast between new england dry humor and brit dry humor .  .  . // it's just too funny .   oliver ,  colin you guys are the best !  !  !
i did not have many expectations when this came out as a movie but was pleasantly surprised !  the dvd was a must own as soon as it came out
this definitely is one of the best movies to own !  !  if you haven't seen it yet ,  you should .  .  .  if you've seen the movie  " blood in ,  blood out "  ,  then you should definitely see this one .  .  .  if you haven't seen either one ,  then i reccommend you buying them both as a combo pack or separately  ( if you want to save $$ )  .  .  .i don't know which one i love more out of the two ,  because i know i've watched each movie more then 30 times .  .  .  both movies are pretty similar to each other .  .  .  but  " blood in ,  blood out "  kinda focuses on the 3 brothers ,  and the paths each of them takes ,  where as  " american me "  focuses on the paths of the main characters in this movie  ( like santana ,  puppet ,  lil' puppet ,  etc )  .  .  but not only does it show their lifestyles ,  but it also focuses on how its having an effect on their families ,  and how their families feel about the life that their kids are leading .  .  .   " american me "  i think involves more of the family in this picture and culture  ( la raza )  then  " blood in ,  blood out "  does .  .  .  it also shows its origin ,  like the pachuco's  ( zoot suit's ,  zoot suit riots )  .  .  this movie is pretty close to 5 stars in my book .  .  .  to me i think it definitely is 1/2 star better then  " blood in ,  blood out "  .  .  . becuase this one seems to have alot more of a story line to it ,  and more characters its focusing on .  .  .  both in and outside the prison walls .  .if you're not sure about owning it ,  rent it first .  .  .  but i can pretty much guarantee that you'll eventually end up owning it
i agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say baby einstein videos ,  however ,  i still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay .  my two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although i agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland .   i love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the dvd .  my son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days .  the video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development .  hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing .
i really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work .  i'm a photographer but not this line of work .  it was an interesting glimpse into their lives .  i wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries ,  personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting .  some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it .
jude is a very powerful film .  it is also very disturbing ,  but it is absolutely a must see .  this is an adaptation of thomas hardy's last novel ,  the film isn't exactly like the novel ,  but if you can ignore that then you'll find that this is quite a terrific film .  just don't expect exactly what you got from the novel .  over all i give it four stars .
i became interested in this movie after reading the book  " ishmael "  by daniel quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book .  it was a very good movie and anthony hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from  " ishmael "  there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization .  there was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization -  " takers "  are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don't know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it .  heck ,  the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees .  but of course that was the main point of  " ishmael "  .  if we don't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature ,  then nature has had it and so have we
the thing i like about this movie was that it was wholesome ,  something the whole family could watch together without having to worry about bleeping the bad parts out !   cute ,  entertaining story with some romance thrown in for interest
most of this movie is terrible ,  but who's complaining ?   the epically long  " begin the beguine "  is the climax of the movie & it makes the whole mess worthwhile .   the last 11 minutes of this movie are mind-blowingly great -- absolute perfection .   the sets ,  the cinematography ,  the costumes ,  the orchestrations & the extraordinary routine itself -- everything combines to make  " begin the beguine "  the most ravishing ,  glamorous black & white production number ever put on film .   it's hollywood at its apogee ,  the quintessence of silver screen glamor .a few of the other numbers are fun :  the first ,   " don't monkey with broadway "  is clever & pleasant ;  later on ,  fred astaire's lovely  " i've got my eyes on you "  is also winning :   a charming routine that he dances to a delightful ,  cheerful orchestration .   some other numbers are worth seeing ,  as well ,  but  " begin the beguine "  outshines everything else in this picture .in between the numbers ,  there's a lot of dreary silliness afoot .   happily ,  dvd technology makes it easy to skip over the dross & go straight for the gold .eleanor powell was a very odd actress .   she was rather pretty & decidedly perky  ( how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality )  ;  she was also quite feminine .   why ,  then ,  does she speak out of the side of her mouth like a gangster ?   she often sounds like a distaff edward g .  robinson  (  " dat was swell ,  johnny ,  swell !  nyah !  "  )  .   but man oh man ,  could she dance !
that special team is gone ,  those players have mostly moved on ,  but  " we'll always have 2004 "  .   great way to relive the fun ,  the hope and the victories .   for every diehard fan .
wow this a great series .   have to strongly recommend it .  .  .  .  yep .  .  has the feel of sienfeld with over the top humor .   clever ,  awkward ,  somewhat vulgar .excellent .
a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy .  director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation  ( many called it a  " ripoff "  )  with this film and the 2 . 35 : 1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work  ( and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-tv tapes )  .the downside of the movie ,  at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard ,  is the general sleaziness of all the characters ,  including the policeman played by a pre-nypd dennis franz  ( who has hair here !  )  .the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit ,  even 25 years after its release .  the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson  ( if that is really her on the closeups )  and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies .there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder .  the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is ,  it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through ,  particularly for males ogling the naked women .
hector elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill .   aside from his superlative work as a doctor on  " chicago hope "  he has been often cast as a sideman in films - the trusted aide ,  the sympathetic boss - but often in supporting roles .   in  " tortilla soup "  he takes the leading role in a mexican-american remake of ang lee's  " eat drink man woman "  .he plays martin naranjo ,  a mexican chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist .   the movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared ,  then eaten ,  that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen .   martin is has lost much of his sense of taste ,  which he thinks is a cruel irony ,  but his cuban partner reminds him that beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing .   martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago .   elizabeth pena is leticia ,  the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple  " grace "  into mini-sermons .   jacqueline obradors is the saucy carmen ,  who was encouraged to get her mba by martin ,  but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion - as her father did with his wondrous cooking .   tamara mello is the youngest maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to  " find herself "  .   constance marie is family friend yolando ,  who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who martin dotes on .   raquel welch is yolando's mother ,  hortensia ,  who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished martin .the film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions .   at the beginning of the film all of the characters are single .   by the end they've all been paired off in one manner or another ,  some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others .   raquel welch is a bit of a distraction in the film .   at age 61 she has a show-stopping beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25 .   in a film full of attractive performers she doesn't  " look her age "  enough to blend into the story .   she plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester .the movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and i would recommend it if only to watch hector elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen .
i was pleasantly surprised by this movie .  the sex scenes were some of the best i've seen because they were graphic yet very realistic .  the story was touching and honest .  if you're an adult who enjoys a realistic story that is very hot ,  you will definitely enjoy this gem .  watch and enjoy
my favorite dvds are concerts ,  festivals ,  unplugged etc .  i was going to buy the cd and amazon pointed me to their dvd .  i prefer dvd surround sound to cd stereo .  plus you get something to look at .  i heard the demon days songs on the radio ,  and liked them alot .  this is an excellent dvd .  you may want to check out bonnaroo ,  cross roads ,  string cheese ,  even the doobie bros .  oh yeah and eric burdon and the new animals
i cannot recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie ,  which is my favourite from the 1980's by far .  the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in  " big business "  , that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood's golden age .  a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory .  the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in  " big business "  ,  it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york's business world .the story begins in a flash back when wealthy new yorkers hunt and binky shelton are passing through rural backwater jupitor hollow when binky goes into labour .  at the same time locals garth and iona ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of sadie and rose but are also mixed up .  we move forward forty years to where sadie shelton is the corporate head of moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of holomade ,  the local industry in jupitor hollow .  getting wind of their plans the militant jupitor hollow resident rose ratliff decides to go fight these  " pinstriped trouser snakes "  ,  on their own territory and sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring jupitor hollow .  through a mix up they end up staying in the plaza hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as  " sinks in the living room "  ,  and  " soaps in the shapes of swans "  !  complication piles on top of complication as sadie shelton's ex husband michael  ( barry primus )  ,  can't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural sadie for his hard nosed wife and jay marshall ( michael gross )  ,  can't for the life of him understand why rose  ( ratliff )  is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure rose  ( shelton )  .  all comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two sadie's are really the city sheltons while the two rose's are really the twins meant to be in jupitor hollow .  the fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when sadie  ( shelton )  ,  is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to sadie  ( ratliff )  ,  to put all her watching of her idol alexis carrington in  " dynasty "  ,  to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing jupitor hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully .classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins ,  on the classic 1960's comedy series  " the patty duke show "  .  i dont think i've ever seen bette midler in finer form than in  " big business "  .  her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails sadie shelton who's all  " hostile takeovers "  to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin sadie ratliff who only wants to be able to say  " keep the change !  "  is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter .  her classic mirror sequence with her  " twin "  ,  is a total riot and her statement that  " this whole thing has got ufo written all over it !  "  , will have you breaking up with laughter .  equally lily tomlin as both country activist rose ratcliff ,   " i'm gonna go kick some snooty new york ass !  "  ,  and as rose shelton the awkward out of place city girl  " i hate shopping and i hate new york in june !  "  , is also top rate .  her rejection of jay's engagement ring as a supposed  " bribe "  and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a  " great big belly scraping pile of cow plop !  "  ,  is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene i never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening i have of this movie .  of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at new york's plaza hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up .  two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk's  ( joe grifasi )  ,  continual mixing up of sadie shelton/ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined ,  and especially fabio alberici's  ( michele placido )  ,  total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers ,  the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone !  the hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women  ( one from the country and the other from the city )  ,  seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff .  it is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both bette midler and lily tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first .  classics like :   " im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease !  "  ,  " oh my god it's so cosmopolitan "  ,   " oh sure its full of crowds ,  smog ,  sex fiends ,  and white slavers ,  it's a pistol ,  i've got about as much use for it  ( new york )  ,  as a toad has for spit pearls !  "  ,   " computer chips ,  they've got their ways !  "  ,  and  " have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase ?  "  ,  are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script .total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more .  it is a real pity that  " big business "  ,  so far has marked the only time that bette midler and lily tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle .  this film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages .  i've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as i am !  so i'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven't already .  you wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends ,  in bette midler and lily tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in  " big business "  .  enjoy !
this is such a fun movie to watch .  it is so goofy and ridicualous and you never get tired of watching it .  encino man and pauly shore is one of the reasons why the early 90s ruled .  there are so many cool scenes in this like when stoney takes link to 7-11 and they cruise the aisles looking for some grindeage to munch on .  and when they go to the mountian and ride the viper in reverse .  and the drivers ed  scene when link thinks it is rad mobile and he puts it up on two wheels and they end up at the bar with all the mexicans .   " you see that girl muchacho .  dont look at her !  "  the prom scene was cool to ,  it had infectious grooves in it .  they are a real band but that song was made for the movie .  the singer and bass player are in suicidal tendencies and the bass player plays for metallica now .  but anyways .  .  .  yeah  ,  this movie is totally radical .  daves room is really cool to .  i wish my room was that rad .  the school looks cool too .  i wish my high school was like that .  i notice that whenever i watch something like this that was filmed in the early 90s everything seemed real bright and cheerful .  am i crazy or has anyone else noticed this ?  pauly shores punch lines and phrases never get old .  they age like a fine wine .  .  .  bud-dy .
awesome extras !  !  !  !  not to mention the show is awesome !  !  !  kept me on the edge of my seat the whole season !   it was great to watch it again
i am sam is superb to the core .   excellent performances across the board ,  and an emotionally involving story .   sean penn is believable as someone who is mentally challenged .   this is a veritable tour de force for him .   but not to be upstaged is dakota fanning ,  who plays opposite of penn and is named lucy diamond after the hit beatles song .   sean penn's character has to fight for custody of lucy ,  and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer ,  played by michelle pfeiffer ,  for free .   she helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor .   all in all ,  a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness .   one of my favorites
csi : miami ,  having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons ,  reaches its high point in season 3 .  anyone who has watched the show realizes that horatio ,  unlike gil grissom or mac taylor ,  is the true star of the show .  the rest of the csis are entertaining ,  but the show is truly about him .  this dynamic ,  when combined with the glamour and glitz of the miami setting and crimes most foul ,  make this for me the csi that is above the rest .plotwise ,  season 3 is bit over the top .  issues covered in this season include a stalker murder ,  a sports star on trial for his wife's murder ,  a young woman killed in a club ,  the murder of a uniformed cop ,  gang warfare in a hospital ,  the killings of irs agents ,  speed dating that ends in a death ,  spree killing ,  and the murder of a wingwoman .  some of the lesser episodes involve our old friend clavo cruz ,  a giant boa contricter that eats a woman ,  skaters and gamers ,  and of course ,  the infamous tsunami episode .  the season incorporates the raymond caine subplot heavily in the last 5 or 6 episodes .  this leads up to a satisfying conclusion in the season finale .the season is also one of change .  a regular cast member gets killed in episode 1 ,  which quite frankly ,  was quite a relief since the character was terrible .  another regular ,  not a csi ,  kills himself .  a new cast member joins ,  officer ryan wolfe ,  makes the transfer from patrol to csi ,  and making some waves in the process .  callie and delco  ( who has very little to do this season )  have a tough time dealing with tragedy ,  and we actually see horatio dating a rather attractive assistant da ,  at least for a few episodes .  some old familiars pop by ,  including suzy and madison ,  and raymond caine's killer bob ,  who ends up being much more important in the story than we assumed .  all in all it adds up to a great season ,  which will be extremely difficult to top in season 4 .people either love or hate this show ,  so if you count yourself among the fans ,  this is a must addition to the collection .a . g .  corwinst . louis ,  m
a friend with a three year old told us about this product and we purchased it .   wow !   our three year old girl kept wanting to watch it over and over .   we used the dvd along with us talking about numbers and she was doing great .   before pre-school started she was able to add and subtract numbers between 0 - 10 .
the first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation .  it's hard to even describe really .  .  .  but expect some disoriented backgrounds with some cgi thrown in .  the plot however ,  is excellent .  the main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories .  he constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers .  they do what is called  " committing "  someone for their sins .  these first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great .  this anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there
i quite enjoyed watching this film ,  which is why i give it four stars ,  even though i think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic .  so ,  why did i like it ?  joan cusack ,  matt dillon ,  kevin kline  ( in that order )  and also a passably funny script -- at least one that is well structured for a feel-good viewing experience .joan cusack is wonderful here .  her blow-up at her wayward fiance after he stands her up  is fantastic ,  and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street ,  screaming  " is this the twilight zone ?  "  at which point she collapses on the hood of matt dillon's car  ( in her wedding dress no less )  -- well ,  that scene is adorable ,  especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of shakespeare's romeo and juliet -- a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity .  yes ,  here is the heart of the film  ( so i cannot comprehend another viewer's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film ;  she's obviously going to marry the movie star ,  and get to eat cheetos into the bargain )  .  matt dillon is ,  as ever ,  the essence of cuteness ,  and a much more desirable husband than kevin -- um ,  i mean howard .kevin kline does a decent job of mimicking howard ,  a repressed gay man .  but it still feels like mimicking ,  rather than acting .  here is also where the problems begin .  i guess wearing a bow-tie means you are gay .  and ,  similarly ,  the barbra streisand gag is beaten to death  ( and beyond )  .  how many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like barbra ?  ?  !  !  come on !  also ,  kline's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture  .   .   .  not only is it not enough ;  it's really kind of humiliating .nonetheless ,  the final scene does give  " mr .  holland's opus "  a run for its money ,  and i can't deny it :  i did really have fun watching this movie .  it's basically a sound little production ,  well structured ,  reasonably well written ,  and kevin kline can dance
after buying the original  " the fast and the furious "  i found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it .   however ,  i can now say i am a fan of the trilogy  ( all 3 films are good )  .lucas black is simply the man and gives another great performance here .   bow wow does a surprisingly good job as well .   car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie  ( which i am neither )  .   this is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy
this show was excellent in every aspect .  i was captivated from the opening number and stayed glued to my tv until the closing credits .  it was so fun to see the entire osmond clan decked out in their holiday finest having such a wholesome and lighthearted good time .  i especially enjoyed seeing debbie ,  donny's wife sing a duet with donny .  and the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well .  there was even a guest appearance by the osmond grandparents .  i would recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned christmas special .  there is a mixture of traditional christmas songs ,  some uptempo numbers ,  and even some spiritual songs included .  a particularly poignant segment included little brother jimmy singing a song out in the snow .  i'd never seen the two lesser-known older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show .  one of the best christmas specials i've seen in a long time .  it made me wish that i was part of their family .  after watching this i'm more convinced than ever that i am the fat osmond who mother osmond abandoned in the hospital only to be adopted by some nice folks here in the pacific northwest
we love these movies !   they entertain the child as well as the adult !   we went through a period where we watched these every night before bed !   much better than the baby einstein collection !   we've made this our designated baby shower gift !   everyone should have a copy !   they are good for parents as a stress relief .   you don't even need to watch them ,  just have them playing in the background ,  the music is absolutely wonderful .   i love when i catch my kids humming the music as they are playing .   perfect for any age ,  boy or girl !   thank you hbo
oh my .  i love this movie .  it even makes me cry .  it's sexy ,  cute ,  and heartwarming .  yes ,  it's a little bit hokey but what musical isn't ?  i am so excited to get this !  i love this movie .  i'm a huge musical fan and i've been waiting years for this one .  they must have finally convinced whomever had the rights to release it on dvd .  i don't know but i'm really excited !  one hundred million miracles !  i love that philosophy .  it makes me happy and it's a miracle that this is finally available .  get your kids/teens to watch it !
so-so movie .  it has it's good parts along with some boring parts but overall ,  good special effects with the ghosts .  there were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch .  when a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew ,  he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  many ghosts .  just a ok movie .
what a splendid teacher is this !  a soothing ,  captivating movie .  the students are most endearing .i found it interesting that ,  in the special features interview with the guy who made this movie ,  he refers to the teacher as  " the teacher "  and not by his name ,  georges lopes .  this moviemaker appears to be of the opinion that there are a lot of teachers who could have filled this role as well ,  or nearly as well .  well let me tell you ,  he is wrong .  this teacher is special .  there are not very many teachers as patient and diplomatic and considerate on this entire planet as georges lopez
when i first watched this tv movie ,  with an unusal turn by lucille ball as a homeless woman ,  i was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role ,  and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished  " bag lady "  .  although definitely within the  " tv movie "  league ,  this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy
of all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of allah on that day ,  this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching .   because of this ,  those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events .   and perhaps none more so than  " caesar "  in his review of sept .  17 ,  2006 .   if only he found at least as troubling the carnage ,  bloodshed ,  and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his islamic buddies against civilian populations .   but ,  more on this in a bit .as regards this extraordinary video ,  from the perspectives of air traffic controllers ,  faa officials ,  norad and neads ,  the air crews and passengers on board each of the four doomed flights ,  to the testimonies of the witnesses ,  participants ,  firefighters ,  and all the heroes on and near ground zero ,  this is the singular documentary that takes you minute by minute through the hell deliberately planned and perpetrated by those whose religion had them believing that the execution of such hellish bloodshed granted them virgin-laden heaven .    ( and no .  .  .  this is not the  " propaganda "  or view of the documentary ,  but instead my own conclusions drawn on many years of personal investigation of islam )  .anyone who ,  like  " caesar "  here ,  could watch this fully factual account and then call such a splendid documentary  " goody-goody propaganda "   " try ( ing )  to portray the us as good guys being hit by the bad guys .  .  .  "  reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own anti-american hatred for so apparently condoning such ghastly blood-soaked horrors as the acts of  " good guys "  retaliating against  " bad guys .  "while  " caesar "   ( how telling a nickname )  attempts to school us ignorant americans on our country's past political-policy foibles ,  yet he fails to mention the billions in financial and economic aid we have given the islamic nations ,  the millions in military equipment and technical advisory assistance provided them as they struggled against invading soviet forces and/or other foreign enemies attempting to annex and rule over sovereign islamic nations ,  the ousting from kuwait of the brutal armed forces of an islamic fascist dictator who had invaded and then  " enjoyed "  weeks of the metaphoric and all too literal raping in this tiny islamic nation while openly looting ,  terrorizing ,  butchering ,  torturing ,  and murdering its citizens while none of its islamic neighbors lifted so much as a finger to intervene ,  but instead begged the united nations and the u . s .  to solve their problems for them .  .  .  which we did !   and these are just a tiny listing of the far greater acts we have done for the cause of justice and good ,  and all of it on islam's behalf .   and yet ,  9/11 is only the latest and greatest terrorist massacre by which we continue to be repaid by the bloodthirsty religion of islam for all we have done and continue to do on its behalf ." caesar "  also glaringly omits and all too conveniently ignores radical islam's blood-soaked history and their on-going policy of religiously motivated bomb blasts ,  hijackings ,  kidnappings ,  tortures ,  rapes ,  gang rapes ,  female circumcisions ,  sawing and/or hacking off people's limbs and heads ,  mutilations ,  and always .  .  .  mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide ,  including those of their own religion ,  and all thanks to islam's foundational tenets of blood lust that makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable ,  eternally rewardable ,  and thus .  .  .  forever inevitable .true ,  all religions have their radicals and fanatics .   but none deliberately attract ,  nurture ,  and encourage terrorist fanatics more than does islam .   and none preaches genocide against the entire jewish race/nation and all non-islamic  " infidels "  in the name of god more than does islam .   and it is how this video accurately documents for the entire world only this latest and greatest mass butchery in the name of allah that probably motivates  " caesar "  most to attempt such blatant anti-u . s .  propagandizing here .   and for those who would disagree ,  i challenge  " caesar "  or anyone else to provide us any reliable evidence of even a single factual error in this documentary .what i think  " caesar "  fears most is that such a powerful documentary as this might add to the growing world view that despite the constant rhetoric of islam as a religion of  " peace ,  "  the ever-escalating terrorist acts of its leaders and constituents in the name of islamic religion reveal the exact opposite to be the true case .   maybe it's just me ,  but i'm thinking any religion that so encourages its hormone-driven young men to blow themselves up with as many  " infidels "  as they can so as to spend eternity in orgiastic sex with 72 virgins deserves to be fully prosecuted ,  at the very least on charges of  " conspiracy to commit  ( mass )  murder "  !and one thought that just hit me :   if more and more islamics continue to either commit or condone such bloodshed and with the full approval of their islamic leaders ,  which god are they truly honoring and emulating :   allah -- the creator of life ;  or instead ,  iblis  ( satan )  ,  the destroyer of it ?   by their fruits are they known ,  after all .and on the question of whom and what islamics most worship and adore ,  permit me to close this review as also does this wonderful documentary ,  by quoting one of islam's most renowned clerics :" we love death .   the u . s .  loves life .   that is the big difference between us .  "     -- osama bin laden
bonhoeffer was a very informative ,  very interesting video .   i first decided to watch it at the urge of my pastor .   i watched the portion that pbs showed ,  and i wanted to see more ,  so i bought the dvd .   i am glad that i did
my wife and i saw  " love actually "  when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly .  yes ,  richard curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings ,  but it works .   and the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in .when the movie first appeared on hbo ,  i always seem to find it and couldn't stop watching until the end of the movie .   i bought the dvd and it's become a family tradition to watch it christmas eve  ( most years )  .   and it never gets old .i am not a fan of christmas movies .   i've never seen all of  " miracle on 34th street "  or  " its a wonderful life "  ,  but i'm looking forward to sitting on the sofa with my wife to watch  " love actually "  again
harvey milk was the elected supervisor of district 6 in san francisco when he was murdered--along with mayor george moscone on november 27 ,  1978 ,  by fellow supervisor ,  dan white  ( who later claimed the infamous  " twinkie defense "  )  .  the film  " the times of harvey milk "  firmly places the murder of milk ,  a gay politician ,  into the politically significant context of the times .  the crime ,  the verdict ,  and the sentence served were all shocking .  this film tells the story behind the headlines .milk was a stockbroker on the east coast ,  when he decided to pull up roots and head for san francisco .  he opened a camera shop on castro street and quickly earned the name of  " mayor of castro street "  for his enthusiastic community involvement .  his interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office ,  but when the city's elections ran by district--rather than citywide--milk became the newly elected supervisor for the sixth district .  milk's enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall .the film includes photographs ,  newsreel footage ,  and many interviews with those who crossed milk's path in a professional or personal capacity .  milk was passionate about public transportation ,  rent control ,  and the rights of seniors and gays .  white ,  on the other hand ,  found san francisco's gay day  " obscene .  "  eerily ,  there are several photos of milk that also include his killer--clean cut ,  ex-fireman and family man ,  supervisor dan white .  the film explores the flavour of the times--san francisco was becoming a gay mecca ,  and there were some people who couldn't adjust to that fact .  senator john briggs ,  who called san francisco  " the moral garbage dump of the nation "  was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired .  milk fought this ballot tooth and nail ,  and it failed .the film  " the times of harvey milk "  includes two discs .  one disc contains the film ,  and the other disc is packed with extra features--including coverage of the film's premiere in castro street ,  a dan white update ,  1st and 25th anniversary events of the crime ,  director's commentary ,  the academy awards 1985 ,  and a photo gallery .  for those of us who remember the headlines ,   " the times of harvey milk "  is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time--displacedhuma
rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence ,  teenage angst ,  sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from alexander payne .   reese witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range .   matthew broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for witherspoon's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality .   in his screen debut ,  chris klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against witherspoon ,  and jessica campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty .   one of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election .   reese prays to an unfamiliar god and beseeches him to let her win so she  " can carry out his divine plan .  "   campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to ,  while goofy klein shows the most depth by thanking god for all of his blessings  ( especially his large penis )  and telling god he knows the best candidate will win .election is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind .   enjoy
the greatest show ever to hit t . v .  you will never know what happens next on this show and that is one of the many elements that make this show great , it always keeps you guessing and wanting more . c . t . u ( counter terrorist unit )  and c . t . u operative jack bauer ( keifer sutherland ) try and stop terrorist threats all within 24 hours which is in real time .  what i like about this show is that keifer sutherlands character jack bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against c . t . u or the president .  another great aspect of the show is they are not afraid to kill off main characters that you grow to love on the show ,  so you will never now what is going to happen next which keeps you wanting more .  you still reading ,  stop and go buy the first season right now .  hell ,  buy all 4 right now thats how good it is
i have ever seen . what to say for this film . great acting , great story and great music . don't hesitate go get it . this will be one of the gems in your movie collection .and please guys when you come to movies like this masterpiece don't give them a 3 star rate . not beacuse it didn't have many extras or something like this . the movie is that counts
there isn't one wasted second in this film .   not one !  !  !   you'll be sucked in ,  and surprised ,  within the first two minutes ,  and there's very little dialogue so you need not worry about too much subtitle reading .   you can tell there's a lot of influence from american film noir in this film ,  but  " le samourai "  takes it to a level of perfection .   i wish some of the folks that throw their good money towards bad modern action flicks would take the time to watch  " le samourai "  they just might discover a thing or two about how it could really be done .   brilliant
well i thought it was going to stop at volume 1 .   but ,  i guess it didn't .but ,  i am amazed that some of the cast is still living .   i can't believe that skip hinnant who plays fargo north decoder has got gray hair and still seems to be in good health .   not to mention jim boyd who plays j .  arthur crank is also still alive but on the heavy side .   as for judy graubart ,  i can't believe how old and skin and bones she is .   she must've been the oldest actor on the cast because now you should see her today .   hattie winston poor thing ,  i think she must've suffered a stroke or something cause i've noticed in her interviews she twitches every now and then .   we hardly ever see morgan freeman in any of these interviews because he's a big time busy actor .   but ,  i loved the show and am glad they brought this collection together in another set of dvd's from a show i grew up watching when i was 10 .   luis avalos who i loved watching not just on the electric company but in his acting career in movies like stir crazy and then a full role in dom deluise's hot stuff along with his family .   luis still looks the same but has gained some weight too like jim boyd .   it is great that the graphics and color of the sets on each show brings back memories and the songs they sang too brought back some memories .   it is also hard to believe that the voices you hear on the cartoon skits like letterman are zero mostel ,  gene wilder ,  joan rivers ,  and mel brooks .   you wouldn't have thought that there voice talents would be a credit to their success today .   well now we have to get ready for volume 3 .  .  .  .  . will there be ?   .  .  .  .  .  . let's hope so ,  cause i will surely buy it !
since i was a child i have patiently anticipated the battle of evil versus evil .  it was discussed in school yards and in the lunch room ,  at slumber parties and later when i started working as a clerk in a grocery store .  it was a never ending argument- who would win in the battle of freddy and jason ?  in my youth children spoke of some underground video tape that contained a battle between the two monsters ,  but i don't think that it ever existed and if it did i have never laid my eyes on such a relic ,  but finally the horror movie to end all was released onto the big screen and later on to dvd .  it was everything i hoped for .  there was blood ,  brief nudity and really bad jokes .  that is the unholy trinity of horror .  the plot wasn't horrible ,  it was actually pretty good for a fright flick .freddy hasn't graced the silver screen since 1994 when wes craven presented  " new nightmare "  and he kept his integrity intact in my opinion .  jason vorhees on the other hand made the space film  " jason x "  as his last trip to the theatres ,  and if you haven't seen it yet don't bother you didn't miss much .i liked how the movie gave a back story to jason's life at crystal lake and it showed that krueger is conniving and manipulative with getting jason to go along with his plan to kill on elm street once again .  obviously jason is a big dumb animal and does not need much convincing .  the cinematography and directing were excellent ,  i thought the music was done well ,  and most importantly the film stayed true to the original story line .  the only thing that upset me was after all these years waiting for this battle to come i was wrong about who would be victorious .
director richard donner  ( ladyhawke ,  superman ,  lethal weapon i ,  ii ,  iii ,  iv ,  etc .  )  leads an ensemble cast of stars gerard butler ,  billy connolly ,  frances o'connor ,  ethan embry ,  morton csokas and david thewlis  " back into time only to find out that if history had not been changed by these characters the present might not exist !  "   ( yeah !  i wrote those words !  not another critic yet it's a true analysis of this fantastic film !  )if you loved richard donner's ladyhawke then timeline  ( 2003 )  based on the novel by michael crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely !  modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor .  on the way and in the way are knights of not so good caliber ,  ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there !my rating of timeline is five stars !  i can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you ,  the viewer to truly enjoy it ,  i'm not !  when i saw timeline for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful donner production and billy connolly ,  a scot to whom my heart had been lost .  the character of  " marek "   ( gerard butler )  enslaved me upon my first sight of him !  as  " creedy "  in reign of fire i'd fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that i'd gone to cheer on in the film .   " creedy's "  torched demise gave me cause to end their existence .   " marek "  is yet another character such as ladyhawkes  " navarre .  "   ( rutger hauer )  for ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man's man ,   " marek "  is your fellow !timeline is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to  " back to the future !  "  this is one film not only well worth the money but well worth the time to view over again and again !  for ladies who despair of a real man keep this one within hand's grasp at a moment's notice !   : - )
federico fellini's 1972 film is not his best ,  when he has 8 1/2 ,  la strada and la dolce vita to his credit .  while many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless ,  dreamy structure ,  i found it boring and phantasmagorical .  it is simply fellini's version of rome and not rome ,  the eternal city itself .  to risk sounding negative ,  i shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970's rome - the scenes in which the hippies and american tourists invade the city ,  the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off  ( though saying some pretty vulgar things )  and my favorite scene- the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old roman patricians fade into oblivion .  but mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot .  it starts off alright ,  and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences .  fellini is himself in this movie ,  as well as gore vidal .  fellini envisions himself as a young man studying rome in his youth in a strict catholic school  ( the slide/projector shows ancient monuments like the colliseum ,  the apian way ,  trevi fountain and vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman's behind )  and later as a young man journeys to rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum .  then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless ,  vulgar and long-winded .  i found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage !  it bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution ,  brothels or cheap ,  slutty women .  the cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film .  and for a film about rome and italy ,  there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater .  the pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous .  only serious ,  hardcore fans of fellini will want to own this dvd .  it is a perfect follow-up to his equally absurd and sexually radical satyricon ,  loosely based on the old roman epic .

most people doesn't realize that this band suck's !  !  !  !i am a  " hard-core rocker fan "  but please !  !  is not because this band doesn't know how to play music or is fictional ,  is beacause it suck's !  !the reason that spinal tap suck's is because of their bloopers in live-concert and most of all their stupid lyrics !  !  !  !  !i mean :" you know what i need ,  or maybe you don't !  !  !  !  !  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  "" lisen ,  shhhhh !  !  what the flower people say aaaaahhhhh !  !  !  !  !  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  "" the cats meow !  !  !  ?  ?  ?  "" sex farm woman !  !  !  ?  ?  ?  "" big button !  !  !  !  ?  ?  "" i just want to make some eardrums bleed !  !  !  !  ?  ?  ?  ?  "come on !  people !  !  !  !  try to realize why this movie is sooo funny !  beacuse all the people like a band that is pure garbage !  !  !  !  !  !but don't get me wrong !  i did enjoy this movie ( documentary really )  because is a parody of the rock bands in the 60's ,  70's and early 80's .  and their music is loud ,  fast and heavy !  !  !adios .
if you're even showing an interest to vol . 2 then you most likely own or have seen vol . 1 .  even then i recommend this one as much as any of them ,  since you gotta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end .  anyways ,  vol . 2 offers the same fun antics the 1st vol .  did ,  but unfortunately when compared to vol . 1 you'll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all .  any sword fighting that actually occur usually doesn't last long enough to be considered a  " fight "  .  but this dvd makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the 1st vol .  so enjoy it ,  i know i did
lots of good exercises and lots of helpful hints .  good dvd !  would recommend it to friends
there's only one word to describe this movie :  suhweeeeeeeet !  despite the dozens of imitators ,  bloodsport was the first and best of its kind .  from the classic training sequence where young frank dux masters the martial arts  ( and receives the katana he coveted as a boy )  ,  to the motley group of tournament fighters with their goofy fighting techniques ,  to the repeated chanting of  " ku-mi-te !  ku-mi-te !  ku-mi-te !  "  on the pounding soundtrack ,  there's hardly a moment that won't have you pumped and calling for more .  the only parts that don't quite work are the chase scenes and a young forest whittaker ,  who seems not to have completely understood what sort of production he was appearing in .  but they don't detract from the main attraction :  bone-crushing ,  blood-spattering beatdowns ,  and plenty of 'em .  this is a quintessential guys' movie ,  and if you haven't seen it ,  you owe it to yourself to check it out
i'd seen this film before ,  in a lesser unrestored edition ,  and wasn't that impressed .  sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two ,  but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull .  hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be .thanks to mike nelson's biting commentary ,  however ,  now the film really is funny .  damn funny .  which is why i demand we pass legislation ,  the sooner the better ,  requiring mike nelson commentaries on every major dvd release from here on out .  he may be hollywood's last best hope ,  the only man who can save excrement like mission impossible 3 and lady in the water from heading straight to the bargain racks .( okay ,  maybe i'm overrating mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an old testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of lady in the water - but if lucas gave him a crack at episodes 1-3 ,  i think we'd be looking at pure marketing gold .  c'mon lucas ,  you know you can't resist any excuse to re-release yet another dvd version of your little sci-fi sextology .  give the man a call .
this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out .   an excellent and energetic movie from the start .  plot is cutesy .   it serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences .   however ,  i think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes ?   i would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me .if memory serves me ,  didn't alex receive a letter from her friend ,  hannah ,  when alex discovered hannah passed away ?   isn't there a reconnection at the end between mickey and alex's  ( girl ) friend whom the latter was dating ?   wasn't there more of a story build-up between alex and her boss ?   if this version is cut in anyway ,  i prefer getting the complete and unedited version .   i find this version incomplete somehow .but jennifer beals looks terrific and one wonders why she didn't star in more movies for her generation
i find this film to be very different to most american films .   it is very funny in its own way and make you think about the true meaning of money and its relationship to happyness .it is on my ten best films .
season 1 of  " millennium "  featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made  " the x-files "  look sunny by comparison .  unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a  " murder mystery of the week "  fare .  thankfully the second season ,  supervised by former  " x-files "  producers glen morgan and james wong ,  changed all that .  the second season began with the suspenseful 'beginning and the end' ,  where frank black pursues the mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife .  this episode also introduces the comic relief for season two ,  computer hacker brian roedecker .even though 'the beginnning and the end' would fit perfectly in season 1 ,  the subsequent episodes follow a different path that greatly improved the series .  starting with the second episode ,  'beware of the dog' ,  and continuing with episodes such as 'the hand of st .  sebastian' ,  'owls' ,  'roosters' ,  and the haunting two-part season finale 'the fourth horseman/the time is now' ,  we find out that the millennium group has existed since the beginnings of christianity and isn't nearly as altruistic as frank black  ( and the viewers )  originally suspected .in addition to the millennium group storyline ,  we also learn more about frank's childhood via two holiday episodes :  'the curse of frank black' ,  a halloween-themed tale where frank encounters the ghost of a neighbor who committed suicide ,  and 'midnight of the century' ,  an emotional story of frank trying to mend the relationship between him and his father .  in the latter we find out that frank was not the only one with a strange gift ,  as his mother was blessed/cursed with the ability to see angels .  lastly the second season even showcased two comedy episodes :  'jose chung's doomsday defense' and 'somehow satan got behind me' .  these hours of television are completely different from the average  " millennium "  episode  ( to say the least )  but they're still worth a look nonetheless .i could continue rambling on and on about the greatness of season two ,  but you'll really have to buy the dvd set and form your own opinions .  the dvd set does come with some bonus features ,  but the only one of worth is the season two documentary  " turning of the tide "  .  the rest of the bonus materials are second-rate at best
bruce almighty is a great movie .  it about a newsreporter ,  bruce nolan  ( jim carrey )  ,  that has a bad day a work ( gets fired )  and thinks that god is punishing him .  so god  ( morgan freedman )  meets him at a warehouse and tell bruce that he can have all his powers .  then bruce has fun with the god powers gets his job back ,  but sometimes its hard to be god .  you'll have to watch the rest of the movie to find the rest out .   :  )their are some great parts in the movie like when he gets a monkey to crawl out of a guys butt ,  when he gets prayers ,  it saids  " you got prayers "  instead of  " you got mail "  .overall the story was pretty good and funny .  if you want to have some good laughs and giggles ,  watch this and some scenes are not appropriate with children .  hehe .  though it is pg-13 .rating 9 . 2/1
this is a great movie !   i would encourage everyone to see this one .  .  .  even if you have never even known someone with this condition ,  you should buy this movie .   there are not enough movies like this one out there .   we need to support this type of film making .   i don't want to give the plot of the movie away ,  so i won't go into great detail .   watching this movie gives me hope .   hope for so many people out there with this illness .   hope that they or someone close to them will watch this and will give this diet a try .   don't give up hope .   thank you to whomever made this film possible .
this anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network ,  and now is definetly considered a classic alongside cowboy bebop and others .  this is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people .  yoko kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect .  it's so beautiful and fits the story so well .  the overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful .as for the languages and region ,  while i wouldn't know yet for this particular box set ,  i would assume it is just like the individual dvds they put out with japanese and english language and english subtitles .  and i don't know where to look for the region of the dvd ,  but i think it might be region 1 ,  whatever it means .  i do know that i haven't had any troubles playing it on any of our dvd players .[  .  .  .  ]
art history has always been an interest of mine ,  and i'm a big fan of other art movies such as  " girl with a pearl earing "  and  " merchant of venice .  "  so when i found out about modigliani i was happy to take the time to go watch it .  not only was it worth my time ,  but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion wasn't looked fondly on .everything about the movie is amazing ,  from the sets to the acting .  i feel this is one of andy garcia's best films in some time ,  not only is he convincing ,  but he fits the part of modigliani better than any other actor could .  they focused the movie around his rivalry with picasso ,  which i find to be one of the most interesting things about it .  you don't only get an insight into one artist ,  but many .  you see the life the artists were living and the obstacles they had to overcome to get their art out into the world .modigliani also had a tragic romance with a young catholic girl ,  who's father didn't want her with the struggling painter .  the story is the perfect depiction of the religious standards in that time period .overall this was a great movie ,  and i would strongly suggest that you take the time to check it out .  you won't regret it ,  it's probably one of the best movies of the year
many shows have their moments ,  but this is the first show i've ever laughed out loud ,  multiple times in one episode .   the humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed .   i will say that you do need to be around my age  ( i'm 40 )  to get alot of the inside jokes ,  but if you do their hilarious .   and if you don't there's still plenty to make you laugh .   i would highly recommend all three volumes that are out now
" dr .  strangelove :  or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb "  is one/third of the films that are considered stanley kubrick's masterpieces  ( the other two are 2001 :  a space odyssey & a clockwork orange )  .   it's a satire ,  released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today .  whenever you look at a list of great movies ,  it's on there .  it holds a place on the american film institute's top 100  ( #26 )  ,the american film institute's top 100 comedies  ( #3 )  ,  is featured in roger ebert's  " the great movies ,  "  and is just ,  overall ,  acknowledged as a fine piece of cinema .  the movie opens with general jack d .  ripper  ( sterling hayden )  launching an unauthorized nuclear attack against russia .  the general is clearly mad and believes that the russians are polluting everyone's valuable bodily fluids .  the only person who can stop ripper is captain mandrake  ( peter sellers )  ,  a british guy who listens to ripper's ranting in disbelief .  meanwhile ,  at the pentagon ,  the president of the united states ;  president muffley  ( peter sellers ,  again )  assembles a meeting in the war room where he is told hesitantly by general buck turgidson  ( george c .  scott )  that the bombers can not be recalled ,  no one can reach ripper ,  etc .  in one of the most hilarious characters i've ever seen portrayed on screen ,  we meet dr .  strangelove  ( peter sellers ,  yet again )  a strategist aiding the people in the war room .  strangelove's right hand ,  covered in a black glove ,  has a mind of its own .  .  . it frequently throws up nazi salutes and tries to kill strangelove .  also happening in the story is one of the planes heading to russia to drop the bomb .  the ruler of the cockpit is major  " king "  kong  ( slim pickens )  ,  a character that was supposed to be played by sellers but reportedly couldn't because sellers had recently suffered a broken angle .  the scene where kong rides a nuclear bomb as if he was riding a bull is one of the scenes in the movie that you're not likely to forget .  now ,  this is a funny and important film ;  but it's not my favorite kubrick film ,  nor is it the most entertaining kubrick film .  but due to it's significance and the performances  ( by sellers ,  hayden ,  and especially scott )  it definitely deserves the term  " masterpiece .  "entertainment :  bhumor :  a-importance :  aoverall grade :  a-

to anchor bay entertainment :  if you release the grey fox on dvd we'll buy it !this is truly a great film .five stars is as good as it gets .  can you ask for more incentive than that ?
masterful pretty much says it all .  i agree with the reveiwers who rated it  " one of the best all time movies " ---not just among westerns .  this film is wayne's high noon .  the hard edges play well with today's viewers and the things we confront .  you will travel with the duke as he is consumed by hate .  he's not out to save the young lady ,  but to destroy her .  what will happen when he is face to face with her ?  watch and enjoy a great film !   if you are looking for a new western i highly recomemend  " broken trail !
regarding the above title ,  there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the dvd .  there seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the usa and the uk as they do very little to the film's context .  still ,  it's a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore  ( if that's what you're into )  and i'd still give it a 9 1/2 out of 10
just behind wings of desire is federico's masterpiece .a true icon .   8 1/2 not only resounds with my italian catholicupbringing as it displays in obvious detail the time-wastingprogression of guilt and shame ;   it commands me to againpossess the mantra quoted from wall street :    " to be rich enoughnot to waste time "  .
lil abner is a delightful comedy-musical with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals .   this film version of the broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on dvd in a beautiful print with it's comic book coloring .   it's also superbly cast .   the film's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play lil abner and daisy mae - peter palmer  ( who starred in the broadway show )  and leslie parrish - but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles  ( it's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as abner anyway ,  although daisy mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era )  .  it's a shame neither palmer or parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years .  both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals ,  as the dogpatch crowd might say .it's true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable - notably  " jublian p .  cornpone "  ,   " a typical day in dogpatch "  ,  and  " put 'em back the way they was "  which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young valerie harper  (  " rhoda "  )  and beth howland  (  " alice "  )  but most of the songs are good-humored  and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original broadway show .   jerry lewis has a funny walk-on cameo and the gorgeous julie newmar and stella stevens have amusing secondary roles .  most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here ,  including donna douglas as the busty hillbilly girl  ( a few years before becoming famous as one on the beverly hillbillies )  who wants  " to broaden our horizons "  and is informed by mammy yokum  ( superbly played by billie hayes )  that she her horizons is broaden enough .   there's quite a bit of political satire in here as well  ( with politicans with such apt names as mayor dogmeat and senator jack s .  phigbound )  and the sadie hawkins day sequence  ( a dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it's own with many high schools for years having an annual   " sadie hawkins dance "  in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered  " acceptable "  )  is a lot of fun .   but then so is the movie .   as a yoakam says when they really mean it -  " i has spoken !  "
i've seen the pilates infomercials for a while now ,  but have been intimidated by the seemingly impossible movements .  when i found this inexpensive  " for dummies "  dvd ,  i decided to give it a try .  what a workout !  i consider myself to be in moderately good shape ,  and this workout can definitely be felt !  within the first couple of days i immediately noticed a change in my posture ,  and a good burn in my abs ,  hips and thighs .  i highly recommend this as both a great workout and a wonderful intro to pilates .
great acting and development in the multi-linear plot movie .  very heavy movie however ,  that may be out of some people's  " reach "  as to understanding and appreciation .  strisand and nolte were both brilliant
i'm a big fan of roseanne ,  so it was no surprise to me that the halloween edition wouldn't be great .tina
an absolutely wonderful movie .  i love it so much that i watch it once a month or so .  ang lee did an amazing job of emma thompson's screen play .  emma thompson won a golden globe award for her efforts .  just lovely
if you are a dale jr fan , this dvd is for you !  !  i'm a hardcore fan and i loved this . it shows the other side of dale off the track , him with his buddies and just hangin out . he lets you into his life which it pretty neat considering not many other drivers have done that . in the hidden footage you even get to see his cat bud which adorable !  !  ! he shows off his new home and the shop
if you haven't already seen this one ,  do not wait until  " tomorrow "  ,  do it today .this is one of the most delightful musicals of recent years .  great performances by aileen quinn as annie ,  albert finney as daddy warbucks ,  carol burnett is outstanding as ms hannigan and tim curry & bernadette peters make convincing nasties .  the music is great and the easy-to-miss one-liners are delightful .  all-in-all ,  a must see ,  and a must-possess movie
this excellent dvd gives us a remarkable version of martin scorsese's film .  it has been color corrected by scorsese himself ,  and remastered for superior sound quality .the concert on thanksgiving day in 1976 was the final concert of the band ,  with its original lineup .  numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion .  the band were clearly at the top of their game that night ,  despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them .  classic songs like  " up on cripple creek "  ,   " stage fright "  , and  " they night they drove old dixie down "  are given excellent rendtions .  the guest stars seem to be having a good time ,  with backing by the band themselves .  ronnie hawkins does an outstanding  " who do you love "  .  dr .  john does his classic  " such a night "  .  joni mitchell performs her underrated  " coyote "  .  a high-kickin' van morrison rocks the house with  " caravan "  .  and blues legend muddy waters does a spectacular  " mannish boy "  .  in a  " making of "  featurette ,  scorsese says waters' perforance of this song was almost not filmed ,  because most of the cameras ran out of film .  fortunately ,  one cameraman caught the whole song ,  so we can have this excellent performance .neil young ,  eric clapton , and bob dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup .  scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of the band .the dvd also incudes two commentaries .  one features scorsese and robbie robertson ,  the other features levon helm ,  garth hudson ,  and guests stars hawkins and mavis staples .  they all have good stories to tell ,  and serve to enhance the film quite well .  a previously unseen jam ,  and an eight page booklet written by robertson round out the dvd .i highly reccomend this dvd to this classic film's many fans
if you can get through david's boot camp video with moderate effort ,  this video may be a bit too easy for you .   that said ,  this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser .   david does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form .   he is very encouraging throughout .   the workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used  ( two dumbbells needed )  .   there are a few innovative moves thrown in as well .since the difficulty level of any workout video is relative ,  i'll give a quick background of myself - i run 4-5 times a week ,  for a total of 40+ miles/week .   i also lift weights 2-3 times a week ,  incorporating plyometrics and compound movements .   i've personally found david's boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using 5-lb dumbbells and think this one-on-one video is great for days i have less energy .   regardless of fitness level ,  you are sure to enjoy this workout .   if you need to make it more intense ,  use heavier weights .   the biggest thing to remember about david's style  ( in my opinion )  is to really *focus* on every repetition ,  *focus* on the muscle being worked ,  and *focus* on isometrics  ( contracting the muscle without movement - eg .  pushing against a brick wall is isometric )  .   hope this helps
`sophie scholl - die letzten tage'  ( `sophie scholl - the final days' )  follows the last six days of the life of sophie scholl ,  member of `the white rose' small anti-nazi organization that protested against hitler through the non-violence method in the war-time munich .  her life had been filmed in germany twice before - `the white rose' by michael verhoeven ,  and `the five last days' by percy adlon both in 1982 .  unfortunately i haven't seen them ,  but the fact proves that this anti-war organization during the wwii in germany ,  some part of which still remain mystery ,  has been always a very fascinating topic in that country .now ,  using the unpublished materials that were unavailable then ,  german director marc rothemund made another film based on this important episode in the german history .  this time he gives stress to the realistic description of the last six days of sophie scholl ,  a 21-year-old college student who was arrested with her brother during the political activities against the nazi in 1943 .actually sophie was only posting and scattering the anti-hitler fliers in college campus ,  but that was enough for the nazi ;  at first ,  however ,  they were not sure .  sophie is just an ordinary student ,  and the nazi interrogator robert mohr was not convinced .the film spends considerable time in depicting the dialogues between sophie scholl and robert mohr ,  and the rising tension between two real-life characters ,  supported by historical material and strong acting ,  is one of the most impressive parts of the film .  consequently the film becomes a bit talky sometimes ,  but both julia jentsch  ( `the edukators' )  and gerald alexander held did a fantastic job as two realistic persons with souls ,  without making them too saintly or monstrous .if you're looking for the facts about the white rose itself ,  you may be disappointed .  the behaviors of sophie and hans ,  her brother ,  before their arrest by the police look incredibly reckless ,  far from that of organized resistance .  the film would not tell you much about what the group was really doing before they were caught because it is about the spiritual transformation of sophie scholl .  i don't know anything about the historical accuracy of the film ,  but it is clear that the filmmakers took great care to present the most accurate portrait of sophie scholl  ( see the detailed procedures of the court ,  for example )  .  because of that ,  the film sometimes gets slower than it should be ,  but still the powerful acting from the actors are as fascinating as this historical event itself .but the strongest ,  or i should say ,  the most shocking part of the film is waiting for you at the end of the film .  one image still haunts my mind ,  which i can't tell you of course ,  but all i can say is ,  prepare for one sequence that is more unnerving and disturbing any suspense or horror films .like `downfall' another gripping german film about the nazi ,  `sophie scholl - die letzten tage' gives you a realistic image of a human during the war .  and this is a heart-wrenching story about one real-life person that lived an extraordinary life .
when i sat down to watch a movie called three woman with the knowledge that one of the three woman is shelley duvall ,  my first reaction was that i would be better off drinking a nice ,  tall glass of toilet water .  but ,  that reaction was short lived .  it is rare for me to enjoy a movie that i was determined to hate from the first second ,  but this movie forced me to pull a 180 .  the ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go .  it is a trance like movie .  i found that i couldn't stop from watching yet ,  i didnt know why i was watching .  very bizzare ,  and very mezmerizing .  not a movie that will be enjoyed over and over however .
i loved this play .  it provided drama suspense ,  comedy ,  inspiration ,  and great music .  tyler perry has done it again .sit back relax and enjoy the message
perfect for kids age 3 and up - highly recommended .  not a scary way to teach kids about safety ,  just helps kids stay smart on the safe side
i glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is  " intellectual "  because it is made anywhere but the usa .   in their eyes america can do no right .   my other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame .
i love good underrated movies ,  they make you feel like you're part of a priviledge club of connoisseurs .  i'm not a movie buff ,  but deep cover has all the elements you would expect of a classic  :  great acting ,  memorable lines ,  interesting  (  and logical  )  plot and a decent ending .laurence fishburne is at his best in his role of an undercover cop slowly crossing the line between pretending to be a drug dealer and pretending to be a cop .  jeff golblum is one of those actors you either love or hate ,  and i loved him playing the dirty lawyer laundering drug money .  there's a great chemistry between the two and the supporting cast ,  which to me ,  was one of the main weakness of new jack city .the use of laurence fishburne's character as the narrator works wonder ,  and somewhere between the slow ,  dark wailings of the movie theme ,  the nightime shots of downtown la and laurence fishburn's poetic lines ,  the movie grabs you into a world ,  an urban jungle ,  crowded with nightime vultures ,  heartless killers and hopeless junkies .  deep cover is somewhere between fables and magical realism ,  a place where reality exceeds fiction .a great movie ,  the dvd is so so ,  almost no extras ,  and the picture quality is good ,  without being great .
this movie may not be for everyone ,  but to me it's highly memorable .possible spoiler alert :this isn't your ordinary  " travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about " -flick  ( back to the future--although ,  granted ,  it was better made and more entertaining )  .butterfly effect is really about  ( in alphabetical order )  acceptance ,  chance ,  charity ,  choice ,  grownup love ,  hope ,  identity ,  opportunity ,  regret ,  and sacrifice .some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting .   here are my thoughts :kutcher to me always seemed an innocent ,  caring ,  small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as ,  and that's why i wasn't surprised to see him pull off this role .amy smart was good mostly ,  but glaringly off-key at times  ( granted she had to show more range the the other actors )
okay ,  how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants ?   unless you were one of the misery causing bee-otches ,  you didn't .   this movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena ,  but takes a good crackshot at the mothers  ( kirstie alley's character is a real gem !  )  .   it also makes fun of the people in minnesota .   i see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film ,  but heard the term  " midwest "  used far more often .   we feel your pain ,  but i would have laughed had they picked my state  ( which is very close to mn )  .   they poke fun at hunters ,  lutherans  ( yes ,  i'm one )  ,  and lutefisk for lunch in high school  ( i'm also of norwegian decent )  .the most fun to be had is the way this movie spoofs how nasty women can be regardless of class warfare ,  and what lengths some of them will go to just to get their way .   funny and dead-on like the nailhead beneath a hammer ,  this movie is a nasty and fun treat for everyone who has ever been treated badly by the so-called local uppercrust .   enjoy 100 minutes of vengeance ,  and then go out into the world feeling better about the fact that you're definitely not alone !
all monty python movies are a must-see .  i think my generation has seen them all .  i hope the younger generation  ( less than 40 )  watch at least one .  the humor is at many levels ,  so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in .  this just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing .  like all good humor ,  it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general ,  as well as ,  politics and religion  ( without getting nasty )
i was very keen on the early poseidon adventure which i liked .  so i was keen to see what wolgang petersen ,  a director i do like ,  could do with the story .it found it to being a good movie .  it did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next .  so much so i lost track of time throughout the movie .having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort .  in which case ,  i would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original .  the characters are not so interesting nor is the acting .  the story was better explained in the first one and more believable .  the special effects are approximately as good .  the filming however is better as the newer technology shows .still it is worth looking at .
i can't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars .   i don't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews ,  but this is certainly not a bad movie .   i was in 7th grade when it came out and i remember how popular it was back then .   everyone ,  and i mean everyone loved it .   no one said they didn't like it .   even my dad to this day says he wouldn't mind watching the movie a few more times ,  and he never wants to watch a movie more than two times .the actors ,  the direction ,  the story everything about this movie worked .   it's a movie that will remain a classic forever .   there's something here for everyone .
well ,  actually i bought this nice cable ,  at amazon marketplace great offering that it was ,  for an hdtv tuner ,  which bombed in my neighborhood .  so ,  i never did get to unpack the cable .  but it's in the closet ,  and it knows it's a good cable .  great cable ,  @ great price ,  thru amazon
i bought this package purely for the keyboard .  i wanted a new one with wireless technology and i was driven to bluetooth just because it is so reliable .  i do not use the keyboard and mouse together ,  however .the keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards i've ever used .  i am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential .  the pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized .  the only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home ,  end ,  page up ,  page down ,  and delete keys .  they moved them around from the conventional way which i still haven't gotten used to but it's fine .i have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard .  i play a game called stepmania  ( a sort of dance dance revolution clone for pc )  which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard .  i've experienced no problems here ,  it's spot on and probably the fastest ever .  the only problem ,  really ,  is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect .  after that however ,  there are no problems at all .i do not use the mouse with the keyboard .  i decided to use it as a mouse with my ibook since it had built-in bluetooth .  i had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly .  i don't use the mouse very much ,  but the times i do use it i experience no problems .both the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice .  i can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems .the battery life on the keyboard is also very nice ,  esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature .  i have had to replace the batteries once since i got the unit in january of 06  ( currently june of 06 )  .  i have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet ,  but i do not use it very much .others complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the bios or startup screens ,  but i haven't had any issues with that .  it depends on how recent your motherboard is ,  and mine is relatively new so i had no problems .i highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse ,  or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop .  either way ,  you cannot go wrong with this package ,  it is extremely excellent
great cable that works as advertised .   why spend $80 on a name brand cable which performs no better or no worse .   connected a third gen mot 6412 dvr with hd to a sony 36xbr800 .  great picture .   a name brand cable will not transmit your digital signal 6' any better than this cables unlimited brand will
i'm using this ap ,  along with a netgear 802 . 11g pc card to test streaming live/recorded tv to other parts of my house .   seems like a capable product even if i didn't use the 108mbps feature .however ,  be sure to update the firmware or the ap might not work correctly .   when i first received it ,  configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my netgear and hp centrino notebook .   both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an ip address from my network's dns server .   a firmware upgrade solved the problem and the ap now streams tv realibly from my living room to the kitchen .i noticed that there is are hordes of wireless aps around my house ,  i guess most neighbours are using some form of 802 . 11 wireless as well .   however ,  this d-link ap is able to function correctly abeit all the other aps around  ( 2 using the same channel as mine i've found )  .overall ,  recommended if you want a good ap .   just be sure to update the firmware
i bought this for my kids computer when i bought a new one for hubby and myself .  .  .  these speakers sound better then the more expensive ones i have .  .  .  .i highly recommend these speaker
about 2 1/2 years ago i finally got into the digital age .   i began printing my own pictures and have tried every brand of photo paper out there  ( kodak ,  hp ,  store brands ,  etc .  etc .  )  .   by far ,  the most superior paper is canon .   they make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints great photos .i did a wedding album using canon photo paper and the couple i gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they'd hired ,  which speaks volumes to the quality of canon paper .i'd highly recommend that people use this brand .   you won't be sorry
i bought this headset and i must say it's a great buy .  first off it's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams .  it's small which definately helps when your wearing it around .  at times it's like you don't even feel liek your wearing anything .  exactly how a headset should be .  i've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires .  the only problem i have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset .  not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones .  but that a small price to pay for such a great ,  inexpensive headset like this one
we used the gtx600vp4 to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling .  the 5-watt power gave us ample range .  does it reach 18 or 20 miles ,  don't know .   but 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem .  range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the rocky mountains .  it's a great way to stay in touch when traveling .  the batteries are rechargeable ,  both a/c & d/c .  the ear pieces were very good for privacy .  very easy to use and well worth the price .  a good investment .
the hp12c has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years .  i bought my first one when i was a consultant and it lasted until august 2006 .  it withstood all the travel and constant use well .  i use it for simple and complex math ;  statistical analysis and financial analysis .  it is much faster and simpler to operate than a pc .  my new one has all the same great features .  i highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis .
well ,  the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock .   its very simple .  just put your ipod on there and rock out to the beat .  the bose quality is very obvious ,  and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it ,  which brings me to my next point .  its too expensive .  my recomendation is to buy an fm transmitter and listend to your ipod on any fm raido .   the only disadvantage of an fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod ,  and its slightly easier ( but thats what ipod is all about ,  isnt it .  .  .  ?  )basically ,  im saying buy it if you have a lot of mone
although there are more expensive options ,  if you're just looking for something to keep your ipod from sliding all over in the car ,  the isqueez is a great option .i use this with the monster icarplay fm transmitter/charger ,  which uses the dock connector .   i can't get my ipod mini to fit all the way down in where it should because of this ,  but it still fits in there well enough to stay in place .i find that it holds the ipod at a great angle for viewing the screen from where you're sitting  ( though i'd recommend putting the passenger in charge of finding music )
this was one of the cheapest tv mounts and it had all the options the expensive ones had it will pull away from the wall as well as allow the screen to pivot up and down . it also compacts up close to the wall .i dont know what other features someone would want in a mount .it is also very smooth when it moves and there is not any deflection or sloppiness in the construction ,  altough i only put a 14 "  lcd on it
operation of the sony dvpnss550/b single disc dvd player has been straight forward .   picture quality is very good ,  and the desired basic features have functioned without problems .   in other words ,  in the 2 1/2 months since we have owned this player ,  quality and reliability have been high .   price too was very reasonable .   that means durability is the last quality to consider ,  which is why i have given the player a 4 rather than a 5 .   there is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years .   but we won't know that for years .
i have had no problems with my mini cruzer usb flash drive .  it has been recognized without exception by multiple computers and has performed flawlessly
i found this on clearance at another retailer  ( i guess not everyone likes pink )  ,  and it's fabulous .   i thought it might be just for skinny-armed people ,  but not so !   i've got plenty of room ,  it fits great ,  and it doesn't move .   still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way ,  though .   makes mowing the lawn way more fun
i have not had n . e . w .  coverage for this apple product however i had a washing machine covered by them .   the washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same .   n . e . w .  used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off .   throughout ,  n . e . w .  was great and made every effort to fix the machine .   when the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that i paid for it .   they did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that i actually had the machine
works well with canon 10d ,  30d ,  and s40 .   fairly fast write speed .   and 4gb - pretty big  ( 1600 jpgs in the 30d !  )
i have paired this with my linkysys wireless-g router and i have not had any problems with either .  the modem installed without any issues .  prior to this modem i was using an rca which began having connection problems .  since the linksys install i have rock solid connection to the internet and a more stable wireless network .  previously i would expirience intermittant  " drop outs "  and would have to reboot .  currently i couldnt be more satisfied has been a good 3 month
these 2 . 0 speakers sound great  ( and not just for their size )  ,  are adjustable ,  small ,  and good looking .  i'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when i turned the volume up so i could understand human speech .  i'm happy i spent the money .  these are real quality in my opinion
there is a light that always stays on and it is distracting ,  as others have noted .  otherwise ,  it is great .  good design ,  works well ,  no complaints .  but that light .  .  . why did they design it with that ?
i had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up .  .  . but after a little tweaking ,  it works beautifully .   previously owned regular crt .  .  . what an improvement !   superb clarity and brightness .   for the money you just can't go wrong with this one
the belkin cassette adapter was my 2nd attempt at a product that would allow me to play my ipod through car cassette deck .  the first ,  non-belkin ,  product  ( can you say monster here ?  )  was crap .  .  . stopped working properly after two weeks .  the belkin adapter has performed flawlessly for 2+ months now
this ain't cheap ,  but it's worth it .  i've learned my lesson buying cheaper toner cartridges ,  but they don't even come close to the quality and longevity of the brother brand .  you get what you pay for .  .
this review concerns the  " v3 "  hardware and firmware v3 . 0_20 - i did not purchase from amazon .for the most part ,  everything works pretty well .   i have discovered a bug where the log is not cleared after a scheduled-email out ,  which leads to strange behavior for the log-emailing function .   i can always go into the web-interface to view or clear it with no problem .   another thing to note regarding the log is that vpn  ( not pass-thru )  has its own separate log area ,  which does not get emailed out .as expected ,  netgear support is mediocre .   level 1 support can only handle very simple issues and level 2 support is very slow .   i recommend you use the incident-submission area of the  " my netgear "  website ,  so you can more easily track/respond to support incidents .for those of you using the fr114p model ,  this is basically the same thing with 8-connection vpn service minus the printer port .i figure ,  after a few more firmware revisions ,  this will be a really good unit
this is a corded mouse ;  fits comfortably in your hand .   moves smoothly across table surface ;  works well on a mousepad as well if you need wrist support .worked out of the box  ( except for the application button )  for the different buttons on the mouse .   the internet buttons allow for a page forward/ back with your thumb .   there are also line up/down buttonw above and below the scroll wheel that allow for more control in scrolling .the scroll wheel feel good ,  better than some other mice i have used .i opted to use the native windows xp mouse driver ,  so the application button does not work ,  but the windows taskbar is not much of a hardship  : - )  ;  and i prefer not to clutter up my system with another set of marginal utility software
a simple ,  cheap investment .   this cf reader actually does what it should ,  i . e .  transfer info from compact flash to the computer .   previous kodak 1 . 0 multi-card reader had issues after a few weeks ,  and stopped working after 2 months .   this one is much faster and is still working .   ahhhhh
the fang is amazing !  !  !  !  !  i just got it , theres nothing like it .  the keyz are in the perfect spot to kill all your fellow gamers .  all you need is the fang and a mouse and your good to go .  you have to get this if you want to stand a chance in fps games .
at first ,  i was not sure about if this windshield mounting bracket was going to stay in place while i drive trough the streets .  however ,  i was very surprised when i found out that the bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another ,  even under some vibration .  the suction rubber system is quite strong .  it has 2 angles for adjustment ,  and you can rotate the gps clockwise/counterclockwise .pros :  strong suction rubber system ,  gps mounting systemcons :  lack of a 4th angle for adjustment  ( the gps can only be adjusted in the windshield plane ,  so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that's why i give 4 stars
i'm using monster optical cable as well ,  but with different reasons behind .  anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from  magnetic field or emf
i had to 'fix' this ipod holder with a bicycle hand grip to stop it from shaking my ipod .  i have a decent car and the roads are just ok but this thing shakes and shakes .  i also put one of those beer coolers around the base of the foam hand grip and its now rock solid .  oh yeah and it holds the ipod just right too .  i also put some of those velcro dots on the bottom for a little more security from my cup holder
it is remarkable that ,  even though there are hundreds of ipod cases in existence ,  none of them are near-perfect .   i tried four different cases ,  both hard plastic and silicone variants ,  and the iskin case comes the closest ,  protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use .the case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone .   the ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve ,  which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen .   in addition ,  there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case ,  and this provides the screen protection .   due to the double-seam in the silicone ,  the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod ,  so you don't have to worry about it scratching .the case even has a flap that covers the dock connector ,  preventing dust from entering ,  yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case .the most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel ,  but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling .   actually ,  i think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel .the only real downside i found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--i would not trust it at all ,  so i took it off .   it would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use ,  and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well ,  but as i said above ,  i have yet to find a perfect ipod case .   like most silicone cases ,  this one does also attract lint in your pockets ,  etc .  ,  but it is not as bad as other cases .unfortunately ,  even though this is a great case ,  it is not readily available .   i couldn't find it in any store ,  and amazon only sells it through marketplace sellers .   i ordered from applelinks ,  and they delivered it to me in four days .   whatever you do ,  don't order from the iskin company directly .   i have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases .   they should re-dedicate themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them
these are the only earphones worth buying for your ipod .  i tried to get some cheapies after i lost my originals ,  but they were horrible .  these are a little expensicve ,  but so worth it .i don't use the pause/skip attachment thing though .  it makes the cord too long
i can't believe the unbelievable prices of flash drives these days .   i just bought this one from wal-mart for $20 . 00 dollars .   that's way cheaper than on amazon . com .   plus i've noticed that amazon . com has switched to third retailers and some don't even ship to hawaii ,  or do ship to hawaii at a hefty price .   this switching of amazon having the lowest price to third retailers is really turning me off .   possibly even towards purchasing books .
i had originally bought a linksys ,  without doing any research beforehand .  .  .  thinking all routers were more or less equal .  .  .  oops !  hardware was poor ,  the interface was wonky ,  customer service was a joke .  i was re-booting it every few minutes under moderate usage ,  because it keep dropping my dsl connection or completely locking up .  i just replaced it with a dgl-4300 based on all the positive reviews ,  and have been very happy so far .  i don't need or use any of the advanced features for gaming ;  but already i've been very impressed with the dgl-4300 since it hasn't dropped any connections since i bought it last week .  you get what you pay for
this was the least expensive 1 gb memory card i have ever seen and it works as well as it should
this little device is a great invention from hp .   i had problems installing the unit and was on the telephone with hp tech support  ( india )  for 1 . 75 hours ,  i spent very little time on hold .the largest draw back to the unit is my computer acts like the dc4000 is not there from time to time and required me to reboot the computer in order to use this nifty device
the quality of materials :  zipper ,  hard case ,  strap and lightweight are outstanding .  when i connected my mp3 player ,  thesound was impressive for a-carry along- portable stereo speaker .next ,  i took the mp3 out of the speaker case and loaded my dt200v pocket radio ;  again the sound was very good and even loudat a low volume setting .now the minor negatives :  changing the volume ,  etc .requires going into the zipped case .other than the ipod ,  be careful inselecting this speaker .  the player ,  radio .  .  .  cannot bemore than 4 "  high ,  2 . 5 "  wide and  . 75 "  thick ;larger and you may not be able to zip closedthe speaker case ,  which is necessary .my items just do fit .  so the quality soundand materials make this a fine product ,especially for the money .other products reviews have greatly helped medecide what to buy ,  this is why i did this review .please do the same for others as you buy products .
protects the garmin's 60 screen from scratches ,  but interferes with the button operations a little .  worth the hassle to protect the screen
this card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use .512 mb is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 mb or less camera ,  assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time .   with the 1200x1600p setting i use on my camera most often ,  this card holds over 400 photos ,  and it will hold even more for those using a more email-friendly setting .   do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you ,  but i've had no problems with sandisk products
sandisk has done it again .   they never seem to let me down with their products .   i was in the market for another memory chip since i kept filling up my smaller 128 mb chip .   the price was the deciding factor for me ,  as being a college student the financial situation was tight .   but this product was perfect ,  right price ,  excellecnt storage space ,  good name .   get this product if you need more space for your digital camera
i've had this photo printer a few weeks now .   i don't consider myself technically proficient .   i totally scored despite gross ignorance with this machine .   you cannot go wrong .   the photo quality is astonishing .   i've printed professional quality photos and framed them .   the results are fantastic .   for someone who is techno-challenged ,  i had this up and running very quickly
this was easy to set-up and use .  it receives the signal from the router in all the rooms in my house
i decided to replace my iriver 190t after a 3rd party cable adapter malfunctioned and fused the pin connection to the usb cable together .   i wanted usb 2 . 0 for the faster connection and a larger capacity ,  but still desired standard user replaceable batteries on a flash based player so i picked this up on sale .i may still search for a used iriver 190t after playing with the lyra rd2315 .   i like the ruggedness of the 190t a bit more than the rca lyra rd2315 .pros :user replaceable aaa batteriesexpandable sd slot up to 512 mbdecent sound for biking and general yard workscreen is able to be positioned at 0 or 180 degrees for easy reading from belt clip/lanyardline in recording and voice for short memos3 different color backlights for user preferencedecent battery lifecons :headphones are worthless .   placing them in ear prevents clips from holding them in placeslow reaction on interface compared to older iriver player  " please wait .  .  .  "belt clip is going to break after minimal usage  ( like ink pen cap clips do )doesn't seem like usb 2 . 0 speed ,  just normal usb 1 . 1no armband or case availablei used firmware 3 . 11 for my testing after upgrading from version 1 . 11
definitely recommend this memory card ,  download time is great  .   .
it has some very useful addition from the previous model .   it has cut the time of doing my homework in half
i type medical reports for a living ,  up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week .  without the wrist rest ,  my wrists would not be able to hold up .  the wrist rest is the perfect size .  it stays in place on the desk .  the gel continues to be supportive ,  even after a year of working on it .  the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell .  i can't smell it while typing ,  only when i pick it up for cleaning .  i wish there was the option for half stars - i'd give this 4-1/2 stars
i bought this laptop stand when i found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so i could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them .   so now i have the center of the screens at the same height ,  side-by-side .   it is really nice to have twice the screen real-estate .i figured that mostly i would put background stuff on the laptop screen  ( like email )  and use my big hi-resolution screen for what i was activly working on .   but ,  now that the laptop screen is up at eye level ,  i tend to use it just as often as the big monitor !   it turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it ,  even though i was not aware of that until i got it raised .
this unit works very well and we are very pleased with it .  nice construction ,  good sound quality on both ends .  we're concerned about battery life as in # of recharges before performance decreases ,  but no indication right now that is an issue .  i would have give the product 5 stars if it had been cheaper .  this class of device is overpriced in general .  amazon's price was very good ,  but overall still seems over priced .  i would definately buy another from amazon as these are 25% more at other places .
i previously owned the 1gb lexar 40x cf card and thought that was the fastest a cf could get .  i was completely wrong .  this card is one fast sucker ,  and it can hold an enormous amount of images .  in jpeg mode i am able to store over 1000 images .  in raw mode ,  which i'm converting to thanks to this large capacity card ,  i am able to hold 444 images all on my 20d !  !  !  if your thinking of buying this card ,  don't hesitate .  it is one awsome piece of equipment ,  and one heck of an investment !  !
i have the quest 2 ,  but i've heard that this also fits the quest .  i bought it because ,  while my dell laptop backpack is well padded ,  i wanted to make sure that my quest 2 gps was protected  " just in case "  .  this case fits perfectly ,  literally like a glove .  when i got it ,  i was sceptical ;  it looked to small ,  but i was wrong ;  the dimensions are perfect .  and there is more than enough padding to protect the gps from harm ,  yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket ,  which i sometimes have to  ( late day meetings where i leave my backpack at work )  .  all in all ,  it's another great product from garmin
we bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago .   one handset gave us problems from the start ,  but was promptly replaced when returned for service .   the system works fine in our 2-story ,  2 , 300 sq .  ft .  home .   i did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house .   as a test i took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street .   i like the features ,  including paging system ,  call transfer ,  and handset speakerphone .   being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus .   i think the sound quality is very good ,  and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive .   i agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag .overall i feel it works as advertised ,  and we'll be using it for a long time
i wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days .the mouse is very good ,  a tad small ,  but still very comfortable .  not as good as  logitech� mx ( tm ) 500 for my hand  ( i'd say i have a medium size hand )  ,  but still a very solid product .  side buttons are very useful .  no need to install any additional drivers for xp if you are ok with the default behavior .  just plug it in and use .the keyboard is so-so .  it is not bad ,  but just not very comfortable ,  especially compared to microsoft keyboards .   ( i use microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines )  .  the labeling is very small ,  insert/delete keys are not standard and i hate vista ready button ,  if you hit it in the middle of the game you are lucky not to crash .would i buy it again ?  yes .  would i recommend it ?  yes ,  but with some reservations .
we have a trackman corded model and loved it so i got this one for my work computer .   it works just as well as the corded one when i'm in my office .   for travel ,  the part you plug in is a little bulky so i usually leave it at home when i travel .   it's not a small ,  usb stick that goes in the back .   it's a long ,  corded ,  mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the trackman .   i don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a usb stick instead of the other for travel .   all that said ,  i love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me
i was devout in my belief that i could get similar photo output from my canon s800 with less expensive paper .   i bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of kodak's photo quality glossy from costco .   my prints were blotchy .   then i got my hands on some of canon's photo paper pro ,  and my pictures were magically crystal clear .   the difference is amazing .   i never would've thought paper would make this much difference .   i've since bought canon's 15 sheet packs multiple times .   i now use the kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don't care much about the quality of the output ,  while i save the canon photo paper pro for prints we want to frame
wish the unit had a separate online/offline light .   when power to the unit is missing ,  the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds .   the warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it isn't always easy to tell what is happening
i just recently move from dial-up to dsl .  going dsl was not enough ;  i did not want to have cables running though the house so i started looking into going wireless .  to make a long story short ,  after a little investigation i decided to make the leap into wireless technology .  i purchased the wap55ag router and the adapter cards ,  wmp55ag and wpc55ag .once the wap55ag router was installed and set up ,  the installation of the wmp55ag pci adapter on each of the desktops were simple .i had no difficulty setting up the hardware and software and with a few hours ,  i was on the net through the router .  one desktop is running xp professional and the other desktops are running xp home edition .the linksys web site has all the documentation you need for installation and setup .  there is a  " knowledge base "  page that covers a lot of the products and answers to a lot of questions about various products and configurations ;  i found it to be very helpful .pulled from linksys web site :----------------------------------------the linksys dual-band wireless a+g pci adapter installs in most desktops and lets you put your computer almost anywhere in the building ,  without the cost and hassle of running network cables .  now you don't have to drill holes in your walls and climb through the attic or cellar to get connected to the network .  once you're connected ,  you can keep in touch with your e-mail ;  access the internet ,  use instant messaging to chat with friends ,  and share files and other resources such as printers and network storage with other computers on the network .the dual-band wireless a+g pci adapter connects you with wireless-a  ( 802 . 11a )  and wireless-g  ( draft 802 . 11g )  networks at an incredible 54mbps !  and for added versatility ,  it can also interoperate with all the 11mbps wireless-b  ( 802 . 11b )  products found in homes ,  businesses ,  and public wireless hotspots around the country .  and whichever mode you choose ,  your wireless communications are protected by up to 152-bit encryption ,  so your data stays secure .features of the product :--------------------------------one adapter connects to either 2 . 4 ghz  ( 802 . 11b or draft 802 . 11g )  or 5 ghz  ( 802 . 11a )  networksadvanced security features with up to 152-bit wep encryptiondetailed monitoring and performance utilityieee 802 . 11a ,  802 . 11b and draft 802 . 11g compliantsystem requirements  ( minimum )  :---------------------------------------------200mhz of faster processor64mb ramavailable pci slotcd-rom drivewindows 98se ,  me ,  2000 or x
our new vcr/dvd player is wonderful .  set up was easy and i am even able to record-- something that the set-up configuration on my last model was unable to do .  delivery was even faster than expected !  quality is teriffic and price was reasonable
i was really pushing the limits of my mid-range monster surge protector with 2 tvs ,  a 2 . 4gig p4 with desktop tv ,  dsl ,  two printers ,  and  .  .  .  .  . drumroll please .  .  .  .  . a fridge all crammmed into a  corner office setup about 7' wide .  the belkin gold unit with rf/emi suppression up to 75db cured all the rattle and hum problems with speakers ,  satellite signal ,  the  " dirty "  line into my modem ,  and a week later i haven't had to reboot my system once .  amazing !i had already had a great experience with a belkin surgemaster on my home theater setup ,  so i went one level up with this  " gold "  unit .  one of the better investments i've made lately .  i paid $60 at the local office depot ,  the price amazon is advertising is ridiculously low at $35 .  belkin . com's price is about $70 so my advice is to buy this unit now before somebody at amazon wakes up  and jacks the price .
i bought this for my kids to use with nascar racing .   controls are easily reprogramable .   nice product for the money
i bought this from amazon for $15 and it works great with my car audio .it is easy to use and working fine till now .  the audio quality is decent and surely recommend this
besides all opion regarding this new calculator ,  i would like to say ,  it is very nice ,  good design ,  options ,  features ,  a huge screen and modern color .  so far ,  i haven't navigate deep inside it ,  it is not similar as 48gx ,  so you've got to expend some time to know how to use it .  i bought it since there is not a better calculator than this  ( 48gx is unique but obsolete
the den of horrors that is the magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord .  if you don't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your gps and that is no fun at all .i have used mine for over six months and it works without a hitch .  a nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you don't have excess cordage lying around your dashboard .  right now i loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again i never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism .  others may run into this problem .  the alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles .  a minor hitch but not earthshaking .
i have had mine for a week .  i had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years ,  which was misplaced .  i bought the navigation kit at the same time i ordered a 60 cs .  it makes what i bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies .  i had no problems loading software and maps ,  upload or download from/to my gps .i am impressed by the softwares ability to  " recalculate "  in navigation mode .  if i ignore the suggested route ,  it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where i am .i am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc .  are concerned but i am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained .  i have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example  ( to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane )  ,  and knowledge of one-way streets etc .the real test is yet to come to negotiate san francisco's endless no left turns ,  one way streets ,  construction and limited freeway on ramps !  !
i tried both microsoft's lifecam vx-3000 and vx-6000 .  had 'em both home and ran trials with my intel pentium d dual core 3 . 00ghz cpu with 2 gigs of ram and ,  with both of those ,  the video lagged the audio  ( distractingly so )  .  spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly microsoft customer service rep one evening  ( got through on their toll free line ) and he pointed me to new software for the vx-6000 .  downloaded the 50 meg plus file ,  installed it ,  but the vx-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs .  audio when i created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on media player or editing in windows movie maker .so ,  i talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my ,  i believe ,  excellent computer .  all recommended logitech when buying webcams .  i then marched back to best buy and traded my $99 microsoft vx-6000 for a logitech quickcam orbit mp for bb's price of $139 . 95 .  you can find this logitech unit cheaper all over the place ,  including ,  of course ,  here at amazon .  the package i bought included an inexpensive headset ,  which i haven't used so far .although i haven't tried the orbit in a video phone call yet ,  from the moment i turned it on i had that satisfing good feeling that i bought a winner .  installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps .  got a  " usb composite device has not passed windows logo testing "  screen a couple of times .  . but .  . i received the same screen on ,  get this ,  the microsoft cams !  i just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far .the audio sync with video in making a recording is right on  ( remember ,  that was primary reason for taking back the microsoft cameras )  and the picture clarity on my lcd flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture .  excellent detail and smoothness of video .  besides the superior audio sync with video ,  the orbit mp is remarkably better than the vx-6000 and way above the $49 microsoft vx-3000 in all other criteria too ,  in my opinion after comparison testing .the orbit's special effects are interesting and fun .  the pan ,  tilt ,  etc .  ,  excellent .  the face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little orbit camera turn - but i haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet .all in all - for webcams ,  i'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for logitech .  they've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance .  the orbit mp is a keeper !  not going to waste anymore time searching and testing .  and ,  my advice to microsoft ,  you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those lifecams .  i've relied on the microsoft name on peripherals ,  keyboards ,  etc .  ,  and i've generally been very satisfied .  but ,  in webcams ,  with me ,  the microsoft brand now takes a back seat to logitech .
i bought this recorder to use as backup for real-time event video recording .   i have also used it concert settings .   the record quality is astounding ,  full range of dynamics ,  using both the stereo mini-plug input and the 1/4 "  inputs .   it is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio .   first thing i did was to upgrade to a 4gb compactflash card .   the provided card is too limited .battery life is adequate for hour plus recordings ,  and connection and downloading to pc is a breeze .   the wav files are really high quality .it all works as advertised .   the only minor glitch i have had ,  is that when you first try to start a recording ,  it gives a  " media full "  message ,  even tho the media is empty .   then you select record again and it records just fine .   i went several iterations with tech support ,  who were very friendly and helpful ,  but the problem has not been resolved .   i also suspect the 3rd part flash card may be contributing to this glitch .   i would buy this recorder again
i bought these speakers based on price because i just wanted to get some budget speakers to start off with on my home theater .   it turns out that these speakers have amazing sound quality easily rivaling speakers that cost 10x the price .i really can't find one bad thing to say .   even at high volumes they have a crystal clear pristine sound .   the sub woofer pumps a nice rich heavy bass .  take advantage of the low price on these speakers ,  you won't find a better deal .i'm using these speakers with a harman kardon avr 240 receiver and i also have two polk r15's as my front left and right
these cables are super with my new dvd player .  there is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment .  the picture is soo clear ,  and vivid .  the cables themselves are really made well ,  they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt .  if you get these monster cables you won't be sorry
i've had 2 other fm transmitters  ( a belkin and a griffin itrip )  .  neither came close to the quality of this transmitter .  neither charged the ipod  ( the belkin required batteries ,  which only lasted about 15 hours of use )  ,  while the itrip worked ok at first ,  but then started getting static no matter what station i used .  in fact ,  i had to have the ipod in hand for the static to go away  ( and then ,  it was still not clear )  .  the sound isn't as loud as some  ( it takes over the volume control ,  so you cant use the volume on the ipod .  )  still ,  it's not nearly as soft as some i've seen .  i found most music came through at a good volume  ( i did adjust a few songs in itunes to pump them up )  .  this unit ,  although it seems cheap and flimsy at first ,  is able to get a consistant ,  strong signal ,  even on stations which usually come in clearly .  it powers through them ,  and the result is a very clean sound .  it is a little hard to read at the regular angle ,  but once you set the 3 presets ,  you don't need to see the screen .  just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration .  also ,  turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer .  in all ,  i couldn't be happier
( despite some of the negative reviews of this item ,  it continues to perform well with my regular-sized ipod .   in fact ,  it has more volume ,  depth ,  and presence than three other portable speakers--each costing 50 to 75% more--to which i've compared it .   the only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage-free from amazon ,  diminishing its  " bargain "  appeal somewhat .  )these modest-sized and priced speakers perform as advertised :  the sound is more than adequate ;  they're small enough that i can take the stephen colbert report  with me on walks ;  when not in use ,  they fold up into a mini porta-john .  my only misgiving is whether i should have spent 2-3x more for a unit with a dock connector .  but for under twenty bucks you simply won't find a better sounding ,  more compact unit
easy to operate and good focus .  just a little problem with tracking for the goofy faces but overall a nice little cam
the best headphones i ever had ,  good fit excellent sound on my soundblaster x-fi !  !
it works great !   i really like it .   there is one small problem though .   the lid is really hard to take off !   i've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little ,  but not much .   there has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on ,  but isn't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it .   i appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion
i am amazed by the quality of the guitar .  the product is extremely good .  the service by amazon was ultimate .  thanks a lot amazon
i found out the way to copy photos from my compactflash card onto the ipaq .  it's not hard but more complex than necessary .  i also found out how to send the ipaq in to have its screen replaced .  a hassle .  its screen and/or stylus should work together so they don't produce scratches in the first place
noel lee's monster cable products inc .  ,  come up with the goods here !  a cable of stunning ,  high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you'll think you're watching scenes through a glass window and not through a television/monitor ,  a bold claim indeed ,  but ,  quite true never-the-less .  i was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better .  this cable brings to the viewer all the picture ,  and ,  yes ,  that does mean  " warts and all " so ,  be prepared to see the smallest of detail ,  like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work  " un-seen "  .  who really needs hdtv when cables like monster's mvs3-1m are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing television/monitor for only a minute fraction of the cost .  thanks noel ,  well done
panasonic makes good quality products and this is no exception .   easy to use ,  very compact ,  no interference with cordless usage
i don't get why other mounts cost twice as much .   i bought this to hang my 42 "  panasonic and it is great .   can someone tell me why the omnimount costs so much more ?   i don't see any  " functionality "  differences .   and with the mustang tilt mount ,  i have been tilting it at least 10 times for either adjustments or disconnecting/reconnecting cables .  .  . it is so simple
i recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at ebay 2 pairs of jbl e20s and 1 pair e30s ,  an e25 center speaker and a harmon kardon avr .  i got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of e20s and the e30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend .the e20s and e30s are listed as  " bookshelf speakers .  "  the e20s are bookshelf speakers .  as i wrote in my review of the e20s ,  the e30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is kong and your first name is king !  the e20s are heavy at 7lbs each ,  not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are .  the e30s are heavy .  heavy !  16 lbs each .   ( that is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs !  )  they are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep .  they need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor .i am very pleased with both the e20s and e30s .  for small speakers ,  the e20s have some oomph and can be cranked up .  the e30s have ooommphhhh .  they want to be cranked up .  yesterday i tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the animals singles and paul revere and the raiders kicks .  when cranked up ,  the e30s sound at least 1000% better than the the e20s .   i hooked them up to my vintage jvc av receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power .  at a little over half volume my ears began to hurt .  you can really feel the bass and the drums kick .i also listened to about 2 hours of the doors via rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver .  i have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s .  the e30s are simply incredible !  they brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh .my biggest surprise with the e30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes ,  not as good as the e20s ,  but still very good .  as i write ,  i am watching/listening to a dvd of vivaldi's 4 seasons concertos performed by herbert von karajan ,  the bpo and anne-sophie mutter on fiddle and am running the e30s and e20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver .  yet i can still hear everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord .  since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels ,  i am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums .i bought the e30s for under $90 including s/h .  back in the early 80s or late 70s i spent more than four times this amount  ( adjusted for inflation )  for 2 large ,  heavy advent loudspeakers with 8 "  woofers .  the e30s clearly sound better than i ever remember the advents sounding including better bass response ,  and i liked the advents !  over time ,  our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper .  you still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10 , 000 mcintosh system  ( or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as i saw at one website !  )  it all depends on what your budget is .  the jbls are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded
at first ,  the keyboard looked cheap and  the keys were in slightly different places than normal ,  but after time ,  i got used to the layout ,  and found that the keys actually work surprisingly smooth .   it probably helped my game a bit .   the extra bit on the front of the board did break off after 2 weeks ,  but i didn't like using it anyway
i have only had this monitor for a couple of day'sbut i am verry happy with it .  it came well packaged and you cant beat the price .  i shopped around and this was the one for me .i dont know about the other review but with in 5 min of opening the box i was using the monitor and it worked verry well !  !thank's amazon
this was a breeze to setup ,  even with wpa2 to ensure privacy .   i also hooked up an xbox360 and it has never failed in since i bought it about 6 month ago .much better value then your average gaming adaptor since it has multiple ports so you can hook up all your gizmos at the entertainment center rather then buying a wireless adaptor for each  ( i . e .  tivo ,  ps2 ,  etc .  .  .  )i love it ,  and for the price ,  you could not beat it .
the antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the gps units internal antenna .  this easily solved the issue of poor reception when the gps is inside of a car ;  however ,  the best accuracy i am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs .  the 9 feet using the gps's internal antenna when in an open area .   garmin's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around  ( on my gps )  .   i feel the antenna was worth purchasing
i use my usb hub every day and it works fine with every device i plug into it
this is my second purchase of these speakers . they provide great sound especially for the price . my kids use them with their computers and ipods . i recommend them to everyone
not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture .  you wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing .  i have shown it to an i-pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the i-pod .the unit is not perfect ,  it does freeze occasionally ,  but the re-set function has always unlocked it .  the video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also .  but the conversion software was able to handle very large files .  i suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions .sound quality is great .  combine this with sennheiser cx300-b earbuds and you'll love it .this is my forth mp3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product .  the previous player ,  creative zen nano plus 1 gb mp3 ,  quit working the week the warranty ran out .thumbs up on this one
these speakers are not what i had expected from their size ,  price ,  and looks .   their quality ,  even at high volumes ,  exceeds many other speakers i've seen at double the price tag .   the reason i bought these was because of the other reviews and the size .   another reason was the proposed battery life ,  35 hours on 4 aaa batteries ,  not bad at all .   so far its been very close .   i have heard the other speaker  ( systems )  and yes the jbl onstage and the bose sounddock are both very good and do live up to their reputations ,  but your stuck with using them only when there is an outlet nearby
i have owned many sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now .  the only problem i have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory ,  you run out when you need it most .  that is why i upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the sony 1 gig .  actually i carry a spare 1 gig too where ever i go .look ,  when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size  ( 3-6 megapixels )  per picture ,  which you should always do to get the best possible prints made ,  your camera will need a ton of storage space .   especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn't expected like a wildfire ,  a plane crash ,  a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens .  you can always  " resize "  you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space .  trust me ,  take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected .you never know .  i have tons of pictures that people ask how did i ever get such good pictures of such amazing things .  i have a helicopter crash ,  police car up a power poll ,  deer in downtown oakland ,  house fire before the fire dept got there ,  tons of wild animals ,  any many more things i saw while i was driving somewhere or walking in a park .  if you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives !matching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea .  no problems ever !  !  the sony memory sticks i have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems .  they make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer .  they are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable .  i have first hand knowledge that products with the sony name on it are first rate and high quality .  if you want quality buy sony

at such low price ,  this player is really pretty good .it gets the job done ,  even though the ui is a little bit basic .it can record in dvd+r and dvd-r ,  and has a 10 hour mode .   although in the 10 hour mode ,  image is not so clear but still pretty good if view on the computer using 320 x 240 resolution .and at such a low price ,  you can get two or three to record different programs and archive some shows ,  and it is still cheaper than the media center pc .   good thing is the disc is already a dvd playable in any player .   no need to burn it as opposed to if you are using tivo or media center pc .
i have had this phone now about 3 months and i am very happy with it .  it has all the things and want and many more ,  the hand sets are very clear and i love the fact i can check voice mail on any hand set that goes with it i do not have to run to the main answering machine to check the voice mail .  the range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this .   so far i love everything with this phone ,  it is much better than either of the last two phone i have had .  i have walked over a 1/2 block from the house and it still works clearly ,  i have never had a phone that worked so far away from home
i picked up 4 pairs of these on amazon ,  and have applied the ca and nylon tape fix to the first pair  ( took about 10 minutes to do ,  let it cure overnight )  .   headphones look ok ,  with just the right amount of geekhood proudly announced afterwards  ( reminiscent of the last generation of geeks with the tape on the glasses )  .   sound is very good  ( better than most earbuds )  ,  they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated logitech transiever ,  and range is outstanding .   my only beef is how long i have to hold down the power switch to turn them on ,  and so far i have not successfully established a connections with my treo 650 .   1 star held back because of need of customer applied eco ,  and they are only partially functional with the nano  ( can't use the advance track feature of the headphones )
after having used crts roughly the size of small cars for my entire life ,  i finally jumped on the lcd-flatscreen bandwagon .  this acer 19 "  lcd makes me happy i did !mostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color ,  brightness ,  and size of the screen really matters to me .  this monitor really nails all three of those areas .  it provides vivid ,  crisp colors ;  it doesn't wash out the picture with super-brightness  ( what my old monitor did )  ,  nor is its display too dark to catch the action ;  and the 19 "  screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size
these are some great headphones with a few minor flaws :pros :1 .  great sound quality2 .  very comfortable3 .  light4 .  worry-free chargingcons :1 .  achieving good wireless connection is not always easy ,  could require pressing the tune-in button several times2 .  interference noises could sneak into the broadcast3 .  turning them off could be annoying  ( requires precise timing )my experience :  i've had two pairs of these for over a year and i like them very much .  i enjoy great sound watching tv or listening to music while everybody is asleep .  this is really great ,  i can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night .  the sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the tv .  you have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the tv  ( closet or the garage for example )  .  the headphones are light and very comfortable .  i tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far .  so ,  overall wonderful product .  however ,  there a few flaws to be aware of .  consider the following before buying .  it might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel .  sometimes ,  turning the headphones on results in poor reception if any at all .  to correct this ,  you have to press the only button  ( power ,  search ,  and turn off )  and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel .  you might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying .  once you get good reception ,  everything is ok although you might get some interference  ( alien noises )  when you turn your head or move around .  the last problem is with the turn off button  ( again the only multifunction button )  .  you need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit .  that is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on .  you think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely .  well ,  i hope my description is helpful .regardless of the flaws ,  i recommend the aw771 .  i use them every day and best of all i enjoy great sound when other people are asleep .
i bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them ,  and i agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat ,  uncolored sound with tight ,  but not boomy ,  or overpowering bass .  by the way ,  i've owned the sony mdr-v600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these ,  but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications ,  but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion .  these have been used by musicians ,  studio engineers ,  and on air talent for 20 years now
this tv weighs a ton ,  took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire .  i have owned several sony tvs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that i have had with a 27&quot ;  sony .  mainly compared this model with the corresponding panasonic tau ,  absolutely hated the tau remote and am very familiar with the sony .  note that the remote was not the deciding criteria ,  but it was a consideration .  i have no real complaints about this tv ,  the menu system is nice and the picture very good .  i do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound .  this tv has a 16 : 9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus ,  i tried it once using a dvd as source input and liked the widescreen format that the dvd player provides better than the 16 : 9 mode .  the 27&quot ;  sony that i have has an auto-volume feature ,  this 36&quot ;  does not and i do miss it .  i would purchase this unit again .  note that there is a very similar sony model that has upgraded sound ,  but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire
these are the best .  period !  look no further .  .  because you will not find a better value in rechargable batteries
first time i heard these i was floored by the output .   nice high ,  mid and low bass sounds no matter what you have going thru them be it music ,  games or movies .   definately worth the low low price .  .  .first person wwii shooter games like call of duty sound awesome with these speaker
works as advertised ,  have not had a single problem with it since installing it in my tungsten t
no problems w/ the phone .  there is no mute button and it's annoying to hit two buttons to mute/unmute .  i also couldn't find a way to change ringer volume but it's easy to change the ringer melody and there is one that's really soft .the menu is not as intuitive as it could be but overall it works just fine as a phone .
couldn't get any sw stations ,  but am and fm worked great and the hand crank charged up the cell phone ,  after a lot of cranking
received it pretty quick ,  but it was sdsdqu-1024-e10m .   there isn't any difference just it comes from europe instead of the u . s .  that was pretty odd but otherwise it works
i like it very much ,  i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather .  i would buy kingston again
i have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of memorex and so far i have not had any problems .  they work just fine on my sony dvd burner
gave as a gift .  excellent value .  tune capacity more than sufficient ,  easy to use and sound quality is right up there .  must get one for myself
i just use the keyboard like a business user .  i don't use the media stuff .  i really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works .  i like that it's not huge and doesn't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that i never use .  the rechargeable mouse is handy as well .  prior to this ,  i had two microsoft wireless combos in a row ,  and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me .  i don't know if it's because it's logitech or it's bluetooth ,  but the keyboard/mouse are as responsive as were they wired  ( after they  " wake up "  )  .
great product .  it's two in one .  you have it in your camera and take photos ,  next you can plug it into the usb port and download data .  it's worth the money
if you went to circuit city ,  you would see this is $30 there .  here its only 8 . 99 !  with fast shipping i only paid about $16 total ,  half the price of circuit city .  those type of stores  ( best buy ,  circuit city ,  compusa )  are a total ripoff when it comes to these cables .  buy from amazon . com  ( eektech will ship )  and you save lots of $$ .  thanks eek for great service
i don't think i would have used my i5 without this .  i just wish it came with the gps instead of having to buy it separately .  great to easily move my gps from car to car .  highly recommend
my experince shows that it is always better to use paper from the same brand as your printer .  then the result is really outstanding print after print .  the paper is really top quality and regardless of your needs it will satisfy them .  bravo canon for this first class product
a very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer .  the reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is  utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently
i think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable .   mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where i can get an open computer .   i have w2k at home with usb 1 and xp pro at work with usb 2 .   never had any type of compatibility issue .   this 128 mb size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion .   i plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon .the amazing this is that i have just removed my usb drive from a clean pair of pants that went through the wash and dry cycle .   and this was the second time .   i can't believe it still works .maybe i'll have to start using that ridiculus cord and wear it around my neck .through away your zip and floppy disks and get one of these things .   just make sure you back it up often
i bought these earbuds for the first time 3 years ago for $15 now u can get them for under $10 they last more than six months of hard wear and tear  before they need replacing awsome i've been using them for a long time and don't plan on changin
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time .  i have tried backpacks ,  shoulder bags ,  duffel bags ,  but none of them really worked all that well .  then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches ,  vests ,  belts ,  and accessories .  it works great ,  you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used  ( put frequently used items in easier to access places .  )the variety alone of this system is worth the investment ,  but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus .  you can get a case for any lens ,  camera body ,  or accessory you have .  i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle .  one word of caution ,  be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch ,  because sometimes the lens will fit ,  but then the lens with the lens hood will not .  i often carry 5-6 lenses ,  extension tubes ,  teleconverters ,  extra memory cards and batteries ,  and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets ,  which weights a ton .  but when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt lowepro system it is actually very manageable .the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body .  but if you can overlook that ,  this is the way to go .  i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems ,  in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses .  many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed .  you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment ,  which is nice .  i really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment ,  if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution ,  consider this ,  you won't regret it .

i've had this keyboard a number of years and would never go back to anything else .  i have  ( or had )  severe carpal tunnel syndrom .  this keyboard has eliminated that problem entirely .  i can't think of a downside .  yes ,  it takes a bit of getting used to and yes ,  the keys are a bit noisy .  but i have no problem with that .  it just reminds me i'm working .the number pad is excellent too .i'm getting ready to get another one to use with my laptop .you can't destroy this keyboard .  if you value your wrists and hands ,  get this
i love belkin and their surge protectors are top quality .  i specifically look for their brand and i am always very impressed .  this model has been especially good to me over the last 3 years and i would highly recommend it
i do not have a hearing problem ,  but my previous cordless phones were inaudible even at high volume .  .  this phone fills the bill -- at least so far !   the only caveat :  no speakerphone ,  which would be handy considering the amount of time most of us spend on hold .
okay so it was about 8 : 45 at night .  i was coming on to a 1/2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where i live .  i was doing 60mph ,  the speed limit is 40 .  as i start to approach the bridge i start getting a small k-band warning .  i instantly slow down to the speed limit .  as i start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so i slow down even more to 35 mph .  then it gets to full k-band .  i look to my left where there is a service parking area ,  and in the pitch dark i see the reflectors of the one and only crown vic police car .  as i pass the police car ,  i start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead .if i didn't have this detector he would have gotten me doing 20 over the limit .  thank you escort !
after having two sandisk card readers ,  and one lacie card reader die on me ,  i invested in this lexar card reader .  for the money ,  it has worked flawlessy with pro compact flash cards up to 4gb in size .  i am very impressed with the transfer speeds ,  and the unit is not too big for traveling .  the door that covers the slot ,  however ,  is very flimsy and easily deattaches  ( but fortunately easily reattaches too ?  )  i use mac os x 10 . 4 . 8 and it works just fine .  i also used it with windows xp without any installation or transfer issues
i bought one of these to replace the standard 32mb card that came with my camera .  wow ,  now i can store a ton of pictures .  the price on the ep memory cards are awesome too
this stand works great for bringing the monitor up to eye level .  if you want to sit comfortably .  .  . get rid of back and neck strain .  .  . this targus stand is definately the way to go .  and .  .  . the price is right
these speakers were purchased for office use and occasionally for on the road .   they are a great look and compact .   the sound is decent and should not be confused with higher end speakers .   they serve the purpose for which they were intended as far as i am concerned as i purchased them to play my nano i-pod .   i do recommend them .
the gps works in both my dell axim x5 and in my hp compaq nc6000 with a compact flash adapter card .   i have used it with ms streets and trips and arcpad
i bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk .  .  . i was totally wrong !  !  !  these are great ,  they give the bass right where you want it .  sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much .  watch out these come on sale instores for around $8 . 00 sometimes .  that's where i got my 1st pair
bought this for my son who is in iraq .  he doesn't leave his tent w/o it !  !stands up fine to the dust and heat with no problem .  has more room than he expected .  the price was less than the smaller one he wanted from a competitor to amazon . com .so glad i found this one on amazon instead
this was my second dlo transpod .  i had an older white one that i bought used .  i figured i would  " upgrade "  to this one since my ipod and my car's interior are black .  overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one ,  but with a few little changes .for one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts .  that normally doesn't matter if you choose a good empty frequency ,  but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect .next ,  i can't turn it up any where near the volume i used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static .  it seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it .last ,  the most annoying part of this whole product ,  is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use .  i have paused my ipod to take a phone call only to have very loud  ( since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume )  static and sometimes radio stations coming through .  very embarrassing .  or when you stop your car and then come back ,  as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise .since my car doesn't leave me many options for stereo replacement ,  this is the best product for my specific situation ,  though i may try and get that old one back from my friend .  .  . maybe an  " upgrade "  to a newer one will settle the deal
for the most part i just want to keep it short .   i usually always by energizer cause they're reasonably priced and seem to last much much longer then most other battery products that i have used in the past
there is absolutely nothing that we don't like about these panasonic phones .   the sound quality is excellent as is the range .   very happy customers
i use the drive to back up important data .  i write a few gb to the drive each time .  i was surprise by how fast data transfered onto the hard drive through the usb2 . 0 interface .  it is quiet and i have no complain
i recently purchased a pny 512 mb secure digital card from best buy when it was on sale for $29 . 99 each card .  i had been given a sandisk 256 mb card for christmas the past year ,  which had gone curropt .  the pny is so much better and so much cheaper for virtually the same quality or better than my old sandisk .  i would recommend this product to anybody who is fed up with sandisk or any other high priced memory manufacturer .steve
this is a pretty decent cheapo case .   if you want something that you'll use every day in the car or at your dj gigs ,  then you may want to get something a little sturdier .   for my  [ archival ]  purposes ,  however ,  it works just fine
i had been talking about wanting an mp3 player ,  but i did not want an ipod ,  as i heard you cannot add files in windows format and that's what all of my music is .   i received this e260 4 gb mp3 player for my birthday in june 2006 ,  and this is the first mp3 player i have ever owned .   although there are a few little quirks ,  overall i am not disappointed and would recommend this mp3 player .like many rechargeable battery-powered items ,  it required a lengthy initial charge before first use .   after that ,  the future charges don't seem to take as long .   the mp3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge .   although i've never run it completely down ,  i have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues .i installed the software on my computer ,  and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual .   i was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual ,  and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my mp3 player froze and i had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide  ( turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it )  .it came pre-loaded with 20 songs ,  only one of which i had ever heard of  ( and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on saturday night live )  .   although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices ,  i decided to leave them on there until i need the space .   about three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months .   i currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more .as far as performance goes ,  it performs pretty well .   the buttons are a little difficult to get used to ,  as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel .   not too bad ,  but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there ,  you will be scrolling a lot .i do not use all the functions that came with this mp3 player .   it has music ,  fm radio ,  photo ,  voice ,  video and a settings option .   i have used the music function and the voice recorder option ,  both with good results .   the only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the mp3 player and onto your computer .   it would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer .   as for syncing music files ,  i have not had any problems ,  although i did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded ,  but when you try to play it ,  it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list .   i don't know what caused this .   also ,  you can only store a song as one genre ,  which is a little annoying .   be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the mp3 player ,  you cannot change the genre .it came with a headset ,  but i have never used it .   instead i purchased some panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it .i do wish the mp3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's usb drive to charge .   another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen .   i can't remember it being dropped or anything ,  so i don't know what caused this ,  but it's pretty noticeable .   it doesn't seem to affect the operation ,  just the aesthetics .overall ,  the cons are little irritations to me and i would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an ipod
i was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when i ran across these on a website .  i was a little hesitant at first because i don't think i ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones .  i finally decided to invest in these because i spend most of my free time listening to music .  i received these the other day ,  and immediately plugged them into my ipod .  please don't let the breaking in period discourage you !  after these become comfortable ,  you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time .i started with all my heavy bass tracks ,  and couldn't believe how they sounded with these headphones .  i then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded .  this is the first time in my life john coltrane has given me goosebumps !if you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you .  if you are just a casual music listener ,  i would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones ,  you will save a lot of money .  however if you are a passionate music lover and collector ,  these headphones will change your music completely .  after getting comfortable with these ,  i would have paid much more than i actually did
hp premium plus photo paper is the only way to go if you desire tremendous photos from your home printer without any scratching ,  scuffing or blemishes .  i have tried less expensive paper from hp as well as other manufacturers .  the difference in quality is obvious .  if you want friends and family to think you know what you are doing ,  share photo's on hp premium plus glossy paper .jay shahee
excellent sound from phones and microphone .  comfortable on head and ears .  plenty of cable .  on cable controls are handy .
the sound is fine ,  but the mic is not so good ,  too much background noise .  the headset is quite  " loose "  but it's ok when you get used to it .
i downloaded the driver from trendnet's website before installing the adapter .  i did not encounter any problems at all ,  including the issue that some users had with it disconnecting when they plugged in another usb device
although i could go on and on about how skype has changed my life forever ,  i will try to address the issue at hand ,  and that is the polycom communicator .   basically i love the concept of the polycom communicator !   when i first started using skype i used a usb headset that works great .   the problem is that it is a serious pita to put the thing on when someone calls because i have to either a .  try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection ,  or b .  answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord .   if i chose option a .  envariably i would miss half the calls ,  if i chose option b .  everyone would always comment that i sounded so desheveled when i tried to answer the call .   well ,  now with the new polycom communicator all i have to do is answer the call .as far as the quality and performance of the polycom communicator .  .  . that is the only reason i didn't give the item 4 stars .   it seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines .   it is really sporadic though ,  and i can't seem to reproduce it consistently .   also ,  the driver for the polycom communicator has crashed on me a couple of times .so despite the downfalls that i mentioned above ,  there is no way i could give up my polycom communicator now .   i simply love it ,  i just wish those other issues never happened
ladies and gentlemen ,just a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy 'toys' before exploring what it is that they're buying .   i have seen people knock the sandisk u3 drives ,  as well as u3 drive made by other companies .   well the reality is that :a- the u3 software has a way of stopping the software's auto-boot .b- there is uninstall software available at at sandisk . com and at u3 . com ,  and i'm guessing that those company's that offer u3 and have a web site probably have the 'uninstaller' on their site .c- there is a great deal of u3 software available  ( free and pay-for-it )  at u3 . com .   i know that sandisk has a software site ,  so do verbatim & memorex .d- for those who want portable software but don't want u3 or don't have a u3 drive ,  go to http : //portableapps . com .   note :  some of the software here is the same used by the u3 folks ,  without using the u3 launchpad .e- quality of drives :  remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys' available today ,  you are buying chinese c***  ( junk )  .   both the manufacturing and quality control  ( qc )  are garbage .   unless you are paying serious change for something  ( $500+ )  you will get passable junk .   if you are expecting  " made in japan quality "  your kidding yourself .   this is the reason you will see many brand name goods ,  also selling with no-name labels  ( i . e coby )  .   same production line ,  different labels .   it is also one of the reason folks are impressed with apple ipods .   apple demands excellent qc ,  and the destruction of goods that don't meet the standard .   in exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of qc .   like everything in life ,  ya gets whats ya pay for .g- since the beginning of windows  ( v1 . 0 ,  et al )  there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs ,  there will always be pain in the a** software .   one of the reasons xp has such a prominent 'roll-back' feature .   and also the reason many ,  if not most ,  power users run multiple machines .   of course ,  these days we have to fill billy g's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of xp .   most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines ,  each one with a different use .   it shouldn't be this way ,  but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software ,  for many purposes  ( mp3's ,  scanning ,  video ,  controlling radios ,  composing music ,  et al )  ,  one machine won't cut it because xp ain't as stable as folks think .   the more programs ,  and the more varied in type ,  the more instability is introduced into any windows installation .  why do you think businesses run win2000 or win2003 ,  because there are less software 'toys' that run under 2k ,  and the 'admin' can prevent you from loading a lot of software 'toys' .h- in the end ,  understand what you are buying before you buy so that you'll have better luck getting what you want ,  and you won't look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site ( s )  knows is dead wrong ,  or just plain stupid .i- when you truly understand the product ,  you'll be able to write truly useful reviews ,  and that what all readers want ,  useful information .to one and all ,  may your 'toys' keep you happy
this is my first gps and i wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking ,  hiking ,  kayaking ,  and in the car to .  i found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls .  also the 2 times i called garmin with questions i was able to talk to someone who is in the usa as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some .  on the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software
you must have received ca-709  ( without the cassette component )  by mistake .   ca-706 is prepackaged with the cassette component
it's a simple device ,  so there's not to say about it other than it does the job .  you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered  ( they glow a bright blue )  .
i bought this to illuminate the keyboard on my 12 "  apple powerbook when i work in the dark .   it works well ,  and shines impressively bright and wide .   i even use it to read by simply sitting it on its back on my lap as i read in bed and pointing the lamp at my book .   it's too bad the lamp's arm isn't telescopic or it'd make for a perfectly good clip-on booklight right out of the box .this device is well built ,  folds into a form that protects it from damage ,  even when thrown in a laptop case full of stuff that might crush something built less solidly .   and it has a nice retracting usb cable .   the retraction device for the cable ,  like most i've seen on devices like this ,  can be a bit finnicky but with the right pulling technique works correctly about 90% of the time .update ,  may ,  2005 .   the light died .   no idea why .   so ,  maybe it's not as good as i thought .    :

after ordering non-oem inks from several different places on the web  ( and having some problems with them )  ,  i discovered that amazon sold oem at great prices .i went to my local office supply store and purchased a complete set of 5 inks for my canon pixma ip4000 at a cost of $75 .   later that day i found them on amazon at almost 1/2 the price !also ,  when it comes to oem inks ,  i discovered that they seem to last almost 3 times as long as the generic and refilled versions .
this is the ultimate ears super fi model especially designed for  " bassheads ,  "  featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies .  i don't think ue would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature .  yes ,  the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed ,  but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction .on the bright side ,  however ,  the bass reproduction is  marvelous .  not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones i've ever used ,  the quality is excellent .  the bass is tight and pleasant ,  neither boomy nor thumpy .  this overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the ue 5 eb's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented  " front and center ,  "  including techno bass  ( aka  " car audio bass "  )  ,  drum n' bass ,  and many types of rap/hip-hop .  for music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall ,  opinions will vary .  with rock music ,  for example ,  the strong bass is certainly a plus ,  but i have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly ,  and some detail is lost .it should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the eb's a good choice for people who own ipods and feel that their music player is weak on bass .  without any eq adjustment ,  the ipod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is present .in terms of build ,  the eb's superficially seem well-constructed and designed .  i have heard complaints ,  however ,  that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage .  be careful out there !  thoughtfully ,  eb has includes a variety of ear tips with these iem's  ( including foam ,  flanged ,  and plain )  so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit .  the eb's don't extend deeply into the ear canal ,  which is a mixed blessing .  on the one hand ,  this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal ,  comfort is good and isolation decent .  however ,  if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating .  making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the eb's .oh ,  and some people think that the eb's look kind of strange when worn .  larger than the higher-priced super fi 5 pro model ,  the eb's stick out a bit .  your call as to whether this is a problem .like all of the ue iem's in this series ,  the eb's are packaged with a nice set of accessories ,  including a 1/4 "  adapter plug ,  a sound attenuator ,  a soft travel case ,  an earwax loop ,  and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with iem's ,  cord tangling .it's unlikely that the eb's will prove satisfactory as your  " everyday "  earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music .  the truth is ,  however ,  that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the super fi 5 pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users  ( i own both )  .  but as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music ,  the eb's are well-designed and definitely fun
it certainly did .   excellent color qualit
this extension cord did what it was supposed to do and did it just fine .   no problems whatsoever
i was looking for an inexpensive ,  yet high quality ,  long lasting ,  and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane .  a fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace .  the brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly .  offering two lines of crisp ,  highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs .  my experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape .  in fact ,  i found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet .  since i purchased the 1750 ,  i have found many uses for it around the home office and i wonder how i got by without one in the past !  my only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters ,  it does not offer a dash or hyphen ,  so when one is  required ,  i find myself using a star instead .  that is a minor complaint though .   the brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on aa battery power alone ,  so i have not felt the need to purchase the adapter
box worked perfectly as expected .  however ,  it would be nice to be able to upgrade firmware to the new hd like performance or via a trade-in program to allow old customers to upgrade to the new sling boxes
i was looking for something suitable to house my sansa ,  and this fit the bill better than most .  the leather case is superb ,  looking sharp ,  snug and protective .  i enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it .  both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back ,  if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it .  the cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth ,  great for cleaning .  the screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles ,  still haven't figured out how yet ,  and i may trim it to make it more visually appealing .  but ,  really ,  if you invest in a product such as this ,  it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen !  the larger case is compact and protective ,  having a small storage area ,  yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap ,  generic looking sansa logo .  only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt ,  but not as a removable type .  only if you put it on when putting on the belt ,  which can be impractical in some circumstances .  this way ,  i suppose ,  it wouldn't be able to fall off
it's great if you have high speed enabled devices .   it's very fast a 2gb is sufficient for almost purpose
i you own a smartphone ,  you'll need one of these .  also happy this came with an adapter card ,  to plug in the microsd into it to move data from my mac to the phone .
i have the canon mp500 printer and canon rebel xt camera - both capable of producing amazing results ,  but paper makes a huuuuge diference in photo printing .  i have both the canon photo plus glossy and the photo pro papers .  if you are looking to print out very impressive photos ,  then i would recommend getting the 8x10 photo plus glossy - definitely nice enough to frame .  and with plus glossy ,  you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store .  and i even scanned a professional photo that i had done last year with my mp500 and printed using plus glossy ,  and the print is significantly better than the original .pros :  best value canon has to offer .  great ,  great prints ,  my favorite paper overall .  as good as pro ,  and less expensive .   about 55 cents per page in a 30 page pack of pro compared to 40 cents per page in a 20 page pack of plus .cons :  none at all so far .   have not seen if photos last over time
camera works great !   the first one i ordered did not function correctly but amazon promptly replaced it .   resolution is good and audio is a great bonus that works very well .   a great feature for me that i found was not available on all other devices was the ability to have video stored on a network folder .   additionally ,  there is no software required to run this
i've used the keyboard/mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all i would wish .  of course ,  any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup ,  but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever i wish .the only drawback ,  and it is minor ,  is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when caps lock or num lock is on .  i have to look over at the wireless receiver for this .  additionally ,  it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit .  yes ,  it would draw down batteries more quickly ,  but as an option it would be user selected .all in all ,  a good wireless keyboard/mouse combination ,  and one i am quite glad i purchased .life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body .but rather to skid in broadside ,  thoroughly used up ,  totally worn out ,  and loudly proclaiming ," wow ,  lord !  what a ride !  "
i purchased the adorama slinger bag after first purchasing the tamrac velocity 5 .   the tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag .  unfotunately ,  it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle .   the slinger bag addressed both of these deficiencies .   when worn as a waist bag ,  it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag .   there are two water pouches on the slinger bag  ( which is a real requirement as i live in arizona )  .the adorama slinger bag is a great travel bag .  it is light weight and has great utility .   i highly recommend it .
i have no complaints about this flash drive .   it does what it should ,  is easy to use ,  has enough storage to backup all my digital pics from my hard drive  ( so far !  )  ,  and is not expensive .
i live in manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception .  i use it hooked up to an hp 3200 lcd tv with built-in tuner .  it took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception .  the cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light .  i have it resting atop my center channel speaker .  $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football
this phone is small ,  great battery life ,  awesome range ,  and no interference .   the features are subtstanial and the quality is amazing .   from one that has always had uniden cordless phones this is a substantial upgrade .
the over-the-air picture is crisp ,  colors are bright and the size is just right .  pretty good viewing angle as well
i was debating over the picturemate ,  kodak printer dock 3 ,  sony ddp-fp50 ,  and the hp photosmart 475 .  i made the choice of the hp and i love it !  the prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints .  i use the hp 4x6 boarderless premium plus photo paper with the hp ink and the prints are just wonderful .  forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all .   (  .  .  .  )  the hp produces bright ,  vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime .  the picturemate is also alot larger than the hp 475 .  the 1 . 5gb hard drive is a plus as well .  hp said that the remote is not included but they lied ,  they come with the remote and battery .  overall ,  this printer is the best i have own
i did a lot of research on amazon . com before i finally decided on this mouse .   i wanted to replace my  ( extremely )  small kensington usb mouse with a retractable cable .   at home ,  i use a wacom tablet .   next month i am traveling abroad ,  so i wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the kensington .   wireless was key for portability .   i also wanted something rechargeable ,  and i didn't want the usb adapter sticking out .i received it today ,  and i'm on my first charge .   so no comments on batteries  ( which can be replaced with other aaa nimh for optimal performance if desired anyway )  .- i have large but skinny hands .   mouse is small ,  but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers .   of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse ,  but if you want portability ,  this is about the right size .- i have a powerbook that runs tiger  ( 10 . 4 )  .   excellent bluetooth connection .   also very good response ,  very little delay .   only reservation is for the scroll wheel ,  which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands ,  because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position .   it is hard to explain ,  but not a big issue for me .- usb charger works well .   the added size of the usb adapter helps with comfortability  ( still flat ,  but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse )  - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse .- as mentioned by others ,  installing the batteries is a challenge .   pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top  ( part with the anycom label )  away from the clickers .   once i figured it out ,  not so hard .overall ,  i don't seek perfection anyway ,  so this mouse does the job adequately for me .   i haven't tried any other bluetooth mouse before ,  so i'm more or less in awe
excelent ,  hard drive ,  good price and good time for seller .thanks
once the speaker of choice for every hard rockin' audiophile with a big enough garage ,  klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that didn't know the real value of what they'd bought .   but after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles ,  klipsch is back on top ,  from a sound quality standpoint -- and it shows in the promedia 2 . 1 thx .i have my trio connected to a new mac pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical .   yes ,  there are more complex set-ups ,  with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room ,  but if you just want the magic without the madness ,  the klipsch promedia 2 . 1 thx is an incredible  ( and very affordable )  solution that's quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes .of course ,  there are other 3-speaker desktop systems by makers like logitech ,  cyber acoustics ,  and intec ,  but here's the difference :  klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer ,  while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers .   not the same thing .   the only brands that are true competitors to klipsch in this area are bose ,  harman kardon ,  jbl ,  and altec lansing .   i find that the altec lansing and jbl 3-speaker sets both sound nasal and  " tinny "  on the high end ,  while the bose and harman kardon sets sound great ,  but are more expensive .   so ,  after a good look  ( and listen )  around ,  i went with klipsch .in any case ,  this is an incredible sound set-up for your computer-based music player and should not be overlooked .   enjoy
we replaced a tape unit with this one and are so pleased .   no more waiting for the tape to rewind and this one keeps the messages once played until you remove them .   also very accurate on time .   we love it !
i'm not much of a techie .   but ,  i do have lots of documents and pictures that i can't bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day .i used to back up my most important files on cd :  an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple cds and lots of time .   but ,  with this 2gb flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize .   the files are copied over to the device quickly ,  and easily .the 2 gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive .scandisk even includes a  " synch "  software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data .    ( the software also helps you copy over your outlook messages ,  folders ,  appointments ,  tasks ,  and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive .  )also ,  i can imagine that the use of the synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine .physically ,  the unit is small ,  sleek with a case that feels substantial .   the retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use .this thing is great .   i only wish i'd started using it sooner .
this samll web cam is doing a great job connecting my families overseas .  the flexible shoe is really handy and the image and voice quality is beyond my expectation
i would highly recommend reading the businessweek review on this product that came out on september 12 ,  2005 .   businessweek as reviewed all the major gps navigation options on the market and ranks the cobra nav one 4500 as number one .   here is an excerpt from the businessweek article :" cobra's nav one 4500 and garmin's streetpilot 2720 ,  which each sell for $800 to $1 , 000 ,  use a more straightforward approach .  the traffic info travels along with fm radio broadcasts from clear channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets .  an fm antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system .  "" i preferred the cobra ,  mostly for its big ,  bright 5-inch screen and its built-in radio receiver .   ( the garmin receiver is $200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio .  )  when you encounter traffic ,  a pop-up on the screen and a voice give you three options :  keep driving ,  reroute me ,  or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one .
i used this card on my nokia n70 for storing mp3 files .  granted i can't fit my entire music collection on it ,  but if i wanted to ,  i'd buy an ipod .  this is perfect for listening to my favourite songs on the go ,  as well as taking pictures and video clips !  highly recommended
the headset works great ,  comfortable .  i just wish they had better sound quality .  .  . for instance when playing music
easy to use ,  nice  ( in appearance )  ,  very comfortable  ( lots of space )  and at an excellent price !  i highly reccomend it
having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far ,  i can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results .  the drivers at least for mac os x are easy to understand and reliable .  the ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing ,  is a vey nice touch as well .  however ,  it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me .  by using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings ,  one can get nice rich colors that are on cue .  thus this printer makes good for doing proofs .  as an artist and graphic designer ,  having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase .  compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up .  also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers .  the only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer .  also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey .  but what inkjet dosen't have that problem ?  anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often .  so any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it ,  the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job .  so i'm giving 5 stars on the epson 128
excellent mount for the 2 tv's i've purchased .   was suprised to buy one about a month ago from amazon . com for 149 . 95 then was able to buy this one for 124 . 95 .   did i pay too much for the first mount ?        ollie .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
what a relief to find this mouse after having bought a microsoft 6000 lazer mouse which caused my tendonitis to flare up again really bad .   i had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another microsoft  " ergonomic "  mouse a year ago ,  which became chronic ,  but barely noticeable until i tried the 6000 .i also tried a logitech v200 ,  which is a good mouse ,  just not nearly as comfortable as the 450 .   the buttons on both of these logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless .   this was not so on the ms 6000 .if you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook ,  the logitech v450 is it .   my hands are fairly large ,  and for the $15 more than the v200 ,  it is definitely worth it as i spend a lot of time on computers
this is a very simple product that works as advertised .  easy to set up within macos x .  i use the airtunes functionality which is very cool .  i don't use the usb printing .  while more expensive than other 802 . 11g routers/access points ,  the simplicity + airtunes functionality make it worth the extra money
note :   this is a review of the targus pa225u retractable phone & ethernet cord  ( plastic casing )  .   it's the rectangular model ,  not the oval shaped one .i'm on the road 50-75% of the time for work and have used this on almost every trip .   i initially bought it because i forgot my regular network cord while traveling and needed to buy something quickly .   i like to be able to move around in the hotel room and use this cord along with a cheap little plastic cable joiner to connect it to the hotel internet connection so i can sit on the couch or bed while connected to the internet .   i've experimented with a travel wireless router but keep coming back to the wired connection when the wireless connection has problems .   i've used it for over a year and have never had any problems with the retraction
this portable cd holder is perfect for me .   i work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym .   my cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd's .   i like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch .   i would recommend it to anyone
ok .  .  here's the deal .   i've been an avid magellan user for the past 3 years .   i love my magellan .   i've never liked the garmins because of their clumsy interface  ( the buttons placed above the display never made sense to me )  and how the menu structure was built .however .  .  .  .  we're planning a 2000 mile road trip from utah up to the oregon coast .   we needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time .   my wife bought me the magellan explorist 600 for fathers day .   i forced myself to use it for two days  ( and believe me ,  it was torture )  .   i could go on and on about why i sent it back .what i ordered as a replacement was the gpsmap 60cx .   now keep in mind that i felt like someone who had turned to the dark side .i couldn't be happier with my decision .while i agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps ,  and the expense of additional ones ,  this unit rocks !   it acquires satellites within seconds .   it has expandable memory .   it has a color screen .   it manages geocaches .   it auto-routes .   it stores 1000 waypoints .   it has sirf technology .   it is a usb interface .   it has a belt clip .   it changes display contrast at night  ( automatically )  .   it slices .  .  .   it dices .  .  .  .suddenly the dark side isn't so dark !  !this is a great unit that i would recommend to anyone .
bottom line up front :works very well ,  very low price ,  works much better with theincluded drivers than with the generic windows xp driverdetailed review :i bought this so i could use my new treo 700w with my non-bluetooth-enabled laptop .   the price was my main motivation in buying it .initially i just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay ,  however it didn't always work and i'd have to unplug/replug for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other .after getting tired of that ,  i decided to install the drivers that ship with the product .   i've had a much better experience since i did that .   i was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price ,  but it's actually quite good and gives you a ton of options that the standard xp driver does not provide .if you use a this with a laptop and you dock/undock it ,  you'll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to docking/undocking .   otherwise ,  you'll probably end up having to unplug/replug it
this is a great multi-function printer/scanner/copier/fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload .print quality is excellent ,  scanning quality is excellent ,  copying quality is excellent ,  faxing is faxing .the control software is fine ;  not great ,  but it does the job .   the networking features ,  including built-in wireless ,  makes this printer a snap to integrate into your office / business using a wireless network .some concerns :   after heavy usage the top document feeder ,  used for scanning ,  faxing ,  or photocopying a stack of loose documents ,  begins to jam .   the rollers need to be cleaned to avoid this ,  and getting jammed paper out of the top document feeder is very difficult .however ,  the fact that this piece of equipment even has a document feeder for this sort of functionality is pretty good .the fax log keeps a record of outgoing faxes and you can re-send them easily enough ,  but you can't re-print faxes received ;  the fax log merely logs their reception ,  but not the fax itself .overall it's a good multi-function at a reasonable price with a lot of functionality built into it .   would recommend to anyone who only has a light document load ,  with maybe the occasional large document scanning / copying requirement
i often have problems with memorex brand but have never had a problem with verbati
unit performs well ,  is reasonably fast ,  and has on-board security software that will allow the setting of a password .   if you choose this option ,  loading each time upon insertion is a little slower ,  and you must 'stop' the unit prior to removing it when operating under the password protection .   the few times i have forgotten i've not lost any data ,  but it scolds me for doing so upon the next use .
there are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones .   but here are my 2 cents :i got these to replace some aging sony mdr-v2's that i purchased maybe 10 years ago .   the ear cushions of the mdr-v2's had begun to deteriorate ,  and i figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years .   i just compared them to the older v2s and i can say that the v6 is definitely better .   they fully surround the ears  ( v2s just sat on your ear ,  pressing on them )  .   the v6s also seem to offer more detailed sound .   i concur that they sound a little bright ,  but i can take care of this on my ipod by setting the eq to reducetreble  ( but i like the brightness ,  so sometimes i don't do that )  .   i do not concur with other review comments about weak bass .   they appear to have the right amount .    ( imho - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade ,  at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound )  .   i also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good  ( plenty loud for me with the ipod - and i listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones )  .as a last comment ,  i notice amazon has these for about $65 .   i paid $99 at a local store .   buy from amazon  !    ( no - i don't work for or invest in them  ; -
overall ,  i like this surge protector and would buy it again .  i bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets ,  six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brick-style transformer plugs .  i did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration ,  and this unit always came up .   it has worked just fine for the month or so i've owned it .  i particularly appreciate the angled plug ,  which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem .i only have two quibbles with the apc--the color and the stiffness caused by the plug-activated safety shutters .   plugging and unplugging cords requires some force to overcome the safety shutters ,  which could be a problem if you are trying to get something plugged or unplugged while the unit is in an awkward position or hard-to-reach location .   on a much more minor note ,  the black unit and cord stand out quite a bit against light-colored walls and carpets ,  even when tucked behind a desk .i don't use the phone or coax plugs ,  so i don't know if my unit has the problem  ( or  " feature "  )  other reviewers have reported with internet signal degradation
i purchased the notebook cooler approximately one month ago ,  after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating .  thankfully ,  the same time i read that ,  circuit city was having a sale on this item for only $15 ,  after mail-in rebate .  fast forward one month and my opinion of the cooler so far :  not bad .  .  .my laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now ,  and the internal fan rarely comes on .  the notebook cooler itself is smartly designed ,  with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat .  i'll admit ,  the usb connector cable is a bit flimsy ,  and i can see why some folks have complained .  for those users who travel frequently  ( or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often )  ,  you may want to exercise extra caution .  the blue led light that some reviewer claims is too  " strong "  is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to ,  you could always tape over the light and problem solved .  as for the fan noise ,  i would say the low setting is comparable to  " white noise ,  "  which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it !  the high setting ,  on the other hand ,  is a bit loud ,  and i can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or tv to compensate .  usually ,  though ,  i only use the high setting when it's really hot in the room ,  or if i'm running intensive programs like photoshop or some video game .overall ,  i'd say i'm very satisfied with this product .   ( though ,  i am somewhat disappointed that antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check .  )
this was part of my stereo update .  i selected this receiver for quality ,  value and ease of operation .  i matched it up with the sony cdpcx355 300 cd player and a fresh pair of those bose 301-v speakers .  years ago i used to be an audiophile and i now think i'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby
there is a little story before this :i bought a pair of sony mdr-xd100's  ( they are full cup headphones )  because i lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player  ( sony hd5 )  .  i took them out of the package and found that ,  even at full volume on the player ,  it cannot drive the headphones sufficently .  i went to a few electronics stores then found the koss eq50 .on with the review :yes ,  there is a slight hiss ,  but i find it alright .  the biggest gripe i have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft  ( ie ,  on a bus or subway )  uses a cellphone ,  this devices picks it up .  you can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers .  i do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue .it also does a great job of amplifying the signal ,  it works very well ,  i can now listen to my xd100's properly  ( and they are very good !  )  .  i haven't used the eq much but what i can say is that it is very ,  very sensitive .  raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference .  at a half ,  my headphones start to distort .if your looking for a nice little eq and/or preamp this is the product for you .  it has its drawbacks though ,  mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course ,  the hiss but it isn't too loud & i can live with it .i reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer
i've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed .  this is not true if you're carefull .   first of all ,  my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned off when you change the batteries .   pretty simple ,  huh ?   also ,  don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it .  the main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner ,  and i just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10% .   i primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and i love it
we bought 3 of these and every one has dead pixels .  it's not a ton ,  but one monitor has three that are red in the center of the screen ,  and other has a few that are bright green in the corner .  not a huge deal ,  but there are some in all 3
i've used this card for a while now and i'd say that i like it overall .  the power usage is great .  the drivers have been vastly improved and now you are able to scan for networks .  those of you who are interested in wardriving should look elsewhere .  if you want to use netstumbler or pocketwarrior in windows or kismet and airsnort in linux ,  either go for the linksys wcf12  ( prism based )  or lucent orinoco based pcmcia card .  if you're looking to run just 802 . 11b and check email ,  stream music ,  browse the web ,  etc ,  this card will be perfect plus it'll save you some battery power
i purchased my first roadmate in august 2004 .   since then i have taken it to various places in north america .   it's gotten me out of some tight spaces .   i've never gotten lost while using it .i purchased the second one when the voice interface on the first failed .   i sent it in for repair .    ( the extended warranty had just run out about 2 weeks earlier )  the new roadmate arrived in two days and has worked fine ever since .   the old roadmate was returned to me repaired in about a week .i gave the first one to my wife and she has used it with success ever since .pros :   easy to use .  amazing detail .cons :   sometimes takes a long time to acquire satellitesoriginal mount is useless after about a month .   i got aftermarkettripod for each unit and they seem to work fine .  software updatesare expensive .
people buy expensive av cables because of most people would think that more expensive cables will work better and last longer .   i've found that it's more a matter of quality control .   i'll roll the dice with cheap  ( price )  cables untill they fail on me
i am happy to have several sandisk products ,  and all of them are excellent .
this was needed for my panasonic dvd recorder .   works well - hope it holds up as advertised .  .  .  .  looks like high quality and works well .  so far - everything is as expected - and that is good
first off ,  these puppies sound good !  however ,  there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know :the sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley ,  as with most in-ear headphones .  the low end is there ,  but for full effect ,  it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume .  since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves ,  this sweet spot is not very wide .  that said ,  however ,  i recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small .  most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures  ( or both )  to deliver .  since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers ,  maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber !  i am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for .  such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package .  maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard  ( for the price they better be )  .   so if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback ,  look into buying those pricey phones .   the lack of such bass is the only reasoni didn't give it five stars .also ,  the lack of colored left  ( blue or white )  & right  ( red )  tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time .  i didn't realize i had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable i just had to check .   so be careful .riding while using them can be dangerous ,  since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead .bang for the buck ,   (  i paid $69 . 99 on amazon )  ,  i really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados .
i have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure .  imo ,  you cannot beat the sound of a set of &quot ; over-the-head&quot ;  headphones .  i have tried all styles :  earbuds ,  behind the neck ,  clips ,  even the ear plugs .  nothing gives the sound and comfort of the ktx pros  ( granted ,  i have never tried the sportapros or portapros ,  but from what i have read ,  they are the same headphone .  except they are ugly !  )  .  the ktx pros have both great lows and great highs .  plus ,  you can't beat that price
this is a great swicth with low price .   i use it together with d-link di-704 4-port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 pc ,  two servers ,  one powermac and a laptop connected to cable modem isp .  connecting via the swicth for internet sharing doesn't show any noticeable slow-response as compared to connecting via the router directly .   it works well by itself as we as with d-link di-704
the case itself fits very snug around the ipod ,  and even gives it a better look .   the only complaint that i have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open ,  and even falls off at times .   i still give the case a 4 star rating ,  because i am a soldier in iraq ,  and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my ipod clean .   if a product can keep something clean in iraq ,  then i am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere .
this screen is great .upgraded from a 23 "  and the increase in realestate is awesome .you can play games with crystal clarity ;  have so many pages up and read them clearly .you will need a graphics card that supports dual-link dvi ,  not a card that says dual dvi .i installed the geforce 7800 gt on my pc and it works flawlessly !the quadro cards are great ,  but big $$$ .the 7800gt can be had for under $300 !here's a list of cards for pc and apple :nvidia geforce 6800ultra ddl agp for powermac g5nvidia geforce 6800gt ddl agp for powermac g5nvidia geforce 6600 pci express for powermac g5 ( pci express )nvidia geforce 7800gt pci express for powermac g5 ( pci express )nvidia quadrofx 4500 pci express for powermac g5 ( pci express )for the pc windows platform ,  the following graphic cards support the apple 30 "  cinema display :nvidia quadrofx 2000nvidia quadrofx 3000nvidia quadrofx 3400nvidia quadrofx 3450nvidia quadrofx 4000nvidia quadrofx 4400nvidia quadrofx 4500nvidia geforce 7800gtnvidia geforce 7800gtxnvidia geforce 7800gtx 512
never been game player much since pong-purhcased bf2 last december for the pc and loved it .  flying was limited though-util i purchased my g7 from ne and have been enjoying mucho fast speeds ,  easily adjusted ,  and for internet parusing it has a built in back button .  have to change out battery every two days but gives plenty of warning and is always charged when i need to replace .  absolutely the best mouse i have ever owned .
i'm not entirely sure how other people are finding ways to damage their earphones ,  but i have used the same pair since the summer of 2000  ( purchased from amazon )  ,  and i have never had any difficulties besides losing the essential earpiece covers ,  which were easily replaced .  when they are wound up in their little yellow case ,  the headphones' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that don't offer such security .compared to other headphones i have used ,  especially noise cancelling of both active and passive varieties ,  these phones have superior bass response ,  and all levels of sound seem reasonably clear .i have used these earphones with many different devices over five years :  cd players ,  mp3 players  ( including ipods )  ,  pocket pcs ,  desktops ,  and notebooks .  they always sound great ,  except - due to their greater sensitivity to sound ,  i often am able to detect the hiss caused by poorly designed audio hardware ,  which i otherwise wouldn't hear with over-ear phones .  pocket pcs especially seem prone to this ,  as their audio hardware is crammed so tightly in with noisy backlit screens and processors
this is my first mp3 player so i researched it carefully before making my decision .  the gorgeous screen ,  the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points .  i'm so glad i bought it .  videos look great on the screen .  some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general i love it .  the built in speaker doesn't do it justice .  even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing .  making playlists with the creative software is very easy .  my biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it .  no case ,  no screen protectors out for it .  i'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do .  but for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the ipod or the zune .
when we needed speaker systems for a batch of new workstations ,  price was the main consideration .  the price for these units was well below budget .   since our main application for them was for audio-enhanced cat  ( computer assisted training )  ,  high fidelity and volume were not issues .   they worked admirably for the purpose .the use of a usb port for the power supply was a clever twist .  one of my aggravating support woes is keeping speaker power adapters matched up with corresponding speakers .   i had been buying unpowered  ( unamplified )  units with no manual volume control .   the usb trick gives me just what i want
it's hard to believe the quality of the sound from this very small device .   mp3's sound great as do the voice recordings .   with 1 gig of space you can record an entire day of seminar speakers and still have space left .   the built in stereo or mono mics are great .  .  . plus ,  you can use it to carry files to and from work .the function buttons are logical and easily accessed ,  even with my big fingers .   priced right ,  i'm glad i purchased .   received it on time .   totally happy with my purchase .my only wish is that it came with a case and a neck or wrist strap .   it's so small it gets tossed into whatever pocket is available and that can lead to scratches from keys ,  etc
.  .  . for a surge protector .   but as far as i can tell ,  it's doing its job .   plus it looks kind of neat
i am a success coach and i record all my coaching calls as a standard practice .  this recorder has performed fantastically in all situations .  i get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation  ( depending on battery quality )  and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls  ( i have an adapter for the phone )  .  i have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results .  i highly recommend using rechargeable batteries  ( always have one extra on hand )  when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time .  recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing .  the unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare .  the unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire ,  so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings .  each stop and restart begins a new file .  for me that works great !  if you are looking for one continuous file ,  do not shut it off .  you can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use .  you would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money
i read the other reviews for these speakers so i had very high expectations .  i can only say wow !  the premium price  ( compared with lesser 2 . 1 speaker systems )  is absolutely justified
a sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop .   i took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the kensington contour .   i didn't want to buy a kensington .   i wanted a backpack making company with a name i knew ,  like jansport , or kelty .   i've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products .   i settled on the kensington because it had the qualities i was seeking :  comfort ,  quality materials and design ,  water proofing ,  laptop padding ,  urban black ,  rugged exterior ,  sophisticated appearance ,  lots of pockets ,  adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket .   i write and work in media for a living .   mostly i work at home ,  but once a week i travel to cities .   this pack does exactly what i want it to do - have places for everything i need ,  protect my precious laptop ,  and look hip .so now it is a few months later .   i still like my pack ,  but twice now the hardware has broken .   the first time it was just the zipper-handle on the little outside pocket .  it fell off .   kennisington immediately replaced the pack for free .   last week at the airport the tab that holds and adjusts the left shoulder strap-- broke when slung the pack across my back .  i haven't contacted them yet
i'm using the product as i respond to this request for a review .   sufficiently compact for ease of packing in my laptop case .   no technical issues  ( so far )  .   tracking is excellent .   has worked flawlessly under daily working conditions .   recommend highly
this review pertains specifically to the targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2 . 0 hub .the cord is about 2 . 5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc ,  which sits on the ground ,  to the top of the desk .  it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs - one just to transmit data ,  the second to power the unit .  the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware ,  and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways ?  if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing ,  then it does have an input for a separate power source ,  which you will have to buy separately .in short ,  if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use ,  this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
could not have been easier to install - literally just put the included cd in the drive ,  and plug the device into your usb 2 . 0 port .   installed and self-configured in minutes .   very small ,  light ,  no additional power cords to worry about ,  no additional software  ( beyond the automatically installed drivers )  to install - quick and easy .   only issue i found is that the antenna is permanent ,  so you could never swap for replacement/better antenna like you can on some other wireless nics
i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations .  it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes .  after 3 conversations with canon customer care ,  we decided it was not the printer ,  but the cheaper ink .  i switched back to canon ,  bit the bullet on the price ,  and everything is fine .  i found decent prices on amazon ,  particularly at eek industries
nice sound ,  i will admitt for the price ,  i get big sound ,  with quality .   only thing is a humming ,  hissing sound when machine is idle .  ohtherwise ,  worth it .
i didn't buy this on amazon but wanted to say this device is great .  the only bad thing was my laptop is old !   can't go wrong with this one
i opened it ,  i put it in my psp and that was it .  i had plenty of space on the memory stick and i personally didn't have to do any special formatting i just popped it in and that was it .i did want to add ,  buy this online because in my comparison shopping it was much more expensive in brick and morter stores i visited
i have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters ,  they are burning at 8x in my nec 2500a burner .  that is pretty considering that it is advertised at 4x .  hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years
this backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my macbook safe .  its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything i need .  as a chronically disorganized person ,  the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings .  the strap is nicely padded and it's elastic ,  so shocks are well absorbed .a nice touch is a zippered 'cavity' at the top ,  which is an ideal place to store a laptop charger .the build quality seems excellent so far - it looks to be a very durable product .  i've always had good luck with wenger products in the past .the best part about this backpack is that it doesn't scream 'there's a computer in here ! ' .
these mini cd-rs work great in our sony mavica cd cameras at a cost of only  . 42 cents apiece
i have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set  ( a midiland 5 . 1 system )  was thoroughly aged and falling apart i decided it was time to upgrade .   i wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's .   i shopped around and came to the conclusion i would aim for the form factor speakers .   when considering this bose system ,  this must be taken into account .first off ,  this system is expensive .   for just under 1000 dollars  ( doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g ?  )  you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers ,  the subwoofer unit ,  and speaker cable .   at this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver ,  but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget .   bose includes 3 colors  ( white ,  silver ,  black )  and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit  ( a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not )  .what brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness .   for their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver .   anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through ,  without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store .once i got the system home it was very easy to set up and install .   bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system .   the only serious issue i have with this system ended up being with my receiver  ( an onkyo )  and not related at all with the speakers .since i do run this through my computer  ( presently a laptop )  i had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver ,  but when that was all said and done ,  i was extremely please with the system .   with a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges .my test soundtracks included :   gladiator ,  matrix  ( ii or iii )  ,  snatch ,  and music tracks ranging from techno ,  rock ,  classical ,  and alternative .   everything sounded great with enough low ,  high ,  and midrange response .   the second complaint i have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites .   i found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices .   that was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there .all in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs  ( though draining my bank account )  and providing me with great surround sound .good :   great range and volume of sound .   easy set-up .   well built speakers-aesthetically and physically .   no interference or feedback .bad :   subwoofer awkward ,  no dedicated center channel ,  pricey ,  no included receiver .for their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5 . 1 system .   here is one satisfied customer
i am overall quite pleased with these headphones .   the sound quality is excellent .   i've not had any problems with interference ,  background hiss or anything of that nature .battery life has been excellent .   i have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they'll last ,  but i use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they haven't failed me yet .the only reason i would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use .   i'm not really a big fan of this  " sport "  style of headphone ,  and probably wouldn't have tried these if i hadn't gotten them on clearance .   but ,  i found that after experimenting a little i was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable ,  even wearing them the better part of a workday
since there are very few cases that fit ipaq pdas ,  i recommend you get this one .   depending on type of your ipaq  ( 1900 series vs 3000 series )  ,  you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your pda into the case .   once you're done ,  however ,  it's very easy to use and carry .   it comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use .   the case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket ,  unlike so many other cases .   the obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface ,  this case won't provide much in a way of side protection  ( klutzes be warned )  .   the leather feels surprisingly good ,  almost a lambskin kind of quality .   the credit card space is not very useful ,  but you can shove a couple of business cards in there .  a solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available
i bought these here and have had the for a little bit now .  they work great .  i will buy more when needed .
the cable was a good price ,  and it fit my printer perfect .  worth the few pennies i paid
i have been using these for a while now and they seem pretty good to me .    ( disclaimer :  i am not an audio professional ,  nor do i have any expensive headphones to compare with .  )they have great detail in both low and high end .  in fact ,  i can hear things in some of my music that i never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam on-ear style or earbud styles .   this is good when listening to original cds ,  or hq mp3/aac ,  but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that i had just not heard before .  .  .i tested these with a frequency response program on my mac ,  show as having 25-15 , 600 hz  ( in my ears ,  your ears may vary .  .  .  )   .   this range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds .they do a good job of blocking out external noises-- great if you are in a bit of a noisy space .and ,  yes ,  they were a bit tight on the head initially .   to fix that ,  i got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches  ( pun intended )  .  this has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now ok to wear for long periods .   note :  this procedure is at your own risk ,  as i do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg .    ; - )    do not overstretch them ,  as the headband material ,  while flexible ,  undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take .great bargain headphones
sent check for full price fairly promptly ,  but not including tax ,  which ads say they will d
i got this toy for christmas .  ilove it .  i abanded this toy , and it got some brudle hits .  it was still alive !  know i keep safe becuse i don't want it to die .  i don't think this toy is a wast of money . mine is ginger .  it came with a silver/grey newborn kittin
this unit has a/v in .   my thought was that one could play video games on it ,  or view images from a camcorder/digital camera .   however ,  all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen .   so it does not allow me to do all i wanted .   it is also a bit on the loud side .   if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit .   i got one of those also ,  and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor .  it also does not make much noise
great for frequent air travel to pass the time .  minor complaints - instructions are sparse  ( had to get my son to show me how to use itunes & load songs )  ,  but still haven't figured out how to arrange songs on the ipod .  my problem
actually 4 and a half stars .  .  . i borrowed one of these logic3 amplified ipod speaker systems for a weekend camping trip and was impressed with the sound and portability .  i decided to buy one of my own after looked at several other makes and models all of which were more money .  plenty of connectivity along with base adapters to hold most ipod models securely .  the little subwoofer and 'ambiance' switch make decent sound even at non-annoyingly low volume levels .  close to being a steal at the $59 . 00 i paid for i
high quality disks .   never a bad burn .   fast delivery .   buy this from this selle
this simple device is reliable for fixing positions .  and if you know about coordinates ,  you can set it in ,  and bingo .  you can compensate what it lacks of by using coordinates from a map while you paid unexpensive
have been using them for a week now .incredible sound for the size .   bass is incredible .  .  .  .  mids are accurate ,  highs are accurate .   these are the way to go if you're using an mp3  player .   i use them with the creative zen vision m 30  (  " the ipod killer "  )while walking ,  riding a bus or train in in n . y . c .  seals out external noise amazingly very well !  !  !pros :awesome accurate sound / incredibly light / don't protrude out of your ears / comes with  " 2 sets "  of three different sizes of silicone  plugs / plugs are ultra soft ,  comfortable and fit perfectly / secure well built storage case / cleaning tool / barely uses battery power !  / not the yup-tard white color .  .  .  .  much cooler black !cons :   none so far .i bought them directly from amazon for $75 . 99 with  " free "  4 day ultra fast shipping
great batteries for cameras .  they charge quickly ,  and it's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time  " just in case "
i received the correct q5949x cartridge .my calculations for cost per page is only 2 cents per page ,  which is contrary to another reviewer's claim of 12 cents per page .$120 . 00 divided by 6000 pages equals 2 cents per page .
researched a lot before i bought this tv and for the money ,  this one was hands down the best 32 "  lcd .    also ,  amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues .i mainly use this tv for my xbox 360 .   you will not be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same .    the game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well .   i provides sort of an anti aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges .  all in all ,  after owning the tv for about 2 months now ,  i couldn't be happier .    to get around the poor speakers ,  i just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound great .i've also hooked up an hd antenna and regular cable .   hd channels have a very good picture over the air .   some football games almost look better on this than on my 42 "  samsung dlp downstairs with the hd cable .   there's also a nice antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the over the air antenna .the only drawbacks to the tv are the 1 component input and the fact you can't use the pip with the cable connected ,  only the antenna .
this is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop .  it's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case .  it protects my laptop from surges through the ac outlet and phone jacks .  i have been pleased with apc  products for about six years .  they provide excellent customer support .  i  highly recommend their products
i love the new nanos .  i don't think i have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio .  it is small and very thin .  you barely feel it in your pocket ,  which might annoy some people but not me .  i'd rather get this than any zen products or sandisk sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner .  the screen is really bright with the full color display .  the new earbuds are a lot more comfortable than the old ones .  the new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out .  i don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me !  the new color coating is scratch resistant ,  but not the click wheel and the apple symbol .  but you don't notice the scratches on the white parts .  the longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano ,  24 hours !  the new 4 gb color nanos are the same price as the 2 gb of the 2nd gen nanos .  i'm so happy i waited after the 1st gen nanos came out .  i would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily ,  have a dark screen ,  and have a short battery life .  the new nanos are great deals and great gifts .  i recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good ,  reliable ,  scratch resistant ,  cool looking music player !  5/5 star
i previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse ,  i can'trecall the brand ,  but it was awful  ( battery contacts wouldn't stay in contactand it was hard to use )  .   i was using my laptop at my brother's house and helent me his logitech v200 .   it was awesome !  just plug in and use !i went home that nite and looked it up here and saw that others had hadsimilar experiences ,  so i bought one .   i've had it for about a month nowand love it .   the scroll wheel being able to lean left & right for sidewaysscrolling is a nifty feature .i recommend this product highly
i agree that these cables are way too expensive !  !  however that being said ,  they really do perform well .   i have been using them for almost a year and they are just solid .   colors always look their best .   i know it was a silly purchase but my dvd's look great .
this little unit is easy to use and ready to go !  !  !  !  not one problem with it so far ,  i've been using it for over two months now
these earphones are the best i ever had .  i never had to try other pairs of earphone because i absolutely loved these that i keep buying it !  after 6 years i buy the same one everytime .  of course i never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that i brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money .  it seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and i can answer why thats happening .  it's actually static electricity .  i experienced it myself a couple of times because i was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form .  it's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones i suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked .  the bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones .  hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model .  i abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year i think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost ,  broken or stolen .
i wouldn't be without this .  when i first bought the 20d it was my first digital slr and i spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap .  in the end i settled for using both and wouldn't have it any other way .  with the battery grip and hand strap in place i find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold .  that's all there is to it ,  that's what it does and it does it well .on the down side ,  and it's a small and transient down side ,  actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure .  i think the trick ,  security wise ,  is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first ,  then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap  ( if used )  .  i also don't like the attachment to the neck strap ,  i don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use .i use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached .  you can only use this if you also use the battery grip ,  or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location .  but since i always use the battery grip i don't have an issue .if canon read this ,  you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price ,  you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here
after buying my ipod ,  i felt my stereo system wasnt geting anyuse .  so i felt that instead of buying the bose soundock ,  which is about $300 ,  your better off only spending about $25 and getting just as good quality
my daughter uses a cochlear implant that has the option of being powered by 3 aa batteries .  we have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest .  we have tried energizer ,  duracell ,  etc .  she needs to replace them every day and a half .  since the implant is a high power draining device ,  every extra hour counts .  these batteries are one of the best values out there .
i've been using sbl soundcards for about 3 years .  i use it for recording live and with sound fonts .   this usb device is easy to set up and the sound quality is great !   one installation tip .   initially after i connected it and installed the software ,  i was not getting any sound ,  although the software was installed successfully .   i rebooted ,  and everything was detected and has worked fine since .   so just remember to reboot after installation .
like most other reviews ,  i will agree and say it make take a try or two to get the right feel and the right fittings .   what helped me is when i looped the wire around my ear and put the earphone in .   now it is crystal clear sound and a perfect fit .   movies are amazing !   my music collection never sounded so good .   if you want to get away from it all for awhile ,  slip these babies in your ears and chill
this is a fantastic home projector .   i am a very picky electronics fan .   this exceeded my expectations .   the colors are rich ,  bright & great .panasonic produces best colors .   i own their camera ,  camcorder & now this .   i am going to buy their hdmi dvd playe
this headset is everything that i hoped it would be and the seller rates 100
great all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school .   it has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it .   one of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes
for a long time i was looking for a phone to use with skype .   for the price and convenience ,  actiontec internet phone wizard was the best i found and ordered it from amazon  ( $42 . 99 with free shipping )  .   after receiving the modem i have been using it for almost a month now and i am extremely happy .   i have connected my codeless phone to it and everything seems to be working fine
i'm overly critical of sound quality .  at home i have the tritton surround sound headset running off optical connection .  this doesnt' compare to that but the tritton is $99 too .for the $ this is really nice .  sound ,  microphone and wire quality are all good .  controls are easy to use and the software is easy to use too .  they're also fairly comfortable .  good headset for work
the product is fine however when i ordered i added a gift card to the payment .  the gift card was not used and the purchase was paid in full with my credit card .  is my gift card still valid
very good ,  worth the money .  if you want a louder one ,  go for z 535
i love it but its been a battle trying to get used to the sensetivity and pressure of holding the pen .  i'm glad i bought it but it is something i cannot use all the time
my experience ,  with several repetitions :  the adapter ,  continuously plugged in ,  continuously on ,  works for about 10 days ,  then stops working and drops the connection .  it won't restart .  the only way to recover is to unplug it ,  plug in your spare  ( you do have a spare ,  of course )  ,  and let the netgear wg111t cool off for a couple of days .  then you plug it in again ,  and it works for about 10 days .  .  .
i bought one version from best buy ,  then i bought another with different buttons ,  then i bought this platinum one because its so cool looking ,  just make sure you save the code
i was looking for a basic cordless phone with out an answering machine and this one is great .  it has good reception and i like the size of it .  this phone is just what i was looking for .
works great ,  just like ti should ,  can add more sheets to store more .
i've had these headphones for just over two years ,  and i'm happy to see that they're one of the few pairs marketed as  " surround sound "  that have done quite well .  the reason behind that is because they're truly excellent headphones .  the range is spectacular and the inputs even more so .  you're given the option of rca and toslink  ( optical )  ,  which is all you really need .movies really do sound like movies .  .  . you hear things behind ,  in front ,  and to your left and right when you're connected via optical .  take note that dts also sounds 'boomier' and a tad crisper than dolby d does ,  especially in gladiator .honestly ,  i've nothing to complain about .  as a college guy ,  i couldn't bring my 1010 watt system from home .  which ,  i might add ,  never sounded as good as my headphones ,  mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically .  listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my macbook pro truly does some incredible things .  you'd be amazed at coldplay's  " the scientist "  if you heard it on these headphones .  it's indescribable .and by the way ,  i'm a slight audiophile .you seriously can't go wrong with these headphones .  and $65 for each additional pair of headphones ,  allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station ?  even better .  .  . good idea for families in apartments .incredibly advanced technology ,  incredible sound ,  and incredible results .  can't go wrong here .oh ,  and they're extremely comfy
excellent antenna .   why pay so much more for other indoor antennas such as terk or samsung .  i tried both of those but ended up with the zenith at a fraction of the price and with much better reception
used for backing up a huge quantity of high resolution digital images .  the drive is fast and quiet in it's operation ,  while taking up very little space on the desktop .  i highly recommend this drive and this brand of drives
my sound improvement wasn't as dramatic as many people describe ,  likely because i already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers ,  but i did notice an improvement over the integrated system i have once i made some adjustments .  if you listen to rock ,  pop ,  blues or jazz ,  this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier .  it also seems to improve pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's ,  though i have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the pandora player to prevent distortion .  if you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo ,  i'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound ,  but it might
i've tried several different brands of headsets and this one wins .  it reduces noise ,  has excellent sound and is comfortable for hours at a time .  my office is between the shop ,  where we make rocket engines ,  and the flight line on the airport ,  where airplanes are tested .  sometimes jet aircraft sit outside my window and perform engine run-ups ,  or idle the apu for hours .  this headset reduces the white noise while still allowing me to hear the phone ring even when a local f-4 phantom ii tests the afterburner .
this is my first time ever buying a really expensive mp3 player .   i bought it three weeks ago .   if i hadn't seen the creative zen vision : m ,  i probably would have bought the sandisk sansa e260 .   i love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv .   there is one problem i've had with it .   i'm not sure if anyone else has had this ,  but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when i'm listening to music .   i don't think it's the mp3s ,  because i've never ran into the problem with my other mp3 players .   if only they would've added the video cable for the tv and kept the charger ,  then i would've rated it a 5
just enough space to save video ,  photo ,  music etc .  .  .  all your files in one place and also is compatible with mac .  .  .  i love it .
good price .  good company .  i use this on my kodak cx7300 and it's fine .  good product to buy
for the most part ,  i do find hp ink to be the best .   however ,  every now and then a new ink cartridge is bad .  one of the colors doesn't print for some reason .   my opinion is that these ink cartridges are just too expensive to be getting any bad ones
this is an awesome little mp3 player .   i enjoy both the mp3 player and the fm radio .   it is very easy to use and syncs well with windows media player .   it is perfect for going to the gym because it is so small .   it came with a great leather case that fits it well and prevents damage and scratches .   my only problem with the player is that i can't fit more than 66-69 songs although it says there is about 70mb of space left on the player
i also ordered the antec sx-1030  ( which has yet to be shipped !  arrgghh !  !  )  .  according to antec ,  the 1030 includes 2 fans ,  but has space for 2 more ,  which is where this one comes in !  for those of you wondering what size &quot ; small&quot ;  is ,  it's an 80mm fan .  good airflow  ( don't know actual cfm )  and pretty quiet
after i read some folk's horror stories ,  i was really reluctant to purchase this device .  well ,  it took me only 5 minutes to configure the dwl-g710 ,  and another 10 minutes to find the best place for it in the house .  it was really simple and it worked well with our comcast/netgear wireless cable modem .excellent product
this receiver is a replacement for an older ,  more expensive ,  defective sony that i had .   it was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units .   i am satisfied with the product
this mouse works perfectly fast and easy without problems even if you don't install the software .if you need a cordless mouse this is what you have to bu
the product arrive to me in very good condition ,  will recommend this product to anyone who needs blank cd
no complaints - i'm pleased with the quality and price
i don't normally write reviews on products but in this case i feel i must share the value and features of this product .   you can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your dvd needs .   the quick start guide is just that  " quick "  and well planned .   the people at samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best i have seen well documented with pictures  ( in full color )  and just that step-by-step for the novice .   the setup diagram is excellent .   the features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize  ( any disc )  and away you go .   one touch record starts immediately .   the quality is superb especially in high definition .  i couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last electronics trade show so i was able to get it from back east about three weeks ago .  finalizing discs is a snap and easy i have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers !  it will play mp3s ,  cds ,  computer made divx movies ,  region 1 dvds ,  picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly .   you can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide .   if you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won't be disappointed
got my order quickly and found out that these cases are much better than the ones sold here locally ,  and they were cheaper  !  !
i have some decent mics in my cabinet ,  as well as a nice preamp ,  a/d converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup .   i wasn't expecting as good or better quality than i can already get ,  but i hoped the samson c01b usb studio condenser would at least give me a decent sound .   the idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits .   i was not disappointed .   installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a usb port on my laptop running xp and the other end into the mic .   it is far from the best mic i have ,  but it is certainly not the worst .   i have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin ,  but i found that not to be the case .   the noise floor when recording with the samson is a little high ,  and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my millenia preamp .    i have to record at slightly lower levels than i am used to ,  but for $79 ,  i am not complaining .   there is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in fasoft n-track studio .   the ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating .   way to go ,  samson
this car kit works very well .  the screen is a bit larger than other dvd players of similar type .  the only down side is that the battery only charges for about 2 hours  ( shorter than many movies )  .  so ,  if you are going to use this in the car ,  you need to be able to charge it
i was mislead with amazon review which said it supports conversion to mp3 format with the software supplied ,  it does not .  the help quite clearly states  " you cannot convert a file into an mp3 file "  .  it will convert to  . wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to mp3 .if it had mp3 support  ( at least conversion on the pc from the sony proprietary format which is  . msv )  i would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible .  it you record in full quality mode  ( 1 . 25 hours with built in 32meg memory )  and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing .  the voice up  ( so you hear each person in a conversation )  works very well as do other nice features .but it is let down with the software supplied not performing mp3 conversion .  going to  . wav then  . mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to  . wav to get away from proprietary  . msv takes up too much space .but i would buy one again ,  as it is very easy to use ,  small ,  and very high quality .  i just hope sony would listen to consumers and support mp3
i purchased a sony wega 27 inch tv .  i took advantage of it's rear component input labeled video4 .   i connected my sony dvp360 dvd player .   with dvd viewing ,  the movie dinosaur ,  bug's life ,  toy story 1 and 2 ,  and vegas vacation ,  the colors were very vibrant ,  details were dynamic ,  and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution .  i have viewed these same movies on larger screen hdtv's such as the pioneer elite and was disappointed ?  ?  ?  glass picture tubes provide a more realistic picture .  i can't imagine that i can do any better for my television than these cables .   i am completely happy with dvd movie watching on my sony wega with these monster component 3 cables
i agree with most of the reviews here .   the pc155 is a great headset overall .   the sound quality is great .   volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent .   i've listened to a great deal of mp3 music through these babies and i am very impressed .   spacial/stereo imaging is great and i've actually heard things in the songs that i have never heard before !   it actually shows the imperfections of my mp3 and makes me realize that i probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my cds .   the controls are also simple to use ,  both on the cord and on the pc .audio recording quality is great as well .   i have tried it with dragon and recognition works great with it .   playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side ,  however .   ps and bs are a little too hot even though i have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock .my biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department .   i first feel obligated to tell you that i do not normally wear full coverage headphones .   usually ,  i wear high-quality buds .   so ,  perhaps i just have to get used to it .   however ,  i feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones .   instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure ,  they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot .  .  .  even after only 15 minutes .so ,  despite my positive review of the sound quality ,  i am going to send these back and try the pc165 .   they supposedly have bigger ear cups ,  which will hopefully translate to more comfort ?   other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me .update :  i received the pc165 set and there is a big difference .   the sound is fuller and bigger  ( not louder )  on the 165s .   also ,  the comfort is much better .   they don't pinch my ears like the 155s .   the cord going to the headset is also thicker ,  which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage .   if you're thinking of the 155s ,  i would get the 165s instead
this is definitely a comfortable mouse if you don't have big hands .  it is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely ,  even if you are left-handed .  the extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward ,  backward ,  and switch between programs .  the button in the middle though  ( the one that lets you switch programs )  is out of the way .  it takes just a bit more effort to use ,  meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button .  i actually hardly ever use that button .  i can't live without the forward/backward buttons though .  i find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat ,  little buttons .  the mouse has a really good response to movement as well .  i've used it for gaming as well ,  though i admit i'm not a hardcore gamer .  i really recommend this mouse .  i can't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one
esactly what i was wanting .   when you turn there is resistance  ( springs i think )  and everything works great .   if you use flight sims you need this product .   works awsome
the memorex dvd+r 16x discs are great .   i have a lacie external 16x burner that i use with my mac and i have not yet burned a bad disc .   i would reccommend this product to anyone looking for lots of media for a good price
great quality .   i had a problem initially with xp media center compatibilty ,  but it works now after downloading an update from logitech's website .   recently ,  the sound is cutting out when communicating with my girlfriend across the country .   i think it might just be her interet connection though  ( we both have the same web cam )  .   as long as we restart the video call ,  then the sound comes back .   i am using windows live messenger as the video call program .   i have never used the cartoons that it comes with .   the video quality is very good when recording a video for email
i bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint .   i use it in chicago .   a lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal ,  not true at all .   i think the longest i have ever waited was 20 seconds .   it does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes ,  when i am surrounded by tall buildings  ( wacker dr .  )   but this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna .overall ,  this gps works perfectly .   the auto-reroute is fantastic ,  it is very quick to recalculate my route if i miss a turn ,  and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn .  you will not be disappointed with this purchase
only thing i did not care for was the design on the top of the disk .  other than that ,  these are quality dvd
i am glad i bought this backpack .  it exceeded all my expectations .  i strongly recommend this one
i just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup .   i had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck .   however ,  with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear .   it is so small and just excellent .   great work ,  logitech
i bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to italy and i am very happy with it .  i never had to change my batteries once and i listened to it all the time .  reading other people's reviews i threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great .  the only complaint i have is the suction cups aren't that great .  several times my ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun .overall ,  i recommend this product .  it is a little bulky ,  but if you're someone like me who cannot live without music ,  it's a great product to have if you aren't going to be able to charge your ipod
the camers is good in picture quality and easy to install and use .  it's multi utility for desktop and notepad is a very good feature which i personally expected .  i have a complete satisfaction
yup .  .  .  they connect my cable modem to my router ,  and my router to my computers .  they transmit data back and forth .  so far they have failed to burst into flames or snap off and poke me in the eye .  so go patch cables  ( yay )  .
this reciever is great !   it even gets reception on 6 satelites inside my office building .   i have played with many gps units and have yet to see a reciever do that .  this is a definte buy .   it is extremely accurate also .   i highly recomend it
a good stuff at great price and as usual amazon was fast to send the item
purchased this iterm for my hp8450 printer .  pictures are outstanding and the cartridge does the job . only problem is the cartridge gets eaten up in no time at all .  cost per print no bargain .  problem isn't with the catridge ,  but with the printer and print process .  now we know why hp has printers at such reasonable price .  they eat you up and spit you out via the price of cartidges .  that's where the real profit lies .  amazon is tops in price and service delivery
works better than any other glossy paper i have used with my epson 960
i ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins .   found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway .   originally ,  the dvi-d specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal ,  but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion .   if you need a dvi-d cable ,  an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway .   there are a few  ( very few )  devices that do use all 24 pins ,  but with the advent of hdmi ,  nobody really makes them anymore
it's been through the wringer ,  and has had no problems after about a year .  i came here looking for a replacement cap ,  but can't find one on amazon
excellent sound system ,  reminds you of being in a movie theatre .   great ,  great system
although the rear speakers need a power plug ,  this system solved my problem of being unable to run a signal wire to the back speakers from the front .  the sound is ok ,  not awesome ,  but not bad .  better than the tv speakers by a long shot .  they can also be nicely controlled with my harmony remote
i ordered these headphones from amazon based primarily on user reviews of a number of noise cancelling headphones .  i am quite pleased with my purchase .  though not stellar audiophile quality ,  the sound is pretty darn good ,  and with some minor eq it's excellent .  the noise cancelling effect seems to work very well :  much better than i expected .  furthermore ,  the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed .  i highly recommend them
i have had my axim x51v for about three months .   i purchased it from dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase ,  extra 1100mah battery ,  and auto power cord .strengths :  just about everything .   the processor is absolutely incredible .   i heard  ( unconfirmed )  that the intel 624 mhz pxa270 is faster than a 2ghz pentium 3 !   it sure seems like it .   this pda blazes through movies ,  photos ,  games ,  word processing ,  and anything else i can throw at it .the other definite high point for this pda is the screen .   once you see a vga screen like this ,  you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a qvga screen .   i have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels .   the screen is crystal clear .the battery life is phenomenal ,  even with the standard low capacity battery .   playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours ,  extended to about 4 . 5 hours on low brightness and headphones .   turned off with a 1gb sd card drains the battery about 2% per day .wifi is amazing .   it connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up .   once connected ,  it keeps the signal well and is ,  while not fast ,  reasonable for speedjust about everything on this pda is almost perfect .weaknesses :  not enough programs to start with ,  windows media player 10  ( download tcpmp ,  it's way better )problems :  don't use odyssey client ,  it makes the pda start up really slow .   also ,  in activesync ,  on the pda ,  select menu ,  add server source .   on all of the screens ,  put random characters in each field ,  and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize .   then go to menu ,  schedule and select manual for both .   then go to menu ,  options ,  and delete the entry that you just added  ( the one that has no boxes under it checked )  and delete it .   it fixes a myriad of problems and makes the pda run faster ,  and it still syncs automatically in the cradle .conclusion :  an awesome pda that does just about everything .   combine it with a bt keyboard and perhaps even a bt mouse ,  and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability .   everything works extremely well
the product was easy to load onto my windows based computer using windows xp .   i connected everything as instructed and as soon as i plugged in the tv cable to the back of the modem ,  my internet explorer picked up the signal and put me at the log in page for new accounts of my cable provider .the modem comes with both a usb and 100t ethernet adapter port ,  so use whatever way works best for you .   i tried them both and they appear to work at the same speed .   i am guessing it all depends on the speeds your cable provide is delivering .amazon had the best price on the product if you have the time to wait for their free shipping .   i ordered some stuff from them in the past and the free shipping seemed to take forever .you may want to factor in paying the additional cost for shipping when buying this product if you need it right away .  the price ,  even with the additional shipping charge is still a little less expensive than best buy .   the cost difference between buying it at a best buy store and amazon online will not be much ,  and you'll have to wait a few days to have it in your hands ,  but you get to avoid the drive to the store .   i went this route ,  paid the extra shipping and waited for my package to arrive .   if time is not an issue ,  then use the free shipping method and you will discover that amazons price can't be beat ,  it is the lowest price anywhere .
these are the best portable headphones in this price range .   good bass and smooth ,  natural sound .  in fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price .   if you can afford more ,  consider the sennheiser px100 for about 40-50 dollars .  but if you're on a budget or don't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones ,  these are definitely the ones to get
i love the ishuffle .  it does the job .  not many features ,  but makes my 2-hour commute livable .i put all my podcasts up top and list the songs in alpahbetical order  ( by artist name )  so all is organized .  it's like flying blind ,  but who said blind was impossible ?  certainly not helen keller
first ,  i should say that i'm surprised at how sharp and clear the image is .   the display card at compusa said this monitor has a 1000 : 1 contrast ratio ,  and i'm not sure what that means ,  but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture .   the contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels i looked at ,  which have a contrast ratio of around 500 : 1 to 700 : 1  ( including samsung's own 20 . 1 "  non-widescreen model )  .   everything is crystal-clear ,  which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies .   it is also good for gaming - half-life 2 and unreal tournament 2004 ,  for example ,  both look great .its wide-screen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks .   it also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 4 : 3  ( which makes a square picture centered on the screen )  ,  so if you have any games or other applications that don't support widescreen modes ,  you can use 4 : 3 mode so that the picture doesn't look stretched and distorted .   plus ,  the monitor has dvi ,  analog vga ,  s-video ,  and rca inputs  ( which would allow you to plug in a dvd player if you want )  .   the monitor can also rotate 90 degrees ,  and it has built-in speakers and a headphone jack .being a flat-panel display ,  it is also lightweight and compact ,  which is ideal for areas where space is limited .   this is my first flat-panel display ,  and i was surprised at how lightweight it really is .all of these features ,  especially the sharp image ,  make this a great monitor ,  and it is worth the money
i have to admit ,  i'm a gps junkie .   i've had a variety of gps units over the past decade and currently own 3 - the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving .i am greatly impressed with this unit .   it was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download  ( for those who are interested ,  when a gps unit is turned off and moved a significant distance ,  say 300+ miles ,  from where it last thought it was ,  it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the gps satellites .   this can take a few minutes .  )  in any case ,  after the initial automatic recalibration ,  the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever i turned it on .the user interface is very easy to use .   i've used hertz neverlost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface .   i think garmin's is better .one highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for points of interest  ( poi )  ,  but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating .   this allows you to identify ,  say ,  hotels along your route while you are driving and then ,  using the telephone info provided by the unit ,  to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive -  " let your fingers do the walking .  .  .  "if you don't tell the unit where to look ,  though ,  it can take quite a while to search for a point of interest .   i didn't know which city to specify and i did a search for  " eagle rock rec "   ( i was too lazy to spell out  " eagle rock recreation center "  which turned out to be about 175 miles away )  and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to .   i later realized that even though i didn't know the exact city the destination was in ,  i did know a city that was near the desired destination .   when i specified that information ,  the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location .the advanced user can also create your own poi lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340 .   i have done this for all in-n-out burger and krispy kreme locations .   the advantage to having your own custom pois even though these places are in the built-in poi list is that the custom pois are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels .   if you are a geocacher ,  you can do the same with geocaches ,  but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache .the newer  ( and more expensive )  c5xx units evidently have the sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive ,  allowing signal acquisition indoors ,  but i found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since i have limited my indoor driving lately  : - )  .  i haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet ,  so i might change my tune .   the comparable c5xx unit at this price point ,  the c530 ,  lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities  ( this prevents the c530 from announcing street names )  .since i already have a garmin handheld gps unit as well as garmin's mapsource topo mapping software ,  i used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my mapsource maps for the unit .  i then loaded the topo maps for the entire western us onto an sd card  ( between 300-500 mb )  and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen .   it worked !   so now i have the c340's excellent built-in maps and pois for on-road trips *and* topo maps available to me for off-road adventures .one thing you should do if you are in the us is enable the unit's waas capability  ( the default is for waas to be disabled )  .   enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range .also ,  since this unit has a touch-screen ,  fingerprints on the screen are inevitable .  you should *never* use an ammonia-based product  ( like most window cleaners )  to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog .   instead ,  use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes .   they are cheap and if you don't use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid .i give this unit a highly positive rating .   i like it
this is a great storage device .   i use it to store documents to take with me when i travel and i keep it in my purse .   i love the lanyard ,  that helps me to keep track of the drive .   worth every $$$ i paid for it !
this was a defective unit .  got new unit and it works as expected
i purchased the monster cable mp hts 1000 without reading the reviews ,  ( which i don't usually do )  for the simple reason of where i purchased my hdtv ,  samsung hls-5687w they were trying to sell me but for a $150 ,  which was too much .   i plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound .   i have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable .   that connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop .   after switching around the cables i had a picture again .   i can't really see an improvement in the picture quality  ( hd is beautiful )  i bought the monster basically for the protection
this is a terrific phone .   it has a ton of great features and the three handsets is very convenient .   this is the only phone that i use now .   i only keep one analog phone for power outages .   if you're looking to clean up a little bit of phone clutter this is a great way to do it
i needed a simple solution for my office .  i wanted to be able to use the phone ,  but not get tied down by the handset ,  or the headset .  here was my solution ,  since the ts105b has the 2 . 5mm port for a headset ,  i purchased a jabra a210 bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office .  so far .  .  .  wow !  !  !  its worked out great .  the phone is also good by itself ,  plus it was inexpensive through amazon .  for anyone interested in going the route i took .  .  .  you will not be disappointed .oh yes .  .  .  you are limited to about 25 ft ,  or in my case as i work in a hospital where there are alot of other signals and lead lined walls .  .  .  15ft with max length at about 20 before you begin to hear static .the phone was a great buy ,  as was the jabra a210 adapter .
this is an affordable option that provides a lot of memory and allows usb 2 . 0 protocol for very fast transfer .  if you need to transfer data from one digital product to another ,  this is very handy and i think that every person dealing a lot with data should have one .
i am pleased with this printer .  considering the price ,  it is a good value .  the cartridges are kind of expensive ,  but i guess most cartridges are these days
the unit itself works great .   much faster transfers than using the usb cable directly to my camera .   however ,  the software includes a  " monitoring "  feature ,  which checks every second or so ,  to see if you've plugged in a card .   i opened up windows task manager to discover that ,  each time it checked ,  it was consuming 25% of system resources  ( on/off each second )  .   no wonder my computer has been slower lately ,  especially if i have my image editing software open  ( duh )  .my recommendation would be to skip the san disk software and access the card reader directly from my computer ,  as mentioned in another review below
i have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well .it lives up to its claims .  the  " face tracking "  feature is not always fast and accurate ,  but generaly works  ( in good light )  .this camera does require a significant amount of light to give good results ,  but then again what camera doesn't .image quality is about as good as you will get from this type of device
ordered the ink cartridge and had it within 4 days .   love the service at amazon
i have a gateway cx2610 ,  and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes .   enter this targus lapdesk .   when folded out ,  it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours .but wait ,  there's more !   i had also found my laptop awkward to use at a desk because of the poor ergonomics .   however ,  i use this lapdesk folded with the adjustable leg to reposition the keyboard to a better angle for typing .   it also puts the screen at a better height as well .the desk also works well folded in half with my laptop converted to tablet mode .   so ,  it's a very versatile accessory to go with my versatile laptop .   i highly recommend it
the v200 is another great logitech product .  it is far from the king of the mouse ,  but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this .  it takes two aa batteries  ( so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs )  which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots .  the mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves .  this is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel .  with the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do .  overall the design is good .  there could be a problem installing setpoint .  it may hang on install .  if so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again .  it should work .  the usb receiver is 2 . 4 ghz and has a 10 meter range .  wow .  however there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook .  usb dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off .  for this reason you should have the usb receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand ,  if you can ,  to avoid accidental contact .  it should also not be hanging over the edge of the table .  if you press it down lightly ,  then that is it ,  game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2 . 4 ghz receiver .  so okay you will have to spend on a new receiver ,  if you break the old one .  the receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet .  when it is in the holder the mouse turns off .  it doesn't fit in smoothly .  it creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse .  anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in .  the other thing is that it can pop out sometimes .  just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way .  i am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices .  if you are then a mouse like this and usb should last for a very long time .  there is really nothing wrong with it .  wireless mini mouse .  fab !  however there is one last thing to say .  if you don't like the idea of a usb receiver then get a bluetooth version of this mouse instead .  it is called the v270 .  that is if your notebook has internal bluetooth or else you will need to get a bluetooth usb receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your usb receivers .  but if you have a bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the v270 and forget about this usb option .  the usb design isn't a fault with the mouse ;  it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault .  you just got to switch to internal bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers .
this phone was an additional phone for the model ip811-2 phone system used for vonage .  this system has every feature that i could want ,  including range and quality ,  there are no negatives .  i am highly recommending this phone and system
not a bad battery deal .  while they don't last as long as some other batteries i've tried ,  their cost per battery more than makes up for it .  for those that care about such things ,  they contain no mercury ,  no cadmium ,  and are made in china
so far i havent filled up my disc yet using it .   thedisc that came with it would fill up after 3 minutes oftalking .   so far its great
i purchased this cable solely to connect my gpsmap 76s to my hp laptop .   so far it has performed perfectly .   i have not tried to use it for other applications yet ,  so i can't comment on how well it would work in other situations .
i'm very happy with the kensington sx 2000 .  i listen mostly to jazz and the midrange is as good as the higher end bose or apple speaker systems .  pumping up the volume does not distort in any way either .  plus ,  i have my speaker on a divider that equally services both ends of the open space
i burn a ton of dvds and have used almost every brand out there .   many have errors ,  even the top brand names like memorex .  .  . etc .i have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting .i've switched all dvd media purchases to verbatim .   they are by far ,  the best of them all .   would recommend to everyone
i bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items i need to carry back and forth  ( umbrella ,  lunch ,  spare battery ,  paper ,  etc )  .   it's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations .   its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally .   i was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward ,  but it's not .my only minor complaint is that the buckles on the shoulder straps slip gradually and need to be tightened every couple of days
this box is perfect to have all the basic ipod accesories at once .  i have the 60 mb video ipod and all the accesories works perfect
as long as i own a pair of these headphones ,  i will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again .   they sound perfect .   i cannot fathom a more balanced ,  natural sound .   these babies put you in the recording studio ,  or in the concert hall !   bass is crisp ,  taut ,  and strong .  you can feel it .  yet it is not overbearing or boomy .  midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist ,  and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes .  the folding feature is handy .the only things to be aware of are the following :   first ,  you have to break them in .   they start sounding better after a few hours of use .   second ,  they don't have an inline volume control ,  which i will dearly miss from my koss ktxpro1s .   finally ,  plenty of sound escapes .   so don't crank them too much in the library or at grandma edith's funeral .other than that ,  you have no excuse .   put your ipod's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong ,  and order these  ( or if you don't want to fork out $40 ,  order the koss ktx pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these ,  and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range .  )
i purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for herhp pavilion notebook pc  ( dv5139us )  ,  screen size 15 . 4 "  ,  ht 1 . 8 "  ,  wdth 14 . 1 "  ,  depth 10 . 4  "  .  the bag is for personal use ,  not business ,  and use will be moderate .  she did want some extra compartments for organization .this case has met all her needs ,  it is light weight ,  constructed of durable material ,  well organized .  her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease .  she is satisfied with this purchase .  we would recommend purchasing this case .
there's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this sony dvd player when you can view or download ,  for free ,  the user's manual at http : //esupport . sony . com/us/perl/model-documents . pl ? mdl=dvpns90v&loc=3 .  i've been running this sony dvp-ns90v player through a sony widescreen hdtv and a pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now ,  and i find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers .  one ,  for example ,  states that there is  " no bass management ,  "  yet you can  ( a )  route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting  " small "  or  " large "  for the front speaker size  ( see page 76 of the user's manual )  ,  and also  ( b )  increase or decrease the bass from -15 db to +5 db  ( see page 77 of the manual )  .  whether you prefer analog to digital audio ,  or you think sacd's are tops ,  is a matter of opinion ,  taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit .  i ,  for one ,  prefer dvd-audio ,  and i mention this for an important reason :  some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit  " will not play dvd-audio discs .  "  happy surprize :  it most certainly will !  for my dvd-a's that have optional dolby 5 . 1 and/or dts tracks ,  the player simply ignores the primary dvd-a format  ( normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors )  but still plays the dolby or the dts via the digital audio  ( optical or coaxial )  connectors .  for  " pure "  dvd-a's  ( without dolby 5 . 1 or dts tracks )  ,  it conveniently outputs the audio both via the 6 analog and the digital connectors .  and in all cases above ,  the audio is full multi-channel surround ,  and not downmixed to 2-channel pcm ,  nor prologic pseudo-surround .  the only dvd-a function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on dvd-a's ,  and so displays only the  " jacket image "  onscreen .  the quick setup allows any dvd newbie to be up and running in a short time .  and the custom setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks .  in short ,  you'll find this to be a superior universal player ,  provided you read the user's manual  ( all 84 pages of it !  )  ,  follow it ,  and connect equally high-quality ,  compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features
i read the other reviews and don't understand where they are coming from unless they are all by at&t or bell employees .   i've had vonage for 3 years and have nothing but good things to say about it .   i have local numbers for seattle ,  salt lake city ,  boston and san francisco so my friends can stay in touch .  these numbers only cost me $4 . 99/each a month .   customer service is excellent .   they stay right on the phone with you until everything works perfectly .   this is especially nice after they added 911 service
wow ,  who would've thought that you could get such amazing products ,  at affordable prices .   the staff's friendly and responds quickly to any questions that you may have .   this is one amazing phone system  ( uniden tcx905 )  ,  i forgot that it's a cordless .
work fine with my hp pavillion zd7050 .  increase the performance of my laptop
netgear clearly has not figured out how to make their rangemax adapter work well with the microsoft xp operating system .   if you're not a techie ,  i'd stay away until microsoft has certified the wpn311 .  here's what i experienced :1 .  installed using the netgear wpn311 automated configuration .2 .  after installation completion and boot up ,  cpu utilization was at a solid 100% .   executable from netgear named wlancfg5 . exe taking up a bunch of the cpu and microsoft routines csrss . exe ,  net . exe ,  and net1 . exe taking the rest .3 .  emailed netgear and received response to use task manager to delete wlancfg5 . exe .   did so for all users .4 .  hey !   cpu utilization returned to normal !5 .  sent next email to netgear pointing out that this solution is just a  " patch "  and wlancfg5 would return when i re-booted .6 .  received response to de-install and re-install software for wpn311 .7 .  did so ,  but then netgear adapter software could not find my mimo wireless router !   and usage of the netgear adapter software doesn't allow you to use the microsoft wireless zero configurator  ( wzc )  .8 .  went to microsoft . com and looked up error 871122  " error message when you try to run the wireless network setup wizard "  and followed the instruction to allow usage of wzc .9 .  then able to add my wireless router and everything is ok .the functionality works great .   it's the getting there that's not too pretty good .  .  .  .  .
we received our dlp tv stand in record time .   we had wanted to get it for a new tv that was being delivered that weekend .   we ordered on i think a tuesday and it was at our office on friday .   it was in excellent shape and we had no trouble putting it together .   the tv fit perfectly !
i just bought a refurbished roadmate 700 a few days ago .  it took minutes to locate my current location ,  which was totally normal .i kinda feared that i would have the gps with the older version 3 . 2 ,  as some people said earlier .  but in fact ,  the one that i got is with firmwave version 4 . 32 ,  the newest version .  the voice is working good too .i am happy with this product ,  even though it is a refurbished one
i purchased the pouch & the carring case shortly after .  i own more than one car and have four family menbers that are always on the go . the case holds the gps ,  mount and all the different cables . the foam insert holds the gps while still in the pouch or without . the velcro staps hold the mount & the ac cord . this way when you are looking for it , everthing is in one place . the case is made well and very plain looking on the outside , so not to draw any attention
i bought the transcend 1 gbyte card for my pda .  my axim x51v immediately recognized it and is working flawless for the past few weeks .  i am planning to get the 4gb model too which is currently retailing for $90 to $110 elsewhere .har
for those of you who bought minidisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording ,  this product is wonderful .   especially good for recording lectures ,  voice lessons ,  etc .   it works quite well with the built-in mono mike ,  or you could use an external one .one of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section .i record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station's tape deck to my iriver .for those who recorded live music with their minidiscs ,  it's a little trickier .   you have to set the record input before -- you can't change it on the fly .i've recorded live dj shows with the built-in and agc on .   of course ,  the booming bass distorts horribly ,  but overall an easy record of the show .   very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show .i've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results .   a bit of trial and error which i'm still refining with later iriver products .the single aa batter lasts a good long time .   summer school involves 2 ,  2-hour classes ,  and i can record several days of them before battery is low .   if the battery runs out during recording ,  fear not ,  the file is saved !the negatives are the requirement to go through the special iriver music program ,  but there are now firmware updates that will change your iriver into the typical usb external drag-and-drop drive .files are recorded in a  . rec file which one then converts to a  . mp3 file after transfer to your computer .   i don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the  . mp3 file .   but you can't trasnfer  . mp3 files off your iriver ,  even if you made them yourself ,  so don't think you can use this to transfer  . mp3 files from one computer to another .also ,  the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some rca to 1/8 "  adaptors ,  so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way .i've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day ,  whether just playing mp3s or recording classes .   i'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button .   after so many presses ,  it's starting to wear out .   but it's still working reliably .   i just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention .i have the 1g model  ( ifp-799 )  which is great .   i was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon i produced with it .   previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs .i'm quite happy with iriver and plan on buying from them in the future
my old dvd would not play some of the many new formats ,  i . e .  dvd-r ,  etc .  this unit plays every dvd i've put in it with no hassles .  the vcr has an auto tracking adjustment feature that seems to be fool proof ,  no stutters or static in the sound .   and the icing on the cake is the remote .   i understand it !   plus it controls my television functions .   excellent price and standard excellent amazon service .   well done
i bought this because my windshield suction mount could not be trusted .   i've had it fall off more than once .   then you drive around wondering if your $700 nuvi is going to fall and break .   not fun !   the friction mount works for me .  for everyday driving ,  even aggresive driving ,  it stays put .   someone on this site left feedback about using it with their nuvi 360 and i used their review to make the purchase .   i'm glad i did .
two of these jewel cases equal the size of a regular cd case .  buy them and conserve space .  there great
the convenience of this product is terrific .   whenever i show people how it snaps in half ,  they're amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one .   now that all computers have usb ports ,  i can put my photos into any computer anytime i want without worrying about the docking station .   a must-have product for every digital camera !  !
around here canon ink is difficult to locate and expensive when you actually find someone who carries it .  it may take a week or two to arrive using amazon's free shipping option ,  but i get fantatstic results from my canon pixma mp780  ( that i also bought from amazon )  .  most of my printing is borderless 8 1/2x11 and the quality is always great .  definitely worth it .   if turnaround time is a problem ,  buy two so you always have a spare .
easy to install and use but the remote does not have an on/off switch
i am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys .  i bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out .  i first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome .  i could hear things in songs i have never heard before .  i then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like .  to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp .  there was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good .  the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you .  i am glad i got these instead of the 650's cause my friend owned the 650's and if you don't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck
nicely designed leather case w/ belt clip .   i bought this for my hp hx2415 .   pockets good for sd memory cards .   belt clip hooks very tightly to belt ,  so you don't have to worry about dropping pda .
this is the 2nd gamepad i've owned  ( my first pc was in 1993 )  .   the 1st gamepad was the gravis gamepad  ( 4-button + d-pad )  .   i recently upraded and there is no game/midi port on the new system ,  plus i need more buttons for need for speed most wanted ,  etc .i love this controller .   i've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results .   i've only used it in nfs games  ( i have them all )  .the wifi works flawlessly and i have a wifi network in my house .   installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins .the rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software .  this is totally understandable .   the feedback in nfs-mw is very slight but that's not the controllers fault ,  it's a matter of programming by ea games .i like the weight of the controller .   it's not feather light ,  so with that motor and battery weight added ,  it feels more like a premium device  ( just like the 67$ with tax i paid for it - canadian dollars )  .   i didn't like how my gravis gamepad as so light ,  so this is a step up .the analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel .   they are rubber gripped for non-slip action .   i am used to the d-pad ,  so i have mine setup in nfs to use both as a directional control without having to press the mode button to switch because you don't have time during a race to press a button before switching .it works as well as my old gamepad ,  but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money .   if you in the usa ,  you'll be getting a much better deal .   it lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ us in the states .cons :it's not as comfortable to hold as i would like but its much better than my gravis gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one .conclusion :i'm very satisfied overall and i knew i may have to get used to the way it feels when i hold this controller since changing from the old snes style gravis gamepad .4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold
this is my second fm transmitter and works much better than the belkin that i ended up returning because it simply wasn't working .it plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there ,  unlike the belkin  ( i drive a 2001 bmw 325ci )  .  it is easy to use with the preset fm stations .  it works right out of the box ,  you'll be ready to go within seconds .  the sound is crisp ,  with some static interference ,  which can be expected in a big city .  unmounting my car's antenna helps a little but doesn't completely cure the interference .  i have a factory bmw business radio which picks up fm signals pretty much without an antenna .there is nothing to mount the ipod so you'll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately .i wouldn't spend more than $45 on any fm transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas .  i won't be getting rid of my cd changer just yet
let me just preface this review by mentioning that i read many customer reviews ( here and elsewhere )  on this product before purchasing it .  i focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws .  after using this keyboard for almost 6 months i believe that saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality .command pad :  many reviews bash this feature .  it is quite a basic pad as compared to some ,  but it gets the job done .  my only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrl-alt-delete .  during games such as wow and cod2 i had no problems whatsoever .  the rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me .  the customers who claimed it to be  " impossible "  and  " buggy "  seem to be computer illiterate at best ,  and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews ,  possible english illiterate as well .  if you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad .keyboard :  the quietness ,  response ,  and overall feel of the keys rival any logitech design .  i am a huge fan/customer of logitech equipment ,  and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality .  saitek took a more simple route with this design ( no lcd screen etc .  .  .  )  and the price shows it .*i almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of key-symbol illumination .  it is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased .  unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge .  i would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved .last and probably least comes the aesthetics ,  of course the most subjective part of any review .  i found this setup to be very sharp looking .  in the dark ,  the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for .  this eliminates the need for symbol illumination .  although symbol illumination might be a nice touch ,  especially for the keyboard deficient ,  i feel that saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering .  i have lost some lettering on logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months i've been using this one ( although frequency of gaming has fluctuated )  .  saitek engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination ,  apparently an oversight on their part .i will recap this lengthy review by recommending this keyboard to any capable computer enthusiast who desires a good value .
i ordered the 2 gb card twice .  .  .  . fast shipping and both worked perfectly
this isn't my first mp3 player .  i have a couple of the years and since my last one died i was looking for a quick ,  cheap replacement .  i also needed a flash drive for work .  don't underestimate this ,  if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1 .  not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2 .  you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port ,  which gets annoying quickly .  when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you .  with this you get both in one .  it has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems ,  even win98 .  the sound quality is good ,  i can't tell the difference between this and my $100 . 00 player .  the controls do take a few seconds to get used to ,  but once i did i find i preferred them .  they are easy to use one-handed .an unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks !  if you turn off the player ,  it starts back up exactly where you left it ,  be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter !  its small without being too tiny ,  its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heart-attack .  its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature ,  but if you need to carry more than an album or 2 ,  or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway .the best feature is the price .  i found this one at my local toysrus for $15 . 00 .  it also plays both mp3's and wma .  it won't play aac but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod .this would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles .i'm giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what i need it to do without any hassle
when i first came across this particular microphone i had my doubts .  considering the price of it i just couldn't see it holding up for what i wanted to do .  to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations .  for recording vocals this mic is amazing .  a real professional sound for a extremely low price .  i definitely recommend this mic to anyone out there looking for an in expensive way to make professional sounding material
this was the largest set that would fit into my space .  i also looked at the westinghouse 37 inch hd moniter at best buy .  the first time ,  i looked at the westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy .  then i read the review on cnet which said the westinghouse picture was actually better than the sharp .  i went back to best buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the westinghouse could be improved .  he said it was as it good as it could be .  he than said the sharp was twice the price of the westinghouse ,  so i should expect a better picture on the sharp . in any event ,  i purchased the sharp on amazon during the recent electronic express sale .  on hd ,  the picture is amazing .  it's also quite good on regular tv .my only regret is that toshiba has just come out with a 37inch lcd with a dvd built in .  if i  had known ,  i would have waited to check out that model
this is my first time ever buying a really expensive mp3 player .   i bought it three weeks ago .   if i hadn't seen the creative zen vision : m ,  i probably would have bought the sandisk sansa e260 .   i love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv .   there is one problem i've had with it .   i'm not sure if anyone else has had this ,  but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when i'm listening to music .   i don't think it's the mp3s ,  because i've never ran into the problem with my other mp3 players .   if only they would've added the video cable for the tv and kept the charger ,  then i would've rated it a 5
i had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it .  it had gotten very good reviews .  ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some .  highly recommend it
this unit is a good buy .   it is priced low ,  but functions like you paid a higher price .   the negatives are that it isn't compatible with itunes ,  and the earphones are not very ergonomically designed .   overall ,  it is a good product
i'm very happy with this model .  i use it mostly as a vcr replacement to record broadcast tv shows .  you can't beat the price for this feature-set .  i'll try to describe some aspects that aren't mentioned in the other reviews .  the owner's manual can also be found online in pdf format .it can schedule upto 16 programs .  it does not support vcr+ or a tvio-style program guides .  you can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus .  it even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk .  every on-screen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen .the commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough ,  but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well .  the remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players .my only complaint :  the remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on right-hand side .  when the unit is in our video cabinet ,  the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room .  we can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall .  of course this probably means nothing to you .at the highest quality setting  ( xp )  it made a very good  ( near perfect i'd say )  copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs .  at that setting ,  only one hour of content fits on a dvd .  the next lower setting  ( sp )  which can hold two hours per disk ,  the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems .  most tv shows recorded in ep  ( 8 hrs )  are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times .  this is especially pronounced on animated shows .  the four-hour lp setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded tv .  it also has a flex-mode option i haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality .   probably would be good for recording a tv movie .it's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the -ram format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media ,  but it won't play on most other equipment .  the other formats seem lame by comparison ,  but this unit can play and record on them .watching one show while another is recording  ( or the same show that's recording ,  but from the beginning )  is very easy to do .  most of the operations are very sensible and explained on-screen pretty well ,  but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before .  it can do a lot of stuff .one interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using ,  the signal is sent through the s-video output .it can't burn music cd's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add .  that and a battery backup  ( so i won't lose my schedule )  and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star
lenmar is great to work with ,  when beach audio will not do exchanges for faulty equipment .  beach audio told me i would need to purchase another one then when they get the faulty one back they would refund my money for the second one that i had to purchase .  poor return policy .  so i just sent it to lenmar under the warranty and they sent me a new one .  only took one week to get it .  go lenmar .i've been able to watch on a 10in .  portable dvd two  ( 2hr )  movies on just this battery with a little to time to spare .  ***nice battery***
i love this keyboard .after searching through just about every keyboard available ,  i was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price .  i'm so glad that i chose this one .it is excellent !  the quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want .  it's a great keyboard for gaming ,  office use ,  media or just ordinary ,  everyday use .they keystrokes are effortless and near silent .  the slide zoom feature is cool ,  but i don't use it much .  it's better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though .i really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files ,  e-mail or web pages with immediate ease .  the only thing i don't like about this keyboard is the sleep button .  i never use this and i can't see any way to reasign it .  however ,  it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard .aside from all of that ,  how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price .  and it was delivered the day after i ordered it .to top it off ,  it feels sturdy and well made .  i would reccomend this keyboard to anyone .  it is a great all around keyboard with either usb or ps2 connectability
i have case logic cd wallets from 7+ years ago that are still in good shape .  .  . despite the abuse i put them through .   i bought this one only because of cd collection expansion .  i find simply wiping off the outside cover with a wet sponge keeps it clean .  the nylon covers really hold up over time .  remember- the  " 128 cd capacity "  refers to cds without their accompaning booklets .  it's really 64 cds with booklets .
i have been using this card for last 6 months ,  no problem so far .  rebate takes some time to arrive
i've been using this cf card on my nikon 4300 for a couple of months now .   it writes fast compared to my other cf  ( canon stock ,  from another camera )  .   however ,  start up of the camera takes longer  ( because of the size )  ,  and as more pictures are stored ,  there is a noticeable degradation in speed in writing .   i've also used this on a dell axim ,  and it worked great !   no problem in formatting
this is the rockinest think i've ever seen or buyed dudes !  !  !  check it ou
i bought this phone at amazon ,  and i am happy with it .  provides very good sound quality ,  comfortable navigation , address book and caller id . with its 5 . 8 ghz frequency speed ,  it is much better than my previous one which was panasonic 2 . 4ghz and did not have light signal on handset when you have a new message .
i'm a jogger ,  and like to listen to all things considered while i run miles and miles .  this radio is great because the light weight is unobtrusive .  it has a convenient  " lock "  button to prevent accidentally changing the station with a bump .  i previously had a similar size unit from aiwa ,  this sony has much much better reception
i have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year .  i have been very happy with them ,  and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup .the good :  they are not only noise-cancelling ,  but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear ,  blocking more noise .  if you put them on without any audio source ,  in only dulls background noise ,  but i think that's the best you can expect from any pair .  while listening to audio ,  nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it .  there is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side .  you put it around your neck like a necklace ,  put the buds in your ears ,  and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece .the bad :  nothing is actually  " bad "  about them ,  but they're not quite perfect .  the earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating ,  or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax .  however ,  they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds .  i do this daily when i use them .  however ,  that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging .  once one starts slipping ,  it generally won't stay in well until it  ( and your ears )  have been cleaned ,  which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect .other thoughts :  the cord is plenty long enough to reach an ipod or whatever at about belt level .  however ,  if the player is in a pants pocket ,  it could be a little close .  also ,  i often wear it when i'm not using it ,  because you can forget it's there ,  and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled .  i had an issue once because i was sitting at a desk ,  and it dangled to the floor .  when i stood up ,  i stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- i began to get a slight buzz in one ear .  however ,  i blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug .i bought mine at target ,  where they were labelled $24 . 99 ,  on  " clearance "  from $49 . 99 .  a couple of months later they were back to $49 . 99 .  once they dropped again to $34 . 99  ( another  " clearance "  price )  ,  i bought a second pair as a backup .  i'm glad i did -- i'm still using the second pair .  battery life is great .  i don't know how many hours i get ,  but i can go at least a couple of weeks using my ipod for at least a couple of hours per day ,  listening to podcasts and audiobooks
i have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them .   i had purchased this one to replace my 2 . 4ghz uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer .   this one doesn't .   i also like the feature of the intercom feature .   my daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she isn't on the phone ,  i can contact her to talk to her .my daughter also likes the mute feature where she can put somebody on hold if she is on the phone to ask me a question so that person on the other end doesn't hear her .the phone has many other features but those are 2 usefule ones i like along with the caller id
a little bouncy while running ,  but a convenient product .   fits perfectly around all of my mp3 players  ( large and small )
like most people here ,  i found the bose triport headphones to have excellent sound but the plastic on mine also broke in the recess next to the earcups .   what i found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic .   in fact ,  the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended .my recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted ,  to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic .   bose replaced them with no hassles ,  no receipt ,  no registration ,  just sent them back and got a brand new pair .   i think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago
i love the mobilemate sd .   i haven't had any problems yet .   it's small compact and gets the job done
memorex dvd+r's are the best .  price keeps dropping and never have a problem
i really love my garim gps 12 .  it is easy to use and move between screens and features .  the summit is not as easy to use .  it is not as convenient to identify way points ,  does not work with mapping software and its display is to simple .  it was not a step up but sideways .  i use it in conjunction with my gps 12 mostly just to keep the track log
i bought these for my dvd player .   they work wonderfully !   the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but  [ didn't measure up }  .   these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies ,  especially the dialogue .   the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled .   but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever .   for those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound ,  i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds
this item does exactly what it's suppose to do .  it also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception .  worth the money .  only drawback would be ,  there is a lot of cord hanging around
i just recently purchased the quickcam stx for my sister who lives overseas in greece .  it's a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis .  surprisingly ,  the video and audio is quite good .  i do have a mac and she doesn't have any issue calling me from her pc .   we use aol instant messenger  ( video and audio )  or yahoo messenger  ( video )  to connect .   i still prefer the isight for macs .   unfortunately ,  you can't use an isight on a pc .  wish apple could make the isight compatible with pc's .  anyhow the stx is a great cam for what it's worth .
i bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now .  the nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works ,  it works beautifully .  when it doesn't work ,  it is erratic and locks up .  turn it on and off and while the led will light up ,  it will still not work well .  this is the hint that the battery is low .  the mouse comes with two rechargable nimh aaa batteries .  these are 650mah batteries and are not the best .  i bought 4 1000mah accupower nimh batteries .  i keep 2 in the charger .  these batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day .  but as soon the mouse starts to get erratic ,  you have to swap the batteries .  do this and you will really like this mouse .another nice feature for this mouse is the range .  you can use your laptop as a dvd player connected to your tv and sitting out of the way .  the mouse makes a nice remote control
we bought this product for a long car trip and the kids loved it .  i've also used it and thought the sound and picture were wonderful .  it was exactly what we were looking for and for a fantastic price !  we are very happy
the logitech mx 400 mouse in my opinion was a good buy .   it is very reliable ,  accurate ,  scrolls smooth ,  and is precise and responsive on every surface i have used it on .   it is also light weight and comfortable ,  making it the purfect mouse for the price
it helps proteck your ipod veary well .  i already broke one ipod some how but with this case it well never happen agai
for the price is is great .it's working fine but the plastic is not solid and has a feeling of low quality .
this cable is of the best quality ,  quick shipment and at a price that beats all the retail stores - you can't go wrong
we purchased the ysp-1 in august as a companion to our hitachi ultravision wall-mounted television .   what a fabulous piece of audio equipment !when we began searching for a replacement for our infiniti surround system ,  my husband and i had different concerns .   he is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and i was ready for aestethic simplicity  ( no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere )  .   when we found the ysp-1 we thought it was too good to be true .   one speaker instead of five ?   wall-mounted ?   doesn't take up any floor space ?   we visited two yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves .   one had the ysp-1 set up in a room environment .   the other ,  on the salesroom floor .   in both set-ups it performed consistantly .   in both demonstrations however ,  my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement .   so ,  we made the purchase and opted to use the ysp-1 with our existing subwoofer .   installation was fairly simple ,  provided you have the necessary tools .   the most important ,  and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television .   now that it is installed and in use in our home ,  i feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer .   my husband though ,  prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound .   more than movies the sound quality you get when listening to cds is absolutely stunning .   overall ,  we both got what we wanted .   expert sound designation and sleek ,  minimalistic styling  ( with the added bonus of more floor and wall space )  .
the first week i had these ,  the left earpiece's plastic  " rails "  which hold the earpiece in its slot broke .   the parts that seem to need the most strength structurally are fasioned with cheap plastic .sound quality is great ,  with music playing and noise cancelling active ,  a normal conversation is barely audible in the background ;  great for crowded offices .   battery life is good ,  i've gotten 24+ hours using a nimh rechargeable
this is a very good skin for 60 gb & 80 gb owners .   it completely covers the entire ipod without sacrificing functionality .   what separates this skin from other skins it the visor  ( a plastic shield which protects the screen )  .   my only problem with this skin is the belt clip .   it is impossible to remove and difficult to use .   a better belt clip would make this the perfect skin .   this is a very good price from techgnet .
i must say moster xp speaker wire makes a huge sound inprovement on mt 6 . 1 home theater setup my side and rear channels are so clear and crisp  .i have these runing threw my walls and ceiling and the intall was a brezz do the jacket by these cables you will love them for your surond speakerswayne mn
a memory stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a sony camera - fantastic
this is the same cartridge i can purchase elsewhere ,  but cheaper .   it works well in our printer with no issues whatsoever and my hp printer prints fantastic photos when i use hp ink and hp premium photo paper
i was considering purchasing a tablet and wacom was consistantly recommended .   i was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because i didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line  ( the intuos line )  .   i was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong .   installing a driver was a piece of cake and i began drawing away in minutes .   it is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs  ( paintshop pro ,  painter ,  photoshop )  .   the mouse is pretty useless however ,  and i would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead  ( they seem to wear out ,  though i do press pretty hard )  .   other than that ,  its an amazing product
yeah ,  so apparently this was a really good pda to buy .  i bought this three years ago and it still works !  ive been searching for a new pda since i thought this one was so out of date ,  and when reading all the reviews i came across many new  " state of the art "  pdas that broke after only a few months .  this baby has been great to me for three long years ,  so if you are looking for a reliable buy ,  go for this .  definately not flashy ,  very basic .  all i use it for is appointments ,  dates ,  and to-dos .  great for students who want to use a pda as an agenda !good luck on your pda search !
this laser version tracks much better on odd surfaces compared to the logitech v200 i have .the setpoint software allows you to use setpoint's mouse sensativity independent of the touchpad settings .   finally !  !  !   i dont have to change mouse sensativities when i unplug it .   the setpoint sensativity is an offset to window's sensativity setting for the touchpad .   so basically ,  set your touchpad sensativity first ,  then adjust the setpoint sensativity .   they will be work just the way you want everytime you unplug/plug the mouse and going back and forth between touchpad and mouse .perfect product
this does exactly what it is supposed to do .   it is light ,  easy to pack ,  easy to use ,  and probably difficult to crack .( though would-be pc pilferers haven't tried taking a hacksaw to my cable lock so i cannot comment as to its ability to withstand saws ,  blow-torches ,  or any other criminal's tool .  )other reviewers baffled me as mine is as described by amazon .   there is neither an alarm nor batteries .   why bother with an alarm if the pc is locked with steel cable ?   seems like overkill
this is the perfect keyboard  (  i know cuz i am typing on it right now  )  i recommend if you like media boards
i am very pleased with the quality of the product .   i have burned about a dozen discs and have had zero coasters .   after the rebate ,  the price was very competitive
i had a game that would not even play on the xbox because it was so scratched .  after using the game dr .  it works perfectly .  it is like i bought a brand new game .  the game dr .  was pretty easy to use too
this product took less than 5 minutes to unbox ,  install ,  and work properly .  well built ,  and functions exactly as i would have hoped .  i am impressed with the ability of the suction cup to stay attached ,  even in the summer heat of las vegas
the ink toner i received was exactly as described and was delivered in a timely fashion .
have had no problems with this item ,  and it's a good price for the powered kind of usb hubs ,  which i have found are pretty necessary for most usb items .
just spent the weekend photographing and video recording lots of activity and didn't even get close to capacity .this is fantastic
works good for me .  some time one can hear some interference but over all a pretty good product
i'll try to keep this short and sweet .   if you have been frustrated trying to get am reception on the go ,  then you've found the right radio for you .   i can't tell you how many pieces of junk i've bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close am stations unless i constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception .    luckily  (  ?  )  those other radios also died pretty quickly .  this sangean product solves the am reception problem and seems very durable .  i also own their ccradio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation .   i love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker ,  just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60's--a seemingly forgotten feature .   as for listening through the supplied earphones ,  forget it .  sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied .   never have i heard tinnier sound ,  even for am listening .   not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short .   i immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin .   now i happily and easily listen to am and fm stations even over the roar of the lawnmower .    there might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to fm exclusivey ,  but if you spend even a little time on the am dial ,  i really don't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio
i had bought one of these five years ago when i was in the states and am still happily using it at home .  unbelievably durable for a mouse pad heavily used for hours everyday for five full years .  fed up with giveaway mouse pads sliding with my hand movements ,  i was searching for something decent to use in the office and amazingly found the exact same item .  it is a good example that how little things make a big difference
the things i like most :1 .  my recorded greetings  ( two greetings allowed )  and my caller's messages are clear and clean .2 .  the unit's appearance and styling is sleek and modern .  the controls layout is good with everything in view and accessible on the top .  my last machine had some of its controls on the sides causing me to have to pick it up and turn it around and around looking for a particular control .  this machine is better in that respect .3 .  learning to use it is a very easy and intuitive process especially if you have used other machines .  the included instructions clearly explain how to use its less obvious features .things i didn't like :  nothing ,  really .but some minor annoyances include :1 .  the electronic accent of the generated voice of the machine was a little hard to understand at first .  but i quickly  " learned "  its accent .  your callers will never hear it after you record your own greeting which will be clear and sound like you .  otherwise ,  your callers will hear a default message in the machine's voice .2 .  i installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into ac .  removing the battery ,  then plugging in the ac ,  then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally .  the battery installation instructions and general installation instructions did not indicate any particular installation sequence requirements regarding the battery
unit's range shorter than expected ,  but i feel that i got what i wanted ,  and paid for .  shipping and delivery were great
i bought this ipod 4g to replace my 2g one that got stolen and chose more memory as the 2g got filled up too quickly .  can say that this is probably the best size in terms of memory .  otherwise ,  as usual with macs ,  very easy to use ,  even for low-tech people like myself ,  beautiful design ,  small and light ,  not too fragile ,  just great on the go
all 3 kids have a tunebase .   it works great ,  easy to use .   it also charges the ipod while we travel
unit works great ,  heats up fast ,  easy to clean ,  and much better built than the typical discount store models .  it looks like this willlast a long time
reliable and functions .   much less expensive than  " ionic breeze "  or other yuppie products one might get at the s . i .  has three fan settings and is very quiet .   doesn't stir up dust and blow it around like a traditional fan does .   only draw back is that it does not have a filter .
like many homemakers ,  i generally leave fixture installation to the man of the house .   my husband refused to drill into our metal doors in order to install conventional curtain rods .   i went without curtains over our kitchen doorway for years and always felt that something was missing .   these magnetic curtain rods solved that problem .   the rod holders attach magnetically without screws or bolts .   the holders have never shifted out of place and have not scuffed or scratched my door .   the curtain rods are stable enough to hold heavy canvas curtains .  i installed the set in a moment's time with very little effort .   my husband was surprised and thrilled that i found a way to hang curtains without marring the metal surface of the door .
i purchased this item in aug .    i cleaned the entire house and it worked wonderful .   it was easy to put together and very easy to clean up when finished .    i give this item a 5 star .
the villaware panini grill has proved to be a very useful appliance ,  so much so that i leave it out on the counter - it's quite attractive ,  and certainly not an eyesore .   i use it often ,  for grilled sandwiches ,  of course ,  but also for grilled meats and fish .   i would caution users to avoid meat with bones ,  e . g .  lamb chops ( you can't get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill )  ,  and to be very careful about timing :  things get done twice as fast !   while the cleaning  " comb "  is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill ,  you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately ;  much easier to do if the grill is warm  ( not hot )  .   i haven't tried grilling vegetables ,  yet ,  but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way ,  or eggplant ,  or peppers .i am very happy with the quality of this product
i have used a brita filter water pitcher for many years ,  and i love it !  the directions clearly state not to use hot water ,  and the filter snaps into place in order for the water to filter through properly .  when my daughter visits ,  she says ,  &quot ; i'd like a glass of brita water ! &quot ;   :
i love my vienna deluxe !   we've been using it for 4-8 coffees per day for 7 months now and have certainly saved money over going to the coffee shop .   if you plan to buy more than 100 coffees  ( for us about 3 months worth )  it already pays for itself and the coffee tastes better .   the flavor of the coffee is awesome and it's super easy to make .the only bad thing i can say about this coffee machine is that the 'key' in the back of it got a little bit off and we had to manually turn it so that the brew unit would fit back in .   it only took us about 2 hours to figure out and fix it ,  so it wasn't that big of a deal .if you're looking for something that is a super high class ,  fancy ,  heavy duty ,  professional style coffee maker ,  maybe you should spring for the superdeluxe big bucks model and drop a couple grand .   people have given this model low reviews for being expensive and made of plastic .   ours still looks nice ,  is easy to clean ,  and doesn't weigh 750 million pounds .   it seems like folks are looking for a chrome and steel starbucks style coffee maker for $500 ,  and that just isn't realistic .this is a great buy and it makes great coffee
this is a great device and has multiple settings to keep tasks on track .   very full featured and easy to use
when you bake with the bavaria pan ,  you can be sure that the finished product is consistent in shape everytime .  the pan bakes evenly and there is a crispness of form when the cake is unmolded
there are all kinds of similar products that claim to be heat resistant to this or that temp .  all i can say is these spatulas are the real deal when it comes to heat resistance and at a great price .  i only wish there were a 3rd somewhat smaller blade .  however ,  you can't go wrong with these first two sizes .
i love this product  ,  the processor is small but enough for a home kitchen and it doesn't take up much space .  it chops  ,  shred  ,  slice but the bad thing is sometimes when making sticky stuff ,  the stuff goes under the thing that holds the blade and its extremly hard to get out .  the other bad thing is the plastic  ,  everytime i use the processor the smell of what i'm making last in the plastic bowl and won't go away until i make something else .  and i did clean it very hard .  overall i do recommend this product to all
i just recently purchased this little knife set at a local department store and paid $10 . 00 for the set .  i love these things !  at amazon's price of $3 . 99 i added a second set to another order and i am eagerly awaiting their arrival .  i would recommend these knives to anyone .   they are such a good deal ,  in my opinion
i just received this as a wedding gift and it is beautiful !   a great gift
just compare this one with braun ,  try to turn it on without the coffee beans and you would notice braun is louder than toastmaker ,  this is quiet and grinds well .  just got it a month ago ,  not sure about the life of the machine .  but i believe its cheap and best
i got this to use with the glorious one pot meals cookbook .   it has wonderful recipies ,  and the pot works wonderful .   cleans up really easy .   try it ,  you'll love it .sharon from colorad
i have owned at least six other coffee pots and was never satisfied with home made coffee ,  so dunkin donuts was where i would head to on my way to work .   i got this coffee pot and i buy dunkin donuts coffee and grind it with the proline kitchenaid grinder and it is the best coffee i have ever had .   recently i had a kitchen remodel and the electrician showed up with his cup of coffee in hand from dunkin donuts .   i asked him later in the day if he wanted a cup of coffee and he was hesitant stating he did not like coffee from home coffee pots .   well ,  i assured him he would love it .  after having my coffee ,  for the rest of the week he never showed up with his own coffee ,  actually said ,  he preferred my coffee .   after the job was over ,  he saw my sister a few weeks later and he mentioned how he missed the coffee i made .   this is the best ever ,  perfect coffee every time and the perfect temperature .
i was suprized when i read the 1 review . i have had mine for 3 years and had no problems , it has been in the dishwasher , put away by my two kids . no cracks no chips , cleans up great
i only use the brisk brew for heating water while on vacation .  .  .  . i'm a tea drinker .   my ex husband got custody of the first one we bought ,  so the search was on .   when i couldn't find it in the stores i went on line .   as soon as i saw the exact same i ordered it .   it works great ,  and travels light !
yes ,  the le creuset spatulas are wonderful .  they look great and are very ,  very useful .  throw away your old rubber ones which melt and buy one of these .  you will never regret it
i am so in love with my new machine .   many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality .   i received my machine really quickly and that's saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification .   speaking of gratification ,  i could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine .   all the reviews are true .  it's perfect ,  once you read the instructions or perhaps do as i did ,  get a walk-thru from the wonderful folks at delonghi customer support ,  you will be up and running in no time .   you can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care  ( read the instructions )  will last a very long time .   the espressos i've made so far are supreme ,  even my 14 year old loved a weak one i made for him ;  and it's so easy after set-up to use .   it could not be any simpler .   who would not love this machine ?   there was one website that was charging $1200 for the same machine .   i could not believe my eyes .   the only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine .   i really could not see what he was talking about .   it has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam  ( it makes very creamy foam )  it will increase the volume 2-3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk .   but there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother .   they had me worried when i read that but the frother does its thing with total ease .   even a caveman could do it .   you stick it in the milk and turn the switch and ,  voila !  ,  it's frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and can't accomodate the foam it creates .   all in all ,  this is a top notch buy and a guilty pleasure for sure and nothing could be more gratifying then having merchandise that lives up to its promise .   this machine delivers ,  i love it and so will you
i love this coffee pot !   it makes a great pot of coffee ,  keeps it hot to that last cup ,  cleans like a champ and looks fabulous all at the same time !  !   i highly recommend this item .   a french press makes the best coffee and i'll never have to worry about breaking another glass carafe
i received this set as a wedding present and have loved using it over the past 4 months .  i cook several times a week ,  mostly for husband and myself ,  and sometimes for guests .  this set has been perfect for my needs ,  and has performed very well .  i follow the care directions  ( handwashing ,  no metal utensils )  and the non-stick coating has done very well .  i love the glass lids and the cushy handles .the set includes ,  as pictured ,  1- ,  2- ,  and 3-quart covered saucepans ,  6-quart covered stockpot ,  and 8- and 10-inch french skillets .  the skillets don't come with lids ,  but the two biggest pot lids work well .  note :  the product descriptions mention an 11-inch saute pan ;  this is not in my set  and is not included according to product features listing or the picture shown .  i did feel a need to buy a 12-inch skillet as the one addition to supplement this set .
used vet's rx to treat my dog's ear and it didnt seem to work .  after reading reviews i decided to try this  .  after only 1 week i noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better .  would recommend to others
this a a great pot .  .  . plenty big ,  and excellent quality .   my friend bought one too ,  as i liked it so much
great product .  i am using this because my kitchen is under remodelling .  works great with smaller vessels .  heats up evenly .  i give 4 points because i am annoyed by the bulb on the stove .  it is on as long as the burner is connected to power .  i would rather have a burner which has bulb to show if the burner is on/off .
i have used every major brand of cutlery and i can tell you there is no better value than analon knives .  i have been cooking and managing restuarants for over 30 years and i have found that the $100 knives are no better than thr $25 ones .  the analon product looks and feels just as nice as the most expnesive brands out there and is one third the price .  try them you will love them .  i might add that all knives have to be reground from time to time as the edge will become blunt and no sharpener will restore it .  when this happens find a local grinding service and have them restored .  a good knife can last you a lifetime if you take care of it happy chopping mik
i have enjoyed my new kitchenaid .   i'm thinking that i may have liked the smaller model that has the beater that tips up instead of having the bowl lifter ,  as it is awkward sometimes working around the beater .   overall ,  i am happy and can mix a lot in a short amount of time
this garlic press is very well made .  it's got some weight to it ,  but no too much .  works on the biggest cloves of garlic leaving only the skin behind .  well worth the money .  easy to clean
i love to spend my time in the kitchen ,  but what i don't like to spend is obscene amounts of money .  if i'm going to buy something i'd like to buy high quality so that i don't have to go buy it in a year or two .i kind of balked at the price - i found plenty of measuring spoon sets for a third of the cost of this stainless steel set .  but after receiving it and using it ,  i don't regret the extra money at all .this set has been more than faithful to me in the time i've had it - it's dependable ,  i can toss it into the dishwasher with no fears and the labels won't rub off .  i'm not afraid of abusing this set ;  it's stood up to my frantic mad dashes around the kitchen from the cookie dough to the spaghetti sauce .  if your old set has worn down to nothing and you're looking for something that will stay in your kitchen longer and more faithfully than you will -- this is the set for you .
the petstep ii multi-purpose dog sately ramp was perfect for getting my black lab ,  blake ,  out of the water and over our sea wall .   he is over 90 pounds and it was sturdy and supported his weight .   he is very appreciative and so am i !i would highly recommend this product and the seller selling it .
i pretty much agree with ilikeamazon's review below .   this blender looks nice ,  sounds quiet and doesn't dance all over the kitchen when being used .   the lid stays put and it's easy to clean .   it also matches all my other small kitchen aid appliances .   like others though ,  i make a smoothie every morning and i've had to learn how to use this blender for that .    first ,  it's helpful to let any frozen items sit for awhile in the blender  ( i load it as soon as i get water on for my coffee so it can sit until the last thing i do before leaving the house )  .if pushed for time ,  then i've found that putting the blender on pulse and constantly pulsing until the contents agitate on their own helps .   the problem is that either the funnel shaped bottom and/or the blades being turned in several directions pushes the frozen mush above the funnel shaped bottom of the blender .   air enters the funnel shaped bottom and the mush calmly just sits above the blades .   at this point ,  the blender can be stopped and the mush gently pushed back down into the funnel before restarting the blender .kitchen aid products  ( and their customer service )  are superior .   this blender is a nice addition to my kitchen .   as ilikeamazon said :    " there are always tradeoffs .  "   i do hope however that they improve on the smoothie making capabilities of this powerful ,  attractive blender .   then it will be a five star appliance .by the way :   i like amazon too !
these are extremely well-designed and will be the hit of your party !   i have used these twice at small gatherings and each person who had a martini commented about how great they were and asked where i bought them .   they are easy to clean and easy to store .   i highly recommend them .just be sure that your guests do not walk off with them ,  or even worse toss them in the trash when they are done with their drink .
i just received my jiffy steamer j-4000 pro-line .   it was missing a funnel which would be no big deal if they had not printed the words  " use enclosed funnel "  in caps every where .   i sent an email and they said they will send me one  ( they seem to have a good customer service )  .now that we have dispensed with the whining ,  lets talk about the product itself .   if you need sharp lines on your pants or shirt stick with your iron ,  this is not for you .   however if you would like to take wrinkles out of your clothes and you don't want to bother with hanging them in the bathroom while you take a shower or taking them out of the dryer on time ,  this does do an amazing job .i have also purchased a jiffy personal hand held steamer that works fairly well and provides adequate amount of steam for most of your needs .   however if you take wrinkles out frequently and have the space go for j-4000 .   you get the wrinkles out faster .if you have a concern about startup time ,  you do have some control over that .   i just put enough cold water in there for a few shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes .   if you put hot water out of the tab and reduce the amount of water you can get even quicker startup time .   or you can put it on standby in the morning before you go to the shower and put it on steam when you are ready to use it .   standby setting uses a thermostat to keeps the water temperature at 90c degrees  ( close to boiling )  .if you can afford it ,  buy one .   it would make a great re-gift item if you find out that you don't like it
ok ,  it's june and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds .  no need to feel depressed .  you can give this measuring cup set and hold your head up ,  knowing you gave something that won't be sneered at or find its way to the return pile by the blushing bride .everyone needs these cups to do cooking ,  from the large size for soup and broth to the small size for baking .  and i will confess ,  i've used the medium sized one as an emergency gravy boat .  so it doesn't look quite as nice as a cut glass gravy server--it works just fine .    i also use the glass cups for mixing batters to pour out right from the pitcher ,  and i use them for prepping foods like stir fry when you have to have a bunch of ingredients ready to hand to dump at once into the wok .
i bought the omega 8002 juicer on the recommendation of dr .  joseph mercola ,  a holistic health md who has a popular newsletter and website .  we met him at a health fair ,  tried vegetable juices  ( including wheatgrass juice )  and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet .  i mean ,  how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day ?  not so much .the omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 rpms ,  a powerful ,  slow auger that doesn't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam .  this protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation .  in addition ,  it is  " multifunctional " --the juicer can also be employed to make baby food ,  meat pate ,  nut butter ,  or fine ground coffee .  the machine is durable ,  said to be quiet ,  and has a 10-year guarantee .  sounds good ,  so we plunked down the cash and got the omega juicer and set to work .so ,  how is it to use the omega ?  well ,  it's easy to put together ,  though there are quite a few parts and choices to make .  essentially ,  the steps are :1 .  install the screw drive--the big green plastic spiral ,  into the plastic housing .2 .  pop a juicing cone  ( a type of sieve )  over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw .  this takes a bit of jockeying ,  but it drops in just fine .3 .  screw on the end cap and nozzle .4 .  mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor .5 .  add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing .6 .  put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing ;  one for the pulp ,  one for the juice .now it's ready to start juicing .1 .  cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1 . 5 inch diameter of the feed tube .  this means if you juice carrots ,  those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise .2 .  turn on the motor :  it has a forward direction to drive the food out ,  and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog .  i've never needed to do this .3 .  push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer .  the food feeds along the screw ,  is broken up ,  and the juice is forced through the sieve  ( cone .  )  out the nozzle comes the pulp .  the juice flows out underneath ,  nearer to the motor .4 .  when you are finished ,  turn off the motor ,  which is quite quiet--nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner .  more like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor ,  for comparison .  dismantle the machine and wash the parts .  a big bottle brush is included for this ,  very helpful .5 .  cleanup takes about 2-3 minutes and is mainly rinsing .  the worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it .  i do this asap ,  as i sip my juice ,  because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean .  i then reassemble it right then and there ,  and it's ready to go again .the omega juices kale ,  which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage .   we now can do wheatgrass ,  once we grow some or find a source of flats of it .just for grins ,  i tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding .  it makes a fine grind--not something you'd use for hamburger .  it would work for soft ,  somewhat grainy baby food or pate .  i did not try making pasta .how does it compare to spinning cup type models ,  like the braun which we previously used for juicing ?1 .  the spinning cup model  ( braun )  is loud ,  really loud .  this is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result .  this is typical for the cup-type juicer .  sounds like a blender .2 .  the cup model cannot juice wheatgrass--the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants .  it also can't do tough leafy vegetables such as kale .3 .  the cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the omega .  the pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry .  the pulp from the omega ,  by contrast ,  is like slightly moistened sawdust--definitely drier .in summary ,  the omega juicer ,  while pricier than the typical spinning cup models ,  is quiet and effective .  it gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can't handle ,  like wheatgrass and if you want ,  meat .  it extracts more juice--and at the prices for produce these days ,  especially if you buy organic produce ,  this is an important benefit .  the juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use .  if you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods ,  i would say ,  this is a model to strongly consider over others .  the performance and added functionality well repay the higher price
this is the best can opener i've ever used !  with arthritis in my hands and wrists i've always struggled with can openers .   ( the electric ones take up valuable counter space and tend to spill the liquid contents .  )  the oxo is easy to grip ,  easy to turn the knob and i appreciate the little jaw-grippy thingy on the side to help seperate the can and lid .
i have to admit that i was surprised when the rolling pin arrived .  i'm used to oxo quality ,  but this is over the top .  it is a big rolling pin ,  with an ideal diameter .  it is also heavy .  it's heft helps keep it where it belongs ,  instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder .  it has a strong axle ,  which glides remarkably smoothly ,  even when the pressure is on .  the hard non stick surface works very well ,  and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings .  the handles are simply the best i have have encountered .  this is a very well designed kitchen tool that fully lives up to the &quot ; good grips&quot ;  promise of quality
great price for beautiful ,  high-quality sheets that get softer with every wash .  fabulous color !  sheets fit well over a mattress with pillow-top .  recommend 100% .
the attachments that are available for kitchenaid mixers are worth their weight in gold .  this is the most recent attachment i've purchased for my mixer .  i can't tell you how much time was saved when making apple butter and apple relish for the holiday season .  this time of year ,  saving time is a good thing when there doesn't seem to be enough time for everything on your lists !  !  !  happy holidays
i am an avid baker .  sometimes you need to whip up your egg whites to fold in later .  having an extra bowl makes this so much easier than transferring to a different type bowl .  or maybe you are making christmas cookies - you can have one batter chilling in the fridge while you are mixing another one .  it's well worth the money
having gone through our share of toaster ovens in 22 years of marriage ,  this is by far the best .   it's classy looking on the counter ,  easy to clean ,  very lightweight ,  quiet and has alot of options for toasting and baking that make the food come out just as it should .    i can't imagine going back to a traditional toaster oven again .
when i bought this thing 3 years ago i thought i might do kabobs on it but not only does it cook kabobs beautifully it also cooks tandoori chicken and tandoori bread !i can't have an open flame grill where i live ,  and when i bought this i used it in the apartment .   now i take it on my patio to grill .   i like the see-through lid which most of these grills don't have .   it's too bad they've discontinued this produc
these pans are a great value  .  they are heavy duty and will last for a long time .  i do alot of baking and need to freguently replace them .  they  heat evenly to prevent burning .  the extra large size cuts my time in half so i can spend more time enjoying the end results with my family .  the silverstone coating makes clean-up a breeze .  they are alittle heavy so they are not the best if you want those little hands to help in the baking .  these pans are a must have for all
i love this pan .   as for cooking :  this pan does a great job on steaks ,  burgers ,  chicken ,  whatever .  leaves really nice grill marks .  the only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it .   i use a 16 "  round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range .   this seems to work just find for me .as for cleaning :   i let it cool a little after cooking and pour some water  ( no soap !  )  into the bottom of the pan while it is just hot enough for the water to boil a little ,  and using a wooden spatula  ( only use wood in this pan )  ,  i scrape all the fond away  ( burnt tasty bits stuck to the pan )  and pour into the sink .   i repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel .   i then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm .  takes about 2 minutes to do this .   i store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time .  this pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since i live in an apartment and don't have access to a grill
these are well-made spoons ,  not junky at all ,  which is always a possibility with cheap ,  mail-order items of this type .   the steel is heavy-gauge ,  and all the edges are rounded and safe .   good value and a good way to &quot ; top up&quot ;  an order
these towels are great !  i was surprised how large they are ,  but it's been a while since i bought towels ,  maybe all new towels are really big .   these towels are so absorbent ,  it's hard to tell when they've been used because the water just seems to disappear .   and soft ,  soft ,  soft .  .  . brand new out of the box they feel great .   again ,  they're big ,  so a litle heavy ,  but they are wonderful .   these are an amazing bargain and feel very luxurious .   i don't know what towels those other reviewers said resulted in fuzzies ,  they must have been referring to another product ,  these towels are awesome ,  no fuzzies ,  they are very well made
if you like knives that hold their edge ,  have good balance ,  and feel more expensive than they really are ,  this knife's a smart purchase .   we bought ours with the intent to get henckels .  my husband loves to cook and i have demanding standards for tools in my kitchen ,  especially knives .   anolon were half the price and every bit as good .as their reputation spreads ,  the prices seem to be going consistently up .
if you want to buy this color buy anchor bakeware it is so good
this pan works so great !  i have used it for cookies ,  biscuits ,  and pizza .  nothing has burned or stuck .  super easy to clean ,  you can wipe it off with a paper towel and stick it in the dishwasher or just rinse it with a sponge and soap and everything just slips right off .  great product !
i love this pan .  it's a 10 + in my eyes .   when it arrived i washed it with mild soap and water .   dried it ,  sprayed cooking spray and filled it with my cake batter and popped it in the preheated oven .   37 minutes later a gorgeous cake was baked .   i turned the pan over on a wire rack and my cake fell right out without one crumb stuck in the pan .   i'm going to give this pan as gifts in the future .this cake design is especially lovely when you dust the cake with powdered sugar and cinnamon .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
does what it is supposed to .   but go to yahoo foodsaver group for lots of hints on how to make it work as well as it can
i bought this scale back in jan or feb .  i needed one and after looking around for a while found that i liked this one the best because of its easy to read decimile display- pounds on one side ,  ounces  ( down to the tenth )  on the other side .  the lb/k switch is located on the bottom side of the unit and i don't find it inconvient down there .  this scale also has a auto shutoff feature that helps save your batteries but has never shut off while i'm in the middle of measuring .  because of previous complaints to that effect when i first got mine i timed how long it would stay on ending up with close to 2 . 5 min before it did .  i also love the look of the scale it is sleek and stylish ,  very clean lines and is easy to clean too ,  just a quick wipe down and i'm done .  as a note to alton brown fans this is his scale of choice on good eats .  the price tag may have you shying away but i assure you that its worth every penny .  i would not trade mine for anything !
i used the four large slider discs to move an 8' x 10' gambrel roofed framed shed a few feet on a cement pad  ( after building the mini-barn & painting it )  .   the move placed it against the fence .   it wasn't easy ,  but they did the job and .  .  .  .  .  . the slider discs are still useable though scratched up
in my opinion this is the best kitchen timer out there !it has four separate programmable digital timers that can count up and/or down - each with their own alarm sound .   it also has a regular clock setting .   plus ,  you can either plop it on the fume hood using the magnet on the back of it ,  clip it to your apron using the clip or set it on the counter using it's support stand .   oh ,  and did i mention how small it is ?  .  .  . just another nice feature !so yeah ,  no more having to set the oven timer ,  the microwave timer and my watch timer in order to keep track of all the various foods cooking at the same time .not only do i use this timer in the kitchen constantly i also use it for numerous other things too .   it's the  " time out "  timer for the kids ,  a ten-minute reminder when i need to get us all out of the house .  .  . you name it !my mother owns this same timer and is the one that originally introduced me to it ,  thank heavens !   i can't imagine running a kitchen without this hard to find item .   if you check out bed ,  bath & beyond you'll see they don't have anything with four programmable timers .long story short .  .  . if you purchase this timer i promise you will not be disappointed .
very lightweight - can use it on a magazine even - clipping it to the bottom of the magazine works well .   plenty of light to read by too - i sometimes don't need my reading glasses when using it
my fiance and i registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us .   i have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware .   this is exactly what the dr .  ordered !   here's why :1 )   heavy ,  sturdy construction .   these things can take a beating .   they heat evenly and hold heat very well .2 )   you can use metal utensils with them .   i hate plastic spatulas !   we all know that we aren't supposed to use metal with non-stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless ,  peeling shadow of its former self .   well this isn't the case with calphalon 1 !   scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear .3 )   they  " stick "  and sear as well as cast iron cookware  ( it's a good thing )  .   this is the best feature for me .   coated non-stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that's not non-stick such as stainless steel or cast iron .   they  " stick "  for a reason .   you need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning .   now there's the calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non-stick pan .   it's a no-brainer !4 )   they look cool ,  have great handles ,  they're oven-safe ,  and they come with a lifetime warranty .these are not cheap .   if your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don't buy this expensive set .   it will dissapoint you .   but ,  if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable ,  functional set ,  and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top-of-the-line product then this is for you .   serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware
to prevent scratches and chipping and to retain fiesta's smooth glossy surface ,  hand wash separately ,  one piece at a time ,  in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates  ( cups between coffee filters )  .   i do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new .  a friend gave me all her brown dripware  ( gourmet )  from 1969 and the place settings are scratched ,  pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing .   mine from the same era are still glossy ,  mostly scratch free ,  and certainly not pitted .  also ,  i don't put my original pieces in my microwave ,   ( only hers )  because although it may be safe to do so ,  this can dull a glossy finish .   re fiestaware ,  i remember seeing relatives and neighbors fiesta cups & plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and  " cheap " - looking ,  perhaps because of the dull rose ,  gray ,  and avacado colors at the time .  however , i find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and , so far ,  have bought heather , seamist ,  scarlett ,  tangerine ,  turquoise ,  and yellow .  cobalt ,  cinnebar ,  and plum are just too dark and dreary for me .   in the store ,  they are much darker than they look on here .  in a library book on fiestaware ,  they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color  ( like the fruit )  would be bright/pretty ,  too .
i like these lid covers as they fit very well .   i have always had a hard time with plastic wrap sticking ,  or aluminum foil tearing .   i would recommend this if you need to store your recipes for a bit before serving them .   i also like the sturdiness of these lids as it does not allow flavors to mix when you put them in the refrigerator
we have been extremely pleased with our tri-ply set  ( we have the 8-pc .  set plus a number of extra pieces we've picked up )  .   they heat evenly ;  are durable ;  the  ( long )  handles really do stay cool ;  and clean well .our only complaint is that calphalon doesn't seem to care about minimizing the number of lids necessary for their cookware .   we own only one lid that fits more than one pot/pan  ( the one for the 10 in .  pan ,  3 qt .  saute ,  6 qt .  stockpot ) --and we have 4 other lids which fit only a single pot ,  some of which are within 1/2 in .  of being the same width !however ,  we'd still get these pans again in a second ,  and probably go for the 13-piece set instead of the 8 piece as well
the skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time .  the quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet .  its much better then using teflon .  .  .   ( did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds ,  especially parrots )  well i never liked cooking in teflon and i have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me .  i am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection .  its important to realize ,  looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven .  .  .  those same skillets are still in use today .  .  try so to the same about your teflon or stainless steel pan from china .  just a good american made cast iron skillet and its very affordable to !  !  !
the solid contruction and well machined lids make these a joy to use .   we didn't want high maint .  type of cookware just a high quality ,  easy to use and maintain product that looks good on the pot racks but cooks well every day .   boy we are impressed !  these cook with even heat and the only negative found was that the lids fit so well you have remember to take them off befor the dish cools or a vacume can form inside requiring reheat to remove the lid .  they are easy to clean and a dream to handle
you can depend upon pyrex to give you a great product .  use this cup for measuring all the time
i really like this set .   the blue is very pretty and the tools are all very high quality
the zyliss ice cream scoop cuts through the hardest ice cream ,  which means i no longer have to wait for hubby to get home to have a scoop !
when all you're having is a big bowl of chunky soup for lunch or oatmeal for breakfast ,  this bowl goes great in the microwave and on to the sofa with you .so many times one has to be careful microwaving a hearty portion of soup or oatmeal in a regular-sized bowl ,  because it will boil over .   how much fun is that to clean up your microwave carousel before you can eat ?but this bowl is big enough to handle the bubbling .   just take a kitchen towel under it against the heat and you will be cozy in your terrycloth robe on the couch for some nice potato-ing
i searched for years trying to find a nice ,  plain white butter dish .  this one is perfect -- it blends in well with all my other dishes .  it is study ,  attractive ,  and holds a stick of butter .  what more could you ask of a butter dish
item exactly as promised .  was a gift for dad's new wife .  she was very happy with it
the pitcher does what it's supposed to do and is easy to clean .   my only wish is that they would make a pitcher like this microwavable and with lines showing the ounces of the contents .   that way you could pour the amount you need and pre-warm the milk in the pitcher prior to frothing ,  achieving better & faster & more convenient results
the cuisinart griddler has proved to be a very handy appliance in my kitchen .  it's various heat settings which are accurate is very helpful in perfect results for various tasks .   we have become addicted to panini !   they come out perfectly .   steaks are done to perfection !  i have not used the griddle as much ,  but when i have the results are great .
i received these as a christmas gift and am very pleased with them .   they are very thin so it makes gripping things out of the oven a lot easier than with thick mitts - and they'll take up less room in your drawer .   highly recommend - worth the extra money
great blender !  i use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails .  powerful motor purees frozen fruits great !  !  simple--only two speeds .  easy clean-up
this product has been great .   the price is about half similar sized crates you can find at a pet store .   the only difference is the metal is a little thinner but if your dog is not aggressive ,  it should be fine .   also ,  their is only one side door ,  doesn't have the 2 door options that higher priced crates have ,  but that didn't matter in our case .   this door was actually larger and our puppy found it easier to go in and out .   for the price ,  it's a great product
what i like :  quantity of beans you can grind before dumping the container ,  ease of operationwhat i don't like :  sort of messy ,  but this just comes with the whole process of grinding ,  regardless of brand ,  hole that ground beans comes out needs cleaning every timeoverall this grinder has been a good buy and i have enjoyed it so much more than my old blade grinder .
enough said .don't put a frozen jar on the base and you won't have to replace the blade assembly .   i am sure the owners manual says that someplace .my kitchen aid became unusable because replacement blades were not available 16 months after i purchased it .   aren't you glad you could purchase the replacement part ?my story :   my son put his leftover smoothie into the freezer ,  jar and all .   the next day when he took the jar out of the freezer and put it on the kitchen aid blender ,  the motor broke the blade assembly .   the motor base was still good and i liked the blender .   kitchen aid changed their model and didn't make replacement parts .   i think it is unreasonable for a manufacturer to not have replacement parts available after just 16 months .    (  .  .  .  )  !i can't say enough good things about the quality and ease of use of my cuisinart blender .   the jar's shape helps the food move and mix better than a round jar .   the jar's size is larger than any i have found .   i pour from the corner of the jar if the mix is too thick to pour from the spout  ( which i concede is a little wide )  .   the weight keeps the blender in place .   the shipping weight is around 15 lbs is that too heavy ?   maybe you should skip the smoothies and switch to a muscle building drink .   most every quality blender has weight to it .   the plastic units are light and considered disposable .   keep buying those $30 disposable blenders if you want ,  however i'll keep my cuisinart !the three year warranty and cuisinart's backing keep us ,  the consumer ,  in parts when we do something stupid  ( like putting the frozen smoothie mix on the blender and breaking the blade assembly )  .    (  .  .  .  )  replacement blade assembly is cheaper than being forced to purchase a new blender  ( kitchen aid )  .buy the cuisinart a great value for a quality product .
i'm new to bakery decorating and the tips work great !   you can use them with pastry bags or even just regular plastic bags  ( if you cut open a corner for the tip )  .   it is easy to clean with the brush and it is great that it comes with it's own box for easy storage .   there are enough tips for simple decorating ,  still testing out all the different sizes and options
the most important quality of this tea pot is that it pours well ;  it does not drip nor does the water overflow the spout when filling the pot .  i am very happy with my purchase
braun makes the best coffee makers and this feature makes it even better .   the coffee tastes more smooth because of this filter .   i love it
i was a kitchenaid fan .   i had the special edition 350 watt and burned the motor out twice in just a couple of years .   when it burned out the 2nd time i decided not to spend another $100+ on repairs .   i bought this delonghi and love it .the splash guard is great and convenient to use  ( i'd never used the kitchenaid splash guard because it was too much trouble )  .   now i don't know how i ever lived without one--no more white dust all over my counters .the power is more than i'll ever need but at least i don't have to worry about burning the motor out .it is very easy to change attachments .   you can even change them while the splash guard is on .it is also very easy to clean .great buy
product lived up to its listed features .   the person who received it as a gift was thrilled with it .   thank you
i am surprised to see so many negative reviews .   we've had ours for five or six years ,  use it at least daily ,  and have been quite satisified with its performance .   it generally toasts the bread evenly ,  and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next .   it doesn't seem that slow to me ,  but my expectations may differ from yours .   i agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing ,  but we just leave it on the four-slice setting .   i also agree it is a bit pricey ,  but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently .   perhaps cuisinart has a quality control problem ,  but we wouldn't hesitate to buy another one .   good luck
i like the amazon customer service as they replaced my order when i got the damaged one
i bought one of these muffin pans because i was excited at the prospect of owning a piece of bakeware whose lining wasn't destroyed by the 3rd time i wanted to use it .  for that alone ,  i would give this item 5 stars .i am not an experienced baker ,  but i think that after reading the other review for this item that more balanced comments need to be stated regarding the actual use of this muffin pan .so here are my comments :1 .  you need to use a cookie sheet  ( or something similar )  to support the pan since it is flexible .2 .  the muffins cook faster than with a metal pan .3 .  the muffins seem small if you fill the cups as you would with a metal muffin pan - you can actually fill them up all the way .   ( recall that i am not an experienced baker ;  as an engineer i suspect that since the muffins cook differently ,  i . e .  faster ,  this could be compensated by adjusting the batter in some manner .  as far i'm concerned as long as the muffins taste good ,  it doesn't matter to me .  )4 .  the coating is not exactly non-stick .  you do not need to grease the pan ,  but you do need to be careful when it comes time to remove the muffins .  i use the dull side of table knife to separate the muffin sides from the pan  ( while gently pulling the pan )  .  after doing that i put a plate on top of the muffin pan and  hold it against the pan as i invert the pan .  all i have to do then is tap the bottoms of the muffin cups to get them out .  by my third time doing this i was able to get them all out intact and unscathed .i am very happy with my muffin pan - it might take a little bit of getting used to for someone used to other pans - but for me ,  the benefit of not having a cheap non-stick coating peeling off of the metal after a year more than compensates for a slight learning curve on the use
we had been enjoying the whole experience of the keurig b50 ,  when i got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that keurig was promoting a new and improved single-cup brewer .  i confess - i coveted this new machine in a big way .  so when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new b70 last week on our front stoop ,  it was very much like christmas for me .  my wife just smiled ,  and the kids gave out a sincere ,   " whoa ,  that's cool !  "  at our new kitchen friend .everything that we liked about the b50 is there for the b70 - with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel .  the coffee just tastes good ,  first and foremost .  i've tasted cups from other single-serve brewers ,  and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop-the-cup coffee .  from my first experience with the keurig machines ,  however ,  i was amazed how good the brew tasted .  the home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot ,  or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine's brew basket got finicky .  the additional my k-cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans ,  too - so as a coffee snob ,  i'm hooked .the platinum b70 adds selection for cup size - right now ,  i think our best default size is 9 . 25oz ,  filling out most travel mugs and our normal in-house mugs well without getting watery on the k-cups we've tried so far .  and it has a larger reservoir for water ,  meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink .  all of these things would be enough ,  right ?but wow ,  it is just so cool looking .  the blue led lights that make the water glow on the left ,  and the blue lcd screen on the right that shows the clock ,  menu ,  cup selection ,  and the chrome fixtures - even the spring-loaded holder in the front top of the brewer - all of that combines to make it more than just a good coffee ,  taking us into the realm of a really cool experience .  the kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen ,  seeing daddy's glowing blue coffee brewer ,  just wanting to marvel in its glow .  .  .  .  okay ,  that's a little too melodramatic ,  but only slightly .if you like coffee and spend more than $10 per day ,  or throw away more than a third of a pot of coffee each morning ,  or if you enjoy coffee but avoid making it at night because for just one cup that whole pot will go to waste - i think you owe it to yourself to try this brewer out .  not just in the store ,  but blue and glowing in your own kitchen .  trust me -  " merry christmas "  is a great feeling
this bakeware is absolutley the best i have ever had .   it doesn't stick ,  rust ,  or burn .   super easy to keep clean ,  just toss in the dishwasher .   i you are a baker you must have this ,  you will be amazed
my husband ,   ( a jaguar lover )  ,  calls this the  " e-type of toasters "  !   it is beautifully designed ;  requires minimal space and is 'simply' sophisticated .   to achieve the  " perfect toast "  using our old toaster required toasting a slice of bread three times ,  turning it twice ,  - now it's one single click .kitchen appliances wouldn't be hidden away inside the cabinet if they were designed as elegantly as braun's impressions toaster
this color of fiesta is just gorgeous and a great addition to any collection .  my sister-in-law ,  for whom this was a gift ,  just loves it and i'd be tempted to buy a set for myself if i didn't already have a ton of dishes .  the fiesta line are all well made ,  solid dishes that can be used for all occasions .   if you know someone needing dishes ,  the fiesta line is the way to go .  these dishes increase in value regularly and add a lovely touch of color to your table
i do a lot of stir frying ,  using one pan to do many dishes .   as a result i needed a pan that had non-stick quality for quick and easy cleaning and one that could take high heat from my professional stovetop .   when pan and oil are heated to the right temperature the interior 18/10 stainless steel surface behaved as if it were nonstick .   the heat was evenly conducted bottom through the sides ,  this due to the aluminium core sandwich being continuous from the bottom up the sides .   the sides are high enough to not have food spill out in the process of vigourous stir frying .  the height is also good for small item deep frying .   the steep sloping of the sides enabled food to rotate well ,  falling back easily into the pan .   quality pans tend to be heavy ,   all clad without exception but this size is perfectly manageable for tossing ingredients if need to .   it also cooks a generous portion for one to two persons .   all types ( including metal )  of utensils can be used with it .   this is a solid ,  handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and use .   it is a total joy to cook with and one that gives you confidence that it will last a long ,  long time
these glasses do work and in much more distinct way that i could have ever imagined .  i have bought many riedel glasses to my wine-lover friends and they absolutely love it too .  you got to try them to believe it .  you won't regret it
i love having these pyrex cups in varying sizes .   the large ones are great for mixing and pouring batter ,  like pancakes .   the smaller one let's you measure once ,  to get 1 1/2 or 2 cups of liquid
i am happy with the product quality and with the prompt delivery .the organizer is made of sturdy materials and comes on a very nice chrome hanger
the first time i used it i put a little white vinegar into the water with the eggs and timer .  it seemed to cut down on the plastic smell .  also the vinegar will seal your eggs if they crack preventing the insides from leaking out .  i did notice the timer has to be completely dark for the eggs to be done instead of the little light circle in the middle like is stated on the packag
this product is extremely quiet .   my cat loves it and its great because it encourages her to drink more
i've owned electric skillets before and it was always so difficult to clean up that we put them away and only pulled them out for big occasions .   we bought this skillet a month ago and use it several times a week .   we haven't had any problems with it at all ,  and we love the way you can pull the pan off for easy clean up
we have had this dinnerware for several years .  it really is beautiful .  however ,  it chips quite easily  ( or maybe we are just a bit rough with 4 kids !  )  and so i find i have to buy some new ones each year so i have enough unchipped plates when company comes
we have a new puppy and i bought this cleaner .   when i read the negative reviews i almost returned it unopened .   for some reason i decided to try it .   i had just rented an industrial sized rug doctor about three weeks ago to do my carpets .   i just wanted to try this to see how it would do .   the dirt and dog hair i got out was amazing .   it was very easy to put together and to use .   i recently had shoulder surgery and this was very easy to operate with one arm !   thank you so much
we were more than pleased with our purchase of this item ,  and it arrived sooner than expected .it was very very nice and well worth the great discounted price we received it for .
this is a pretty good timer with two timing capability ,  but the only complaint i have with it is that you have to push a minimum of four different buttons just to stop the timer and get it to stop the led screen from flashing .   however ,  it has very nifty features and the sound of the timer is not too irritating .   also ,  the five minute warning is very useful
this is a really nice cookie sheet .  i baked cookies soon after i received this cookie sheet ,  and they were great !  i plan to order another so that i have 2 on hand .  i am tired of the nonstick pans that scratch and then rust easily .  this is a nice alternative
ive had only great hot drinks from my machine !  !  i love it
i had traditionally used pyrex cake pans and wasn't completely satisfied with the results .  just recently ,  i purchased the airbake cake pan after having successful results in their line of cookie sheets .  i am completely satisfied with this pan and recommend getting rid of the traditional pyrex
this machine is really a great invention - especially for those of us who have a tendency to spend on good tea and then screw up some part of the process that falls between the brewing and the first sip  ( for example ,  infusing the tea for too long )  .   i think my tea will have more of a fighting chance with this new machine .   the design is great - quite classy ,  and i think it will be great for entertaining  ( loved the way the tray that holds the machine could suddenly be converted into a serving tray for the well-designed tea pot and cups )  .   here is how it worked for me :you pour your loose tea in the infuser basket ,  fill the tank with water ,  select the strength of your beverage and turn it on .   there's even a chance to choose which kind of tea you are brewing for optimal results  ( for example oolong or green )  .   this nifty little machine will do the rest .   it will even pour the tea in the tea pot !   i'm finally enjoying my fine tea without the stress .   it's almost like having a tea butler in my house !
this roasting pan is a prize and well worth the investment .  it is heavy duty and i have used it for large rib roasts and a turkey .   it is wonderful for making gravy on my gas stove after roasting ;  the rack is so sturdy it holds any roast i could fit in my oven .   it washes clean with little effort so i have not had to use the dishwasher .   it looks like new after washing .   this pan will be around a lot longer than i will !
cthis is my second bread maker .  i bought cuisinart's one last year and had used it for about a year .  i had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point .cuisinart's one has obviously some problems :1 .  bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard .2 .  it is very noisy during kneading cycle as i can not hear the music from the audio .3 .  paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts .4 .  some basic cycle have no  " pre-heat "  cycle .  it means i need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely .  but it is very hard and sometimes i fail .5 .  the design of the case is not great .  some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if i do not mix it using a spatula .one of my friends owns panasonic bread maker and showed it to me .  i was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different .  she has never had such a problem which i have had .  then i decided to get panasonic one although my first one is still working .  the bread maker was delivered in 2 days .  i tried same recipe which i often used for cuisinart's .  the bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from cuisinart .  bread is nicely blown ,  crispy outside and soft ,  fluffy inside .  it is just perfect .  i guess these difference come from mainly these things :1 .  the case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful .2 .   " pre heat "  cycle adjust the temperature of water well .  i do not have to make appropriate temperature's water any more .3 .  this machine has the special room for yeast .  it works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer .i think i never back to cuisinart although i miss some points  ( sophisticated design or the window on the rid which i can see inside of the case through )  of cuisinart a little bit .  i highly recommend this bread maker .
this is a jewel .  takes the skin off nice and clean .  just the tool to get rid of those tough skins on a few tomatoes and no more fuzzy peaches .  just bought 6 more for family and friends .
this thermometer has been a great asset to me during the course of my employment at the bellagio in las vegas ,  as well as during my time as a student at le cordon bleu .  easy to use ,  full-featured and very dependable ,  i  have recommended this thermometer to many people and use it many times each day
i feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the  " misguided "  reviewer who likened it to a jack-hammer .   that review gave me pause when i was considering ordering it .   fortunately i had faith in amazon's return policy and decided to give it a chance .   it's not at all too heavy or too large .   i'm 5' 3 "  with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly .   it really is ergonomically designed .   the power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it .   you have no need to change your grip until you're through blending--which is next to no time .   it blends thoroughly and efficiently .   it does have enough weight to give you some control .   you wouldn't want something this powerful to be too light--it could just fly out of your grasp .   this feels solid ,  is very attractive ,  and also appears to be very well made .   i love it .  if you think you might want an immersion blender  ( and if you cook ,  you do )  you'll love it too .it should be noted that this is also called an immersion blender .  i was confused by the two designations--hand blender/immersion blender .   apparently they are the same thing although listed separately
i have ,  and do use ,  many different fillet knives but needed one for knife block in the kitchen .  it had to match my other 4 stars .  it not only matched but the construction if great and is an excellent performer
i have used this filter with my grind-n-brew for 2 years .  i put it in the dishwasher at least twice and have never had any problems with it .  i have no idea what these other reviewers are doing wrong ,  but i love this filter .  i never have grounds in my coffee .  there is always a little darker/thicker coffee in the bottom of a good cup of coffee !as for price ,  $20 is not the actual price for this filter .  $10 is the  " real "  price ,  so you are not getting a deal on amazon especially when you add shipping  ( unless you are getting free shipping )  .  i have seen the same $10 filter at wal-mart ,  walgreens ,  ace hardware ,  and publix .overall ,  if you enjoy a good cup of coffee and do not want to put the chemicals added to paper filters in your body ,  buy this coffee filter
i am very pleased with the dishes .   years ago i owned corelle dishes ,  and am now wondering why i went the way of the heavier dishes .   they don't scratch or take up a lot of space .   i bought two sets .   i love love the colors and my table settings are so nice to look at ,  especially since i purchased table mats with big orange blooms to put the dishes on and celery napkins to match .  it really makes for a beautiful table .  i get compliments all the time .   i was also very pleased with how quickly i received the dishes  - in about 3 days .   i am always happy with my purchases made through amzon . com
calling it short is a misnomer - it's not that short - it's an average size .  it has a rather bulky handle that is comfortable to hold but difficult to store .  the turner itself is a little on the thick side so lighter foods don't always want to cooperate but i'm pleased with it .  i wouldn't buy a matching spoon becuase of the bulky handle - takes up too much room in my drawer
this is my second dlc-10 .   the only reason for replacement is because the bowl cracked and it became cost effective to just make a machine rerplacement .   i have all the disks and such and like the machine very much as i have had it for 20 years
i purchased this product for two reasons :  i own other cuisinart cookware and like it very much .  .  . secondly ,  i frequently make spaghetti sauce with meatballs and find that a 3-quart saucepan just isn't large enough .  the 4-quart size is perfect .  for some reason i can't explain ,  my sauce tastes much better made in this saucepan
bye whisking you away i froth ,  foam and easily handle all your whisking problems away .  my handle is so secure it will absoutley amaze you with  its workability .  please try me so i can whisk you into my recipes ,  now
this little fan does just what i need it for .  a bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk .  it clips on very well .  i even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on .  i would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation .  that oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful .  my reason for no 5 stars is the vibration .  there is too much especially on high speed .  this could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip .  it doesn't bother me but might others .  the cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch .  i needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan .  this was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt .all in all very good for my uses .  if you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you
the black plastic looks a little odd .   it's not glossy like the picture .   it doesn't look really clean even after you clean it is the only way i can discribe it .   i bought 2 of these for the office to replace our old ones because we burnt a pop tart and the rest of the building was less that thrilled that the fire department had to respond .  this one is suppose to shut down if something gets stuck in it .   good idea .   but ,  the instructions still say not to cook pop tarts unattended anyway .   now they tell us .   there is a toaster with a pop tart logo ,  the toastmaster 2035 .   if you want a laugh ,  read the review for that one .   bottom line ,  for the money ,  this toaster works great .   i like the lift feature a lot .   but ,  i'd buy the white next time
purchased the toaster as a gift for my daughter's family .  they love it .  with 2 kids and friends ,  the large capacity ,  sleek design ,  and perfect toasted bagels ,  keeps everyone happy .  get lots of positive comments from friends on how it looks and toasts !
i have a number of booklites ,  different vendors ,  different styles ,  some ac adapter ,  some straight battery ,  cheap to higher prices ,  and this one is the best ,  the brightest ,  the one i will most often use .   it is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times .   i am careful with such items ,  don't expect any problems ,  most booklites are not meant to be manhandled
this kettle is very stylish with modern detailing .   the removable whistle and stay-cool handle are added pluses .   its smooth lines make it very easy to clean ,  and its contemporary shape makes it especially attractive
had i known what a difference this would make with my cooking ,  i would have bought one a long time ago .  everything is faster ,  now ,  and everything i mix ,  from potatoes to icing ,  comes out smoother ,  too .there are a variety of things you can make with this mixer ,  and i use mine a lot .  perhaps not every single day ,  but almost .  i bake bread with it every few days ,  and i decorate cakes for parties and special occasions on the side .  my mixer has never let me down .  in fact ,  i am buying an extra bowl just for convenience ,  too .sometimes you do get a strange smell when you use it to whip something up .  they even tell you in your mixer's manual to expect it and that it is normal .i've had mine for almost a year ,  now ,  and was waiting until i had it awhile before i reviewed it .  but i have yet to have any problems with it .it's cut preparation time more than half for everything i've made with it .  from cakes to meatloaf and bread .  it's sturdy and somewhat heavy ,  which means it's not going to easily be knocked off your counter .it does have a slow start to prevent flour from going all over .  however ,  if you are using a lot of powdered sugar or flour to the point of it being more than half full ,  you will still want to use the stir speed until it's a little more settled and moist or you will end up with a mess .  not a big one ,  but a mess nonetheless .it comes with a book of recipes ,  but i've only used a few .  i've never had any issues with it handling all the cookie dough and other heavy doughs i've mixed with it ,  however .  in fact ,  i've made more cookies just since getting this than i did for years before .  it's just so convenient and easy that i don't mind .  i mean heavy doughs ,  too ,  like monster cookies and peanut butter m&m cookies ,  etc .i don't know what else to say about it .  i don't think you will be disappointed in this purchase .  i'm usually someone who doesn't like to spend a lot of money ,  but this was more than worth it ,  and i will be buying my daughter one someday ,  too
we are very happy with the knives we've purchased .   they are really sharp and do well in the dishwasher
i love all my calphalon pots ,  pans ,  and bakeware .   best set i have every owned or used .   even heat ,  easy clean up ,  i have never made reductions as easily as i have in these pots & pans .the fact that you can get these on special with great pricing puts it over the top .   i paid $26 . 57 for this after discounts and free shipping
i love having the edge measurements as well as the circular measurments .   i wish i had a cabinet big enough for this wonder tool ,  but like some of my favorite baking sheets ,  this will have to live on top of the counter .   after use ,  it cleans up very nicely ,  and a coat of mineral oil makes it look like a million dollars .   i'm very satisfied
i could definitely tell a difference in the taste of my water ,  and hopefully that means it's chlorine free ,  but i haven't had it tested .  however ,  it must be doing its job because the filter itself only lasts about a month !  i think that its life span just depends on how bad your water is .  it works better that my old brita filter ,  which i could tell wasn't working because my water still smelled like chlorine with that one .  that being said ,  i would buy the pur pitcher over again if given the choice
i got these as part of our wedding registry here on amazon and with about 2 months of use i am very happy with this set .   more so than any other set of pots/pans that i own .here are some pro's :1 - the non-stick is truly non-stick and so easy to use .   the fact that the outside is non-stick also makes cleaning up easy .2 - the handle really does stay cool ,  even near the edge on gas burners3 - the size of all 9 pieces are very convenient4 - easy to wash due to non-stick and dishwasher safe5 - thermospots assists in cooking evenly6 - oven safegreat price and value
i've had this knife for years ,  use it for everything and couldn't be happier .   i thought it would dull easily or wear down ,  after all it's only $10 ,  but i was wrong .   simply fantastic for cutting bread ,  but also useful for vegetables and other tasks .   the only thing it doesn't cut well is meat
this scale has worked perfectly for me for the last year or so .   it is very easy to use .   it looks great and has a permanent place on our counter .   i wish all consumer electronic products were designed and built to the same standards as this scale
if you want the retro look and a super toaster .  .  .  .  . this is the one for you .  toasts perfectly and looks great !  i've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever
this spatula makes frosting simple to complex cakes very easy .   works well with many different icings
the only complaint from the other reviews that i can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control .   i certainly don't have any trouble getting hot milk .   my taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated ,  but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as i've had in america .i've had my espressopro for 3 years and it's still working well .   when i first bought the machine ,  it didn't work ,  and the capresso people were wonderful and immediately sent a new machine .   then there was a mixup over the color  ( silver vs chrome )  ,  and again the capresso people were wonderful and sent a new machine .   both times they sent me a machine immediately ,  with packaging to send my old machine back ,  so i had a new machine within two days of calling them .i always use espressione coffee pods ,  and filtered water .   that's just what is most convenient for me .   i've never actually cleaned the machine's innards ,  and i haven't noticed any degradation in performance over the years .the milk attachment is very convenient .   we wash ours about once a week ,  although we do have to wash the little siphon/nozzle thing every day .   it's about as much work as a stainless jug i guess ,  with the advantage that you're not wasting milk every time you make a latte .the downside to the milk attachment is that i haven't found a way to get a lot of froth out of it .   it's got a little knob on top that is supposed to control the amount of froth .   it does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk ,  but no matter what i do ,  i almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte .   occasionally i end up with a lot more or almost none ,  but i have no idea why .   that's my biggest complaint .the bit where the coffee comes out into your cup  ( you can see my level of sophistication there )  has two holes ,  so it can pour into two cups at once .   this is worthless .   the coffee never comes out evenly ,  and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway .   the end result of the two holes is that whenever i make an espresso ,  some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in .   it's also a bit short for any latte glass i've ever found ,  and you have to tilt the glass to get it under .despite the fact that the espressopro doesn't look particularly tough  ( it's mostly plastic ,  and not really heavy plastic at that )  ,  mine is still going strong after three years .   much to the dismay of my grandparents ,  three years is considered long enough to classify something as  " durable "  thesedays .so there you go .   i'm sure there are machines that make better espresso ,  but for convenience ,  i haven't seen any machines that can touch this one for less than twice the price .   there are a couple of things i'd like to change  ( milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser )  ,  but i would still recommend it
a well made no frills percolator .   it packs well , is quite simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee .   the ideal coffee pot for camping or outdoor use .   a superior product compared to the many flimsy coffee pots made for campers
i got rid of my electric can opener when i bought this one .   there is no need for it anymore .   this can opener works like a charm and very easy to use .   does not take up any space at all .love it !  !  !  !  !  !  !
great product for a good price .   all sent as ordered
cuisinart dco-24 die cast is the best can opener .  i've owned mine for a year ,  and love it !  if i could give it 10 stars i would .
i didn't have a bundt pan ,  and i found this one when i went in search of one .   i'm so glad !  !  !   i've only had it a week ,  but have used it 4 times !  !   has a very unique shape
i purchased this knife because my daughter didn't like using any of my knives ;  she wanted one like the chefs all use on food network .   i wasn't willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise ,  and i'm pleased with it .   it's nice-looking ,  feels comfortable to hold ,  works well for chopping vegetables .  overall ,  a decent knife at a very reasonable price .
love the pan ,  the center is so cool ,  because you can tell when the product is pre-heated .  .  .  .  . the center changes and it is so great .   the pan is almost too big ,  but it is perfect for everything i can possibly cook in it
i've had my keurig for about two months now and absolutely love it .   it makes wonderful tasting coffee in 30 seconds or so .   it was well worth the extra money
works very well .   only drawback it's large - but stands upright .well worth the money and quit in the low speed .
this item was ordered to replace a kitchen aid unit used extensively for a number of years .   i am a heavy gourmet baker and cater to very discriminating clients .   i first heard of the delonghi mixer when it was branded kenwood -in an australian magazine .what a nice difference !   the kitchen aid now appears to be so antiquated by comparison !  !i love the very practical easy to clean design and construction of the delonghi as well as the physical ability of the unit to mix more content in a more complete manner .i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product .
i wish i would have bought one a long time ago .  it is so convenient .  easy to clean up .  very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking .  seems powerful enough for everything i have tried it on .  you still need to pull out the big food processor for larger amounts because this only holds 1 cup or so .  that would be the only negative .  otherwise i love it .great product for the price .  $14 well spent !  !
my mother is korean and so i grew up using stainless steel chopsticks .   apparently they're quite popular in korean households .  .  . as well as stainless steel rice bowls .   you might have seen them ,  the ones with the stainless lids ?anyway .   these are just like the ones i grew up using .   there are some drawbacks  ( like the noodle comment made earlier )  but it's not a product flaw .   yes ,  wooden chopsticks are going to grip better ,  but they also tend to mildew if used repeatedly and have to be restocked .   lacquer coated wooden chopsticks tend to flake after a while .   and besides ,  when eating asian food you don't really pick up individual noodles  ( which would have you slipping and sliding )  .   you sorta grab a large portion and bring your face close to the bowl and slurp them down .   i think the japanese actually bring the bowl to their face instead .   trust me .  .  . it all goes where it needs to .the main thing is getting use to their diameter .   these are much more slender than the wooden chopsticks you see in restaurants .   not for the novice chopsticker
i've used this knife for nearly two years and i love it !   it fits perfectly in my hand and takes a razor sharp edge with little effort .   this knife sold me on the entire four star line
this iron is a technological marvel .   i have just had it for a few days and i have ironed some very difficult ,  over 100 year ,  heirloom open-embroidered linen .   it was a breeze and the results were truly professional .   the controlls are easy to use ,  the steam settings excellent .   it just glides over those diffucult spots .   it may be a little pricey ,  but it is worth every penny .this is an ideal tool for anyone who sews on home fabrics .   the upright steam feature is a plus .    i was concerned about the weight ,  but the iron glides so effortlesly that you do not notice the weight .
this kettle is amazing .   it's simple -- you plug it in and flip the switch  ( a light turns on to let you know it's working )  .it heats very quickly ,  &lt ; 5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea ,  it heats in about 3 .for students in dorms ,  you can use it for oatmeal ,  soup ,  tea .   automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute ,  so no worries about fire hazards .   great product ,  i use it every day .
this is a great iron .   it's quite heavy ,  but i like that .   it really gets out the wrinkles .   i don't even mind ironing any more
this is the best blender i have ever used .  it grinds indian style batter real good .  it grabs and churns the mixture quickly .  i am using it for the past 5 months ,  and there has been no problems with it .  the jar is plastic and easy to handle and clean .
this corelle set has that handcrafted italian detailed look but without worrying about everyday wear-and-tear .  it's time to retire my old butterfly pattern which i've had for decades .  i rate it four stars only because it would be so much more practical to sell these in sets of six .  it's more profitable for corelle but not so practical for us .  yes the bowls are shallow and the mugs are stoneware so they are not break resistant .
this toaster is definetly well worth the price .  it is sturdy ,  compact and full of features .  and the best of all !  it doesn't burn the toast !  very happy with it and the $10 . 00 less price than at macy's !
i bought 3 of these .  they are great .  easy to use ,  easy to clean and they work .  after buying one i ordered 2 more for gifts and both of those people who recieved them also loved them .
ok ,  for twenty bucks it works reasonably well .   we like the storage container to hold the attachments .   but if you're looking for a lower speed to blend ingredients like flour or pancake mix ,  buy something else .   the #1 speed setting is way too fast .   anything higher than #4 will decorate your kitchen walls  " at no extra charge "  .
le creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron chinese-styled wok .   it looks like a chinese wok ,  and it is made of iron ,  but essentially it is not chinese .the wok is much thicker than a chinese iron wok ,  and therefore takes much longer time to warm up .  some american users praised the wok by saying it does not need much fire ,  yet the essence of chinese stir-frying is cooking through large fire :  one heats a thin chinese carbon iron wok with large fire ,  puts in vegetable or animal oil ,  and then does the entire stir frying in less than a few minutes .still ,  i liked the wok after purchasing it .  the chinese food here in the us usually is not really chinese food in essence ,  but people like it .  why should i be so critial to a french cast iron wok which looks like a chinese wok ?
this is a great skillet for a party or a large family .   we used it on super bowl sunday for bbq wings .   the skillet kept them warm and looked good as a buffet server ,  as well .  it cleaned up quickly and easily .
i am quite enamoured with this little utensil .   i bought it because it was the cheapest silicone spatula i found ,  but it turned out also to be the best designed .   the all-silicone construction not only protects the handle from melting ,  and you pot from scratching ,  but makes it the easiest and most comfortable to use as well .also note that most silicone products are only rated for use up to 400f or so ,  while this is rated to 600f .   i havent used it at temperatures that high ,  but i'm comforted to know i have that option if the need arises
i really wanted a 5-quart pot and wouldn't want to spend a lot of $$$ .   this turned out to be a great buy .   it is a very good quality product .   the non-stick surface seems very well coated .   it's very versatile for us  ( a family of 4 )  .   i am very pleased and satisfied with the product
i use this for more than just tea ,  defrosting frozen veggies ,  making broth ,  a few drops on a sponge for cleaning ,  this thing is the greatest
when i decided to buy this oven ,  i was not even looking to buy a convection toaster oven .   i stumbled across this item looking for cookware .   i read all the reviews ,  thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it .   boy ,  am i glad that i did !  !  !   and so is my family .   the day we received it ,  i cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack .   extremely easy .   all i needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me .   since then ,  we have cooked more muffins ,  a meatloaf ,  bacon ,  toast ,  english muffins ,  chicken strips ,  waffles and bratwurst .   my kitchen doesn't heat up like when i use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven .   it was so easy for my husband to use this also while i was shopping and i just gave him a 15 second class before i left .   i didn't notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods .   this is my first convection toaster oven ,  which has replaced the microwave and toaster ,  and i can assure you we expect to use this oven alot .   i love the design ,  the warming tray does just that ,  even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm .   it's great !  the oven is big enough to cook meatloaf or chicken breasts and yet is not so monstrous that you lose your entire counter for one appliance .   i would recommend this to anyone .   what a great idea for the kitchen
the farberware millennium soft touch stainless-steel 12-inch nonstick skillet is great for almost any cooking .
i'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching .   my persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched .   i think next time i'll order them as individual place settings as they weren't packed well .   amazon will give me a 20% discount for keeping them .
at $20 and free shipping this is probably the best deal around for people on a buget .  realistly the retail value is not $80 it is around $40 .  the fabric is not all that soft however with a few washings it should be great .  if the thead count bothers you like some other reviewers spend more money don't complain about it when it's plainly listed .  an easy way to solve that problem if you are on a tight budget now is to buy it and then later buy a duvet to make the comforter softer .  the only reason i deducted a star is because the bed ruffle is very flimsy .  it feels like it would tear very easily .  this is not a problem for me as i find them annoying but may bother some people .  all in all i think it is a great deal
this set of blender accessories was just what i needed to update my old blender .   seperatly these items become more costly but here they are at a great value and shopping is made easy because this set has it all
i love this thing !   not only does it perform beautifully ,  but it's absolutely gorgeous .   i prefer to serve meals in it rather than one of my pretty platters .i waited a pretty long time  ( almost a year )  before writing my review to make sure i abused it enough .   this is my 2nd review .because it's well made ,  it's pretty heavy .  .  . that's why the  " helper handle "  is so helpful .we have a chicken salad about 4 times a week so i wanted a really big pan to be able to sear my chicken all at once without having to work in shifts .to clean and sanitize stuff ,  i put everything in the dishwasher .  .  . vacuum attachments ,  toothbrushes ,  dog and cat toys etc .  .  . so the fact that this fits in my dishwasher is awesome for me .   i wash it by hand about 1/2 the time .the nonstick coating is wonderful .  .  . not a scrape or scratch on it .   pay particular attention to cleaning the rivets  ( that might be the wrong terminology )  that attach the handle to the pan on the inside .   the dishwasher gets all the icky stuff out of every crevice ,  but i use a soft dish brush for the rivets if washing by hand .: -
this spatula has an easy hold grip ,  works like it's supposed to ,  and washes well in the dishwasher
this vacuum is rather good .  it meets or exceeds the dustbuster versions .  i've got only one gripe ,  and that's the base .  it isn't exactly easy to put on and take off .it could also do with a bigger compartment ,  but that's really minor .  after all ,  this is just for small tasks .love the motorized sweeper attachment
i was pretty hesitant to try a new baking item ,  but these muffin pans are wonderful !  the cleanup is super easy ,  there is no problem getting the baked item to slip out ,  and i don't have to worry about rust or tarnish .  i would highly recommend this type of new bakeware to anyone who loves to bake ,  but doesn't love to clean
solidly built with easy to read numbers .  looks like it will last a long time  although it was a little pricey .
based on the other reviews posted ,  i purchased this board and am extremely pleased with it .  it's nice and big for rolling out all kinds of doughs .   you may have to make room in your cabinet to store it if you don't want it on your counter all the time ,  but it is worth the trouble .   also it washes up nicely
i love these pans .  i got the set for a wedding gift last year but needed another saucepan ,  so this was perfect .  this one is a little larger than the 2 pans in the set .  i absolutely love the set - the pans heat up very quickly and clean up beautifully .  they're less expensive than many of the gourmet sets but just as good
the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised .  it has three nested work bowls .  the inner ,  smallest one takes a special blade  ( a smaller version of the standard processor blade )  .  it's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things .  pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something .  the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest ,  12 cup bowl .a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box  ( finally ,  a way to keep everything together )  .  the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl .  it's the kind with the rotating hub  ( two hub sizes are included ,  one for lemons and a larger one for oranges ,  etc )  .  while it seems to work ,  it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black & decker ,  but what the heck ,  it's worth trying .the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it .  at first i was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options ,  but after thinking about it ,  you only need the provided on ,  off and pulse .would i buy it again ?  absolutely .  would i buy it again from amazon ?  again ,  absolutely .  the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised
i have recived serveral comments on how good these knifes look .  i am in fact very pleased with the way they look ,  but even more important is how well they perform .  they cut wonderfully  ( for me at least ,  but i'm used to cheapy knifes )  .  yes they will in fact rust ,  although i haven't had this problem with my set  ( had them for about four months now )  because i only handwash them and dry them immediately .   one steak knife found it's way into the dishwasher and sure enough it came out with a little rust spot ,  this was easily removed with a little steel wool .   you just have to weight the benefits of the all metal knifes to those that are wood handled or plastic
works great !   makes small amounts of delicious coffee !   very handy
having now owned this device for three months ,  i found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there isn't any or no way to get any .  its lightweight ,  very portable and compact .  while listed as a coffee maker ,  it brewed very slowly and not all that well .  but as a hot water heater ,  it served fantastically well .  the typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4-5 minutes ,  so little patience is needed .  the device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses .there's an automatic shut off ,  the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold .  it also come with a small spoon .  machine often come on by itself even before you hit the  " on "  button ,  probably if you hit the button before you plug it in .  i would recommended that you have everything set up before hand .i used this device at work quite a bit and found it to be super handy thanks to the small size .  the following products could be considered as tailored made for this device :  lipton cup a soup  ( sheer perfect for this machine )  ,  general food international coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands .  it also great for tea bags as well .  i am not sure about brewing tea though .overall ,  this device come highly recommended for anyone who might like to have a hot drink when there's none available
yes ,  it is just a ladle ,  but a very handy one indeed !  !  !  !  !  i find myself using this ladle just about everyday ,  than in the dishwasher and on to tomorrows pot .   it is a great quality tool that i am sure to use a lifetime .  .
we are replacing all our coated pans .   this is a great pa
i sent this knife to my son who is a baker by profession--he loves this knife .   it doesn't mash the bread and cuts through crusty crusts !  i higly recommend it to anyone
so cliche .  .  . but i am forced to learn this lesson over & over .   i thought to myself $100 for a rice cooker ,  and bought a $20 one in chinatown .   it gave me nothing but trouble .  .  . soggy rice ,  sometimes burned at the bottom ,  et cetera .  .  .with a friend's suggestion ,  i made the switch .  .  . i decided to invest in this zojirushi rice cooker and it has been coming out right everytime .you won't be disappointed
i've used this set for several years now  and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives .  even though i also own global and shun kitchen knives ,  i find myself being drawn to the insignia knives when i am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project .  although both the global and the shun have sharper edges ,  their price difference doesn't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get .  that is to say ,  yes global and shun knives are sharper ,  but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that .using my insignia knives ,  i am able to quickly dice ,  cut ,  and slice through onions ,  carrots ,  chicken ,  roasts ,  etc .  that said ,  there are several cavets that need to be stated .  first ,  don't wash these knives in a dishwasher .  it has nothing to do with the quality of the steel .  i wouldn't wash my ken onion shun chef's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the insignia .  second ,  these knives need to be honed regularly .  a few strokes after every use makes a real difference .  third ,  after owning the knives for almost two years ,  i sharpened each of the knives on oil stones .  these knives ,  like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time .  the good news is that they resharpened quite nicely ,  a tribute to their quality .  since resharpening ,  they have continued to hold their edges .last ,  the balance of these knives is more than adequate .  i also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series .  all though i am a bit of a knife snob ,  and although i would love to purchase a block set of either the shun or the globals ,  i can't justify it given that the insignia's cut so well .  my wife would really give me no end of grief if i threw out a perfectly good set of knives .  and a good set of knives these are
i picked this up on a special promotion for ~$20 ,  and for that price it is unbeatable .   has held up for years of regular use & dishwasher cleaning .   be sure to get some soft spatulas with your first non-stick pan purchase .  .  .
great little item and we use it every week .  wonderful with non-stick surfaces .  i want another one
this pot is a perfect medium-sized saucepan .  the double handles are a great feature .  we use it at least once a day in our kitchen .  the non-stick surface is extremely durable ,  although i'm not sure i would use metal utensils with it .  i use a blue scrub sponge to clean it .  i'm not sure i would use the more abrasive ,  green 3m pads .  overall a very durable ,  high-quality cooking utensil .  in fact i'm back here today to buy one for a friend
i love to have a dinner party with a cake in this case .   it's elegant and gets compliments from all .   i have found it to be sturdy enough ,  as mine came in one piece and is not broken or cracked .   this is a very nice case .   cake looks even more tempting
this is what i use when making a roux and when i need to break up ground meat while cooking .   it's nice and heavy and feels good in my hand .  i have cheaper wooden products and they don't hold up as well as this does .   you can tell the difference between oxo wooden utensils and others because of the quality .   i think you can put it in the dishwasher but i never do .  i hand wash it and oil it whenever i oil my cutting board .    i love its rich color .   it's a great product
this is my first le creuset casserole .  when i first received it ,  it was smaller than i was expecting .  but after cooking with it couple times ,  i really fall in love with it !  now i always clean it after using ,  and have it on my stove top in the kitchen !  it's so cute and fun
three months after a purchase and i still haven't seen it
i have the four piece set of these silicone utensils ,  and have been very pleased with them .   they are heat resistant ,  heavy-duty ,  and look sharp .    they are slightly flexible ,  but i have not found this to be a problem unless you want to do heavy scraping with the turner .    the best part is the wonderful easy-clean properties of the silicone .    my other heat-resistant utensils always look icky and need to be scrubbed with a scouring pad to clean the textured finish .    these look great right out of the dishwasher !    i've had them for a year and they've held up great .    the turner has not disintegrated on the edge ,  either ,  like many other types do .   the smooth finish allows food to slip right off without sticking as you're cooking
these sheets feel like you want them too .  heavy and soft .  worth every penny .  this is the second time i've bought them from amazon i can't see any reason to buy any other kind
we now have two of these units .  they are quieter than other hepa air filtration units we have had ,  do a better job of cleaning the air ,  and have excellent product support .
my dad originally bought one of these woks from lodge and we use it for everything .  we can brown all sorts of meats for varying dishes .  for stir-frying it is incredible ,  nothing sticks to it and we don't have to  worry about even cooking .  i have recently purchased one for myself and i  couldn't be happier with it .  at less than 50 is is a great bargain .  another  great use for it is deep frying .  it is a tad heavy so do not try to pick it  up and serve because it will very easily slip from your hands .  overall my  favorite cooking tool ever
i have owned my fair share of indoor grills ,  from a foreman grill to a really heavy grill pan which i ordered through amazon .  not too long ago i recently acquired the calphalon grill pan because my foreman grill is too small if i want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time .  plus the black coating on my foreman grill is wearing out .  so i bought the calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store .  i haven't been able to get enough of it .  it is so easy to clean even when i had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed ,  garlic ,  shallots ,  and extra virgin olive oil .  the marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it wasn't non-stick .  i also like using the calphalon grill pan because i can cook both the meat and vegetable  ( say asparagus )  at the same time .  the results are fabulous .  i get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste .  although it is a bit big for this apartment dweller ,  i still consider this grill pan the best of all the indoor grills i have owned .  well worth the money too
all i needed was an iron to get the wrinkles out of my cloths for school and this did a very good job .  now to be honest ,  this is the first iron that i've owned so i don't have anything to compare it will but none the less ,  for me ,  it did it's job
i am a great cook but not a good bread baker .  this machine is a joy ,  a godsend ,  i love it .  easy to use ,  easy to clean and it never fails .  buy it now-you won't be sorry .  i had 2 different breadmakers before this one-they shall remain nameless-just buy this one .  i have had mine for 2 years this christmas-what fun i have had with it
i had tried a different ice cream maker that you had to freeze the bowl and returned it .  it was too annoying to keep freezing the bowl and it took up too much space in my freezer .  i love the cuisinaret ice-50bc it makes great ice cream .  the only negative is the noise and that's why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 .  it is extremely noisy so i pretty much have to leave the room when it's on .  i do recommend the ben and jerry's ice cream book but wish they would revise it or do another one .  see my review on it
i got a set of four of these same steak knives for christmas 2004 ,  and they've been excellent .  they've seen constant use and are still razor-sharp .it's been a real revelation to me :  so this is what good kitchen knives are like ,  and this is why they cost more than the lightweight stuff !i've never had a genuinely good chef's knife ,  paring knife ,  etc .  but when i'm ready to get a serious set ,  i know exactly what brand i'll buy
i got this as a gift from my mother when i moved to my first apartment away from home .  she already had one ,  and loved it .   i use mine quite frequently ,  and makes quick work of dicing onions and peppers for philly steaks or burgers .   my brother and father have also since purchased these units .   i have had mine going on 5 years now ,  not a problem with it .   great value ,  good gift for cooks for one or two ,  who do not need a huge unit to chop stuff .
i have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually haven't gotten another for the past 6 years .  i've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase .  finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster .  it's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting .  worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but i'm sure braun is cringing if they read this !  i love the little pull out tray ,  you don't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death !  the toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time .  slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem .  it is fast too ,  so you won't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster .  i think you will be pleased with this great toaster ,  i am
tried this on my favorite but often dull chefs knife and after 4-6 strokes was very very sharp .   works great as promised .   casing cheap so not sure how long that will last or if it will hamper it's operation .  compact ,  stores well ,  would be great for motor home or other small kitchen .   for $29 ,  makes me wonder what the $99 version does that amazon also carries .  knocked a star off for the cheap plastic case
i've had my set for about a year a half .   i haven't had one speck of rust - i wonder if they had a bad batch at some point ?  ?   i would definately take them back .   i can see how they'd be too big/heavy for kids - but for adults they're great .   fit the contours of your mouth very nicely .   i use mine with fiestaware and they look great together
we originally bought the product for our toddler's room and then ended up buying a second vornado for our master bedroom .   this is an excellent buy for several reasons .  first ,  it is sleek and stylish ,  especially given its neutral color .   second ,  it provides a great wind speed given its small size .   third ,  it provides a constant soothing wind sound ,  which is great for drowning out any annoying pheripheral noises .   lastly ,  i have not seen the product in a retail store any cheaper than on amazon . com .   we have had the product over 8 months with nightly use with no sign of defficiency in performance
i really enjoy cooking with the combo grill/griddle ,  its saves a lot of time on breakfast ,  lunches and dinners you get more meals at one tim
i've had this processor for about three months .  on the first day ,  i decided to make bread ,  and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine .  when i called customer service to help me figure out what i did wrong ,  they told me that occasionally ,  this processor's dough blade fuses to the machine .  i couldn't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together .  fortunately ,  the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately .  i received my second new processor ,  and tried to make cookies .  this time ,  everything worked fine ,  and the machine is quiet .  i can even talk on the phone when using this food processor .  i'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly
this combo is awesome !   i've used coconut oil  ( very little--it doesn't burn or smoke when heated )  to season it and the press gets better with each use .   i use olive oil for the meat or bread i'm cooking and ,  although a steak wasn't seared as much as i would have liked ,  the pannini are outstanding .   the coconut oil seems to season without coloring so much and this is the first time in a very long life that i've correctly seasoned a pan .   residue now just slips off with hot water and a natural bristled brush .   please read the use and care instructions--i don't usually but for some reason sat down and did--you will find them very informative .   i love it
le creuset's grills ,  woks ,  and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be  " seasoned "  like tradiitonal cast iron .  there are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this .  basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan ,  the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes .  let the pan cool ,  remove the oil with a paper towel ,  and repeat two or three times .  a surface  " patina "  builds up that is quite non-stick .  from now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel .  in the case of burned-on food ,  a brief soak in soapy water works well .  as the pan is used the patina continues to build .   le creuset's omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick .   the textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating .   i own a le creuset wok ,  a square grill pan ,  and three frying pans with this textured finish and i find that they work fine after being seasoned this way .  i also own a le creuset omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating .  this pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations .  the textured finish pans work well for grilling meats ,  stir fries ,  and other hardier preparations .   if you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your le creuset wares and a small amout of pam or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems .
this electric water heater feels very solid and well built .  when filled to 1 . 7 liters ,  it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil .  the kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished .  i thought this would be annoying ,  but it is not !  also ,  when switched on ,  there is a nice white led lighting up the water supply making it easy to read .my only complaint about this kettle is that it is rather loud  ( which is why i only gave it 4 stars )  when it is on .  a few moments after the switch is turned on ,  it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation
i received this cleaver as graduation present when i finished culinary school and i have been thankful ever since .  this is a really nice looking cleaver .  the handle is excellent .  it looks great feels just right in my hand .  it has a good weight to it so that i am able to cut through bones and large pieces of meat with no trouble at all .  and with a name like henckels you cannot go wrong
i own this pan and the bavarian and chrysanthemum models too .   i think nordicware makes very innovative designs which makes their flaw even more disappointing .   after a few uses ,  everytime i bake with these pans the cake always stick .   i grease and flour these pans before baking and the cake still sticks .   one reviewer said to liberally grease these pans ,  but i don't understand why there's so much work for greasing a  " non-stick "  pan .   i had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no  " non-stick "
i totally love this pan !i bake cakes all the time using this and other hoffritz pans and they are absolutely wonderful .  i was first impressed by the weight of the pan ,  the non-stick sufrace ,  and the even heat distribution .  i noticed a remarkable difference in the quality of my cakes from the very first time i used the pan .  not only do my cakes look and taste great ,  i never have to worry about my cakes getting stuck to the pan or being lopsided .i'll never buy a cheap pan again .  it's really is worth the extra couple of dollars .  i doubt i'll ever have to replace any of the pans i've bought from them .  i also purchased the hoffritz springform pans and 9 "  rounds ,  same great results
these cup are enormous !   ( not to mention beautiful ,  in that fun and elegant way that only fiestaware can be .  )  i was looking for a very large ,  oversized mug because i drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly .  i definately got my wish .  i have eaten soup and cereal out of these ,  i even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently .  very cute !  i plan on getting them in all of the six colors i have in fiestaware .  let me tell you again ,  this cup is huge
i suppose color choices would be nice ;  choice is almost always good .   but my smaller golden loves it .   she likes the view it gives her and it's room and she doesn't paw at the sides .   my larger golden  ( 118 lbs - and no he's not fat ;  he's just a tall ,  tall golden )  would paw at the sides and that could spell disaster with this crate .   she thinks is very cool and i like the weight of it for being prepared to hit the road when the next hurricane is announced .   he has a big folding metal crate and that suits him
i had one many years ago and never had a problem .  good suction ,  maybe a little loud ,  but i don't care .   i liked it so much i'm trying to get a new one .   i don't recall ever having a problem with it like other reviewers have mentioned -- smoking ,  etc .   it worked well and cleaned well
fabulous !  !  !   i purchased this as a gift for relatives who are very highly educated ,  worldy ,  well travelled ,  serious chefs ,  who've enjoyed coffee brewed all over the world  ( even antarctica !  )  .   needless to say ,  gift buying for them is tricky !   when they got this ,  their bodum decanter had just broken ,  so the timing was perfect .  .  . they love this model !  use it daily !   in fact ,  they're so impressed ,  that they now order it from amazon . com & give it as a wedding gift to newly married couples in their social circle .   also note ,  there is a coordinating sugar & creamer set available for purchase that matches perfectly ,  holds adequate volumes of sugar & cream ,  & makes a stunning table display .   i already have a few bodum sets ,  including the stainless steel insulated models ,  so i won't need another fp ,  but i also will give this frieling model as a wedding/housewarming gift to coffee aficionados .
i have used a revere teakettle for 41 years .  to clean it .  .  . all you need to do is take some easy off oven cleaner  ( spray type )  and spray the stainless steel part .  this cleans all the grease spatters and any other spatters you get on it .  leave the easy off on until you see that you can wipe off the stains .  wipe ,  rinse and dry .  it will look brand new
this is great for making poached eggs on toast .   my family has enjoyed using it so far
i recieved this cake plate a couple weeks ago .  it's very heavy and well made .  it came boxed extra well .  the box was inside another box surrounded by air bags .   there was no way this thing was going to be broken .  i am happy with my purchase
henckels twin signature 7-piece block set is exactly what i'd hoped that it would be :  a quality set of knives that is ideal for the home .the set of henckels that i've owned since the mid-80s finally gave in to a lot of use ,  sharpenings and dishwashings  ( dishwashing a good knife is a nice way to shorten the handle's life expectancy !  )  .  but 20 years of great service from my previous set of henckels certainly warranted a loyal update/upgrade to another henckels set .and i am not disappointed .  the new set is quite sturdy .  home users will be impressed with their strength ;  pros might be used to a higher standard ,  but i used to work in a professional kitchen and i can't see how these would not be as effective as anything a pro has .these knives come out of the box sharp too .  .  . a lot sharper than the sharpest that i've ever had my previous set sharpened to .there were two descriptions from amazon that tell you what you get ;  one of amazon's descriptions included a carving knife  ( product description )  and the other a peeling knife  ( what's in the box )  .  amazon seems to have corrected the error as of this updated 2-13-2006 writing .  to be sure ,  here's what you actually get :- 2 1/2 "  peeling knife- 4 "  paring knife- 5 "  serrated knife- 8 "  chef's knife .  .  . this baby cuts through a roast like a hot knife through butter even though it's designed for chopping and dicing .  in my opinion ,  it's better than a carving knife .- a sharpening steel- kitchen shears- and a storage block with 11 slots which is great because some of the knives ,  especially the serrated knives ,  from my old set are still in mint shape  ( like the 8 "  bread knife )  ,  so there's plenty of room in the block for knives in your current collection looking for a new place to sleep .no 8 "  carving knife .  but like i said above ,  the 8 "  chef's knife works better than any carving knife that i've used .the only things missing from this set for the average home is a nice large bread knife  ( as i said this was not a problem for me )  and steak knives  ( also not a problem as most households already have these )  .  plain and simple ,  this is a great set of food preparation knives that--if my previous set is any indication--will last for decades .bon appetite .
ordered on june 4 and received on june 12  ( one day earlier than anticipated )  .   was thrilled with the quality and even more with the fact that it comes fully assembled except for the adjustable shelves which are a snap to put in .   nice looking cabinet and i may order another one at a later date .   couldn't be happier with the product and with the servic
i have bought over 6 of these for friends and family ,  everyone that sees it ,  has to have one ,  we make alot of our own jewelry ,  so we have plenty of bracelets and earrings .   this keeps it organized so you can match colors to the outfit you are wearing .   it is the best !   very good quality too
i love this carafe---no drips like others i have used !  the best part was how fast i recieved it----amazon was so efficient----i ordered it and before i knew it---it was here !  !
this is one of my favorite knives - and i have quite a collection of them ,  believe me .   it's sturdy ,  sharpens easily ,  and seems to contour to my hand when chopping .   i'm a faster sous chef for myself and others with this knife .   great price ,  i might add .   this brand across the board is one of my all-time favorites .   i've never been disappointed with a knife i purchased from victorinox
i had heard that the shape of riedel wine glasses enabled one to maximize the  " nose "  of a wine .    how very true !   i was amazed how much more of the wine's bouquet was immediately noticeable with these glasses .   and ,  they feel great in your hands .   i highly recommend them for wine enthusiasts
this is a great food slicer for the home kitchen ,   ( dont compare apples with oranges ,  this isnt a commercial slicer ,  but it wasnt advertised as one either )  it works great for anything from bacon to tomatos .  it has a powerfull motor and a very sharp blade with infinite thinkness adjustments up to a 1/2&quot ;  ,  easy to clean and very well built .  if you want a good slicer for home use you'll be happy with a waring food slicer
this grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen .  it's very solidly built ,  unlike the old ones i have ,  and the non-skid base is pure genius .  the grating surface is nice and sharp .  i love the container that catches whatever you've grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid .  although the container faithfully catches the grated material ,  there will be some spillage - from the outside of the grater - especially with cheese .  one caveat :  since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use ,  you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating .  yup ,  i realized this the hard way ,  and boy was it a mess !  despite this ,  i highly recommend this kitchen essential
i have other oxo items that i like very much ,  but these stainless steel measuring cups are a big disappointment .   i also experienced the handle bending easily when packing in brown sugar .   they will be in my next yard sale
this is the knife you need to slice your bread .   i wondered why my old knife and new breadmaker didn't get along .   this knife solved the problem .   you get nice ,  clean ,  even slices of bread with this knife .   for me ,  it is the nicest thing to happen to make even ,  sliced bread ,  a reality in my kitchen
you could almost use these incredibly practical and beautiful dishes in place of fine china .  however ,  if you look too closely at the ivy print ,  you'll notice that the  " ink dots "  are rather large .  .  .  more like a coarse newspaper photo print than the printed pictures in most magazines .  if only they had printed these with higher quality .  .
i had never tried yogurt cheese before ,  but i was intrigued by the idea .   making the yogurt cheese was simple with this device - just fill with yogurt and leave it in the fridge .   the product seems sturdy and was easy to clean .   we grow our own raspberries ,  and i have been eating them with ice cream .   last night i tried eating them with non-fat yogurt cheese sweetened with a bit of sugar .   it was delicious and much healthier !   yogurt cheese is a good source of calcium and protein - half a cup has 85 calories ,  10 grams protein ,  10 grams carbohydrate ,  and 235 mg calcium .  it would be great for layering with fruit in parfaits
a wonderful product .   everything cooks very evenly .   no sticking .   so easy to wash and store also
this peeler is amazing ,  and really inexpensive .  i am really please with how easily it takes the skin off of cucumbers ,  carrots ,  etc .  this is definetly a great item
this product was exactly what i was looking for and now that i have it i am very pleased in the way it works .   it is a darn good steamer
great kit however the book that comes with the kit needs some work .  the photos in the book are not accurate with the descriptions .  i recommend that if you need canning instructions or recipes you get a separate book
i love this rice cooker !  it replaced one i had for many years , and was sure i would never find another i liked as well .   i was wrong .  this rice cooker is absolutely the best .  it has replaced the broken one hands down .  the rice is perfect every time whether you make 2 servings or serve a crowd ,  it keeps it warm without ruining it and it is so easy to clean and store .   i would recommend this one to anyone that really likes rice and prepares it often .
this food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen .   for salsas ,  the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky .  for sauces ,  the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients .  my favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears .   the large bowl not only holds alot ,  but is also very  easy to clean .  i highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook
ok ,  this is obviously not the same as the traditional all clad stockpots ,  if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one .  it is part of the disk bottom collection ,  however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made .  i certainly would not consider it secondary .  it is a little lighter in weight than the traditional all clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means .  it is great for sauce ,  soup ,  stew ,  etc .  you will love it and you can't beat the price .  it is very easy to clean .  a+keep an eye out ,  there is always some kind of rebate or gift with most cooking purchases both on amazon and in department and cooking stores .   i actually got this stock pot free when i purchased my all-clad roti pan set which also came with a rack and turkey lifters in filene's .   i would have bought it anyway ,  it is an excellent stockpot and the price can't be beat .tip :  if you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called  " bar keepers friend "  to clean it .  most supermarkets have it and kitchen etc .  and bed ,  bath and beyond carry it too .  the container  ( like a comet can )  is gold with blue and white writing .  all clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive .
great product ,  does what it's suppose to do .   brushes are the best .   i have three huskies and it handles the dog hair expertly without clogging up .   for being such a heavy ,  beastly unit ,  i cannot understand why the handle is built for such a petite hand .   it should be at least an inch longer so i can actually fit my hand in to it
hey ,  not to be too redundant but this really is a good can opener .  i have no problems with it ,  my wife ,  who always has problems with can openers has  " some "  problems  " sometimes "  using it but as she never could get any of the others to ever work this is a big improvement .  the knife sharpener is an okay touch ,  however ,  if you have good knives i wouldn't use it .  i sharpen by hand with an  " edge pro "  but hey ,  it's a can opener .  it will sharpen a knife i just wouldn't put my $100 schaaf  " golden hamster "  through ,  maybe my chicago for a quick fix
i just keep buying more of these glasses ,  including other sizes and shapes .  they look good and are great at keeping drinks hot or cold
this little grill is not so little ,  with a large grill surface ,  but it takes up so little space on my apartment's patio - so it is perfect for those of us who only have a small patio or balcony .  it is easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  and grills perfectly - no mess ,  no fuss .
i'm a student at a massage therapy school and i only have two sheet sets ,  so i wash these at least twice a week and they aren't showing any wear at all  ( i've had them for about 2 months )  .   i don't really care for the color ,  but i get complements on my sheets often .   the order arrived a week earlier than i had expected .i couldn't be more pleased
this pan is perfect .   not too big ,  nor too small for a perfect soup .  for the price ,  you can't get better .   this pan replaces my farberware 6 quart ,  and overall ,  it isn't any bigger ;  just holds 2 quarts more .   love it
i purchased this for my mom .   her main criteria being a large size kettle .   she reports that she  " loves it "  and that it heats up very quickly
i'm sure that you will love this set as much as my family and i do !each piece is durable and good looking !   my original set was also by sango ,  and i gave it away after 20 years only because my decor had changed dramactically .   now my neighbor is enjoying my original service for 12 .   i expect to enjoy my new gold dust set for at least ,  the next 20 years
all coffee grinders leave a bit of a mess so don't let the comments about stray grinds deter you .all the reviewers who used flavored beans need to be discounted since that is not recommended .   others seem to have trouble with the  " door "  which is really just a deflector for the grind .  you get a few grinds on the counter but that is a small price to pay for delicious fresh coffee .th a-9 has a strong relatively quiet motor  ( which means it is still loud ,  but not as loud as most other burr grinders0 and takes up very little counter space .  the glass hopper for the beans seals at the top with a scrw on lid .i love the idea of the measuring cup which saves a lot of time scooping .it eliminates that step .  .  . just grind until you have the right amount and dump it into your coffee basket .kitchen aid has a nice pro model that costs twice as much by why pay more for less
i was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable .  i thought a french press would be a great idea ,  but all of them seemed to be made of glass and i didn't want to leave my press laying around where i work  ( we share space with other companies so people come and go )  .  with this mug all i have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea  ( and maybe some sugar )  .  wait a bit ,  push down the press and drink .  the whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber .  the bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh .i read another review of the mug somewhere and they complained about getting coffee grinds coming through .  well let me say this mug has a double filter ,  one on the plunger part of the press and one on the lid where you drink or pour from .  coffee used for french press preperation is supposed to be a coarse grind .  i think that person tried using store bought ground coffee or just didn't know any better and put finely ground coffee in .  the mug will do a pretty good job even with coffee like that ,  but some is bound to get through that way and you get a muddy cup besides the point so use coffee made for french press brewing not finely ground coffee and you will love this mug
i love these dishes .   they are lead-free and you can do so much with them because they are a solid color .   i liked the sea mist color even more when i saw the actual dishes--it is very soothing to the eye ,  and i don't think that i will get tired of it as i might with one of the brighter or darker colors .
the vacu vin wine saver works great ,  it keeps wine fresh in the refrigerator for weeks .  also it is very easy to use
nordic ware makes the best looking pans ,  but this is my favorite pan from nordic ware !   this pan makes beautiful breads and cakes .   because it has a  non-stick coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher  setting when baking .   and even though it is non-stick ,  i suggest that you  spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick !   it's also  very easy to clean up
these knives are excellent quality .  they hold an edge and are well balanced .  this oxo set is a real bargain .other than a butcher knife ,  this set is all most households will ever need .  it's is a natural for a wedding gift
i ordered all three colors of these mugs - red ,  blue and white .   the blue and white mugs have a shiny ,  even glaze .   the red glaze is mottled and has more of a matte finish ,  giving it a more rustic ,  country look .   the mugs are great but the three different colors look very different and really don't match each other .
sentry insulated chestevery household should have some method of protecting things like birth certificates ,  deeds ,  wills ,  stocks ,  bonds ,  and other valuables .pros :- inexpensive box helps keeps your valuables  " safe "  from fire ,  kids ,  and nosey adults .- attractive ;  has nice handle ;  no sharp edges .- excellent value for the money .cons :- flat key model  ( sen1100 )  has a rather cheap-looking lock mechanism .- it weighs nearly 20 pounds ,  but that's because the walls are 1 "  thick and fire-resistant material isn't light .go to sentrysafe dot com to view all the sentry offerings .my advice is to buy the sentry model 2100 rather than this model  ( sen1100 )  .   the 2100 has a better  ( tubular key )  lock ,  but only costs a few dollars more .    ( staples dot com sells the 2100 .  )   sentry rates these boxes as follows :1100 - ul classified - 30 minute fire protection2100 - etl verified for 30 minute fire protection of cds and dvds up to 1550 degrees fno small fire-box is particularly theft resistant .   even if bolted down ,  a lid could be forced opened with tools .   in addition ,  although the 2100's fire rating is higher than the 1100 ,  many non-portable safes offer better fire ratings .   they are also larger and far more expensive .   for better protection ,  you'd need to spend more money ,  but a sentry chest is much better than doing nothing .i use mine to store dvd backups of computer files .   the sentry chest is kept inside a large ,  fire-resistant safe .   hopefully ,  this double protection will do the job if there is ever a fire .   dvd and other computer media will be destroyed at much lower temperatures than paper .i'm a retired federal employee and have no connection whatever to any manufacturer of any product
so far our food processor has been great .  we bought it to make our own baby food ,  and since then we have used it to make many other things as well .  i'm very happy with it
i needed a set of knives like yesterday i had a  [  .  .  .  ]  set of chicago cutlery knives they lasted 2 years the blades chipped and resharpen them were impossible because of the chipping ,  the handles faded and they had rust spots and i am not hard on knives i even hand washed them most of the time .  so i bought these knives because they were henckles and the never needed sharpening .  i have had them 3 months they are perfect for me .  they are made in china .3 of the knives got rust spots after 2 washing i called the company and they ask me to return the defectived knives and they replaced them in a very timely manner .so for 49 . 99 i have knives that look great work great and if there is any problem the company will replace them .so you can't go wrong
this dust bin is a helping hand to the disabled that have difficulties bending and to workshop craftsman
le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products .  these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once .  for this reason ,  one pan may look like another ,  but each is unique in its own way .cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat .  due to this efficiency ,  it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat .   over heating may cause foods to stick to the pan ,  or worse burn and can cause the enamel to appear stained .   remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly .  this helps your food stay warm while serving .  the opposite holds true as well ,  chill the pan and it will retain its chill for a surprisingly long time .   beware ;  iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials .cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel ?  iron tends to rust ;  iron oxide  ( rust )  doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food .  if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled ,  you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface .  adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good ,  but has multiple benefits .  the enamel ,  being a solid coating ,  is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on ,  does not stain ,  absorb odors ,  retain flavors ,  and is easy to clean .  the enamel can be damaged ,  so limit contact to heat resistant plastic or wood utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain .the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many ,  but lets get down to the french oven ,  cocotte or as it's also referred to ,  the dutch oven specifically .   french ovens have been manufactured by le creuset for over 75 years ,  and were developed well before then .   in all this time the design has stayed constant ,  affirming the relevance of its cooking qualities .   these ovens come in either oval or round shapes .   the oval shape works well for roasting whole chickens and porkloin roasts ,  otherwise the differences are minimal .this pan holds 6 3/4 quarts of food ,  measures 9 1/2 x 12 inches or 24 x 30 cm internal diameter ,  4 3/4 inch or 11 1/2 cm deep ,  and weighs 13 pounds .   the domed lid provides a tight seal ,  trapping in moisture to roll back into the dish .   the lid may alternatively be used as a holding plate for chopped vegetables or meat during initial preparations .   be sure to lift the pan off of cooking surfaces to reduce damaging either the pan or the surface .   french oven tends to do best if at least 3/4 full .  any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot .french ovens were developed for slow cooking by stewing ,  braising or boiling .   some typical dishes include roasts ,  and stews .   other possibilities include gumbos ,  chili ,  dirty rice ,  baked beans ,  swedish meatballs ,  osso bucco ,  or curing ice cream to name a few .one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost .  the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials .  heck ,  cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping .  however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced .  they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans .  if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products ,  the cost tends to make sense .  then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of .pros :efficient absorption and distribution of heathygienic enamel cooking surfacedoes not stain ,  absorb odors ,  or retain flavorscleans easily when not abused or misusedcan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the tableeasily lasts a lifetimecons :its heavy ,  as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 13 pound
i adore this flatware !  the weight ,  the clean lines ,  and beautiful shape !  however ,  it only gets 4 stars because the knives develop rust spots when put in the dishwasher .  to prevent rusting ,  i have to hand wash them .  admittedly ,  it's inconvenient and not something everyone wants to do .  the spoons and forks seem to do just fine in the dishwasher so i don't know what's wrong with the knives .  i'm assuming they're made differently .  gourmet settings ,  the manufacturer ,  does have a warranty on the flatware so if you buy this set you may want to ,  or have to ,  make use of this
i just finished washing this pan ,  which i choose to use at an increasing rate .  it washes up with ease ,  who needs non stick ?  looks beautiful ,  more importantly ,  i love cooking in it .  perfect size !  the only problem is ,  i won't let the men in the household use it ,  hmmm
buyer beware !  i agree with the other reviews ,  these plates are beautiful !  great size and shape .   however ,  i used them for the first time last night at a dinner party and the bottoms of the plates and cups are so rough they scratched my solid oak ,  espresso stained table !   each place a cup or plate was set that wasn't on a placemat there were small scratches left behind .  if you always use a table cloth or have a granite or stone table they would be fine ,  but i wouldn't ever put them on a quality wood table again .  fortunately amazon makes returning easy
best 20$ i've ever spent .  it does have some flaws as stated previously in other reviews ,  the knobs are hard to read but i've found that i use it so much that i really don't need to be able to see it anymore .  the thermometer seems stable ,  i never have a problem with it getting too hot in the winter ,  and it manages to heat my efficiency apartment very well .  the cord is 'regular' length so it's not tiny and i don't need an extension cord .  over all on a students budget i've definitely found a winner
this may sound odd ,  but this is the first steamer that i have ever had .  so needless to say ,  i do not have others to compare it to .  however , i find that i use it more than i thought i would !  the unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that i most use for vegies and the like ,  and when i pull out the sides  ( the steaming tray )  it fits nicely up the sides of the pot .  besides your basic steamed vegies ,  i find that it's perfect for warming up leftovers like rice ,  leaving it hot and fluffy .  i like that the handle extends ,  so you can keep the cover on it while cooking ,  but you can extend the handle for easier lifting .  and you can't beat the price
this product is great for making mashed potatoes .   i love it ,  it is well made and sturdy .   my kids like to turn the handle and i do not have to worry about any electric blades cutting their fingers .   the price is very good for this item .  i prefer non electric kitchen gadgets ,   ( to save space )  and this one is great .
i have used different brands of dust busters but this one by far has out done them .  the battery lasts and the power is very good .  also shipping was prompt .  nothing else i can add .  all over very good .  thank you ,  i shall return .  a . f .  island par
this is simply the best pan i own .  *if* you follow the directions on how to cook with this pot ,  you won't have a problem with sticking .  it's easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  works for just about everything  ( except maybe making pancakes - for which you would want a non-stick griddle )  .  i just love being able to use metal utensils with this pot and not having to worry about scratching it .  love it
i am really pleased with this purchase .  this cookware far exceeded my expectations .  it's heavyweight but not too heavy .  i just love the cool touch handles .  i would recommend this set very highly .  if you cook alot like i do you will be more than happy with this set .
we purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house .   at 14 ,  he is the oldest of 5 - all indoors .   we put it on the bed  ( his favorite daytime nap spot )  .   he loves it ,  but so do the other four .   they all try to squeeze in on it ,  with him ,  or take it over when he gets up .   it's never empty !   it has a bit of a  " crinkly "  noise but they don't seem to mind it after they try it .  it seems to work great and very easy to keep clean .   the patterned side can be de-furred with a few quick swipes of your hand ,  following the direction of the fabric nap .   good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats
boy ,  do i love this piece !  i got mine for a lot less at an outlet store and it's just wonderful .  i love the purple color - it's just gorgeous in a tuscan kitchen and this piece looks marvelous on the table .  it does wonderfully in the oven - it's not overly big so don't get it to feed a family of 5 or so .   it's about 1 . 5 quarts .   i get tons of compliments on these pieces and the purple ,  well ,  it's just original and if you're afraid of it ,  don't be .  it's just a gorgeous color and one that i'm very glad to have introduced into my kitchen .  i'm getting more !  highly recommended piece .
this ice cream scoop recieved a great review in a cooking magazine so i bought it and love it
it works great ,  it's healthier than microwave popcorn ,  and in the long run it's cheaper too .  pour in half a cup of kernels ,  plug it in ,  and within a couple minutes you've got a bowl full of fresh popcorn with only a few unpopped kernels and virtually no cleanup .  it's not much louder than most microwave ovens and it's far less likely to burn the popcorn .  only one minor complaint :  butter doesn't really melt completely in the cup on top  ( make sure you have melted butter ready to go if you want it )  .  an on/off switch might've been nice but that's not a big deal unless you want to keep it on your countertop permanently .  oh and this product is identical to the presto poplite  ( asin :  b00006iuwa )  just with a different label  ( it even says so in the description above )  ,  but you get a coupon for 50 cents off orville's with this one
i've used these for a while and they still hold up pretty well .  they say not to put them in the dishwasher but i have and the non-stick is holding up fine .  the lids fit nice and tight and the handles don't get too hot - unless you are just taking one of them out of the oven ,  in that case the handle will be hot .all said i definately recommend these cause :1 .   there is just the right pans for most situations - who really needs 15 pans ?2 .   you get good quality for the money .3 .   the non-stick is terrific
this fry cutter is good if you have a small potato and want some fries .  .  . otherwise you will need to cut your potato first .  also ,  it takes a bit of effort to use
until i purchased this meat grinder ,  i was grinding with a manual one .   it was a chore to set up and clean up .   the pro mg-800 professional meat grinder made the grinding easy .   it does not have to be clamped on the table .   ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath .   easy clean up ,  fast speed ,  three blades interchangeable for the grinding .   i am totally happy with the product i purchased .   also ,  on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing .    the advantage of having a grinder is i can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat
great for frying eggs ,  but i prefer a pan with higher sides for omlets .   every grilled sandwich i've made on this griddle has come out perfect .   my kids use it to make pancakes and they swear by it .   i've found that pre-heating the griddle in the oven first helps it heat more evenly and avoid the hot spots that can occur when cooking on a stove top .   the pre-seasoning works great
this casserole dish has some minor inconveniences .   it's made of some sort of pottery so it cools down very slowly and it's easy to let something sit for 15 minutes and come back and burn your hand .   i also learned through this dish that square casserole dishes are easier to cut brownies out of than round or oval ones .   it does however cook things just fine and is not too large for what i need it for
enjoy your sleeping hours in quality sheets with beautiful butterflies embroidered on the pillow cases & top sheets .  . an awesome deal for yourself or a gift for someone you want to bless
in my opinion :well ,  i ordered two of these ,  one for my daughter .  since i had two ,  guess what i did ?  you're right - i tested both on the same hot and cold materials to see how close they read .  well ,  they were within 1/2 degree f .  of each other ,  which in a laboratory is sloppy ,  but for cooking food ,  it's darn accurate .i have several oven thermometers ,  you know ,  the mechanical ones ,  and i use this unit to see how accurate they are .also ,  i wanted a thermometer to be able to check the temperature of thinner foods ,  such as a hamburger ,  chicken patty ,  chicken breasts .  now ,  as you know ,  when you check the temperature of these items ,  you want a really quick reading ,  because your hand is close to the heat .  well ,  it's not as quick as advertised .  it will take about 8 to 10 seconds to get a good reading ,  but that's not terribly long .  make sure you slide the temp probe through the handle so that your hand can be even further away from the fire .next ,  it can be calibrated ,  so i put it up against a $400 fluke meter ,  and it came within  . 8 degrees f ,  so i would consider it within specs .  for food preparation ,  the difference would have no meaning .finally ,  it seems to be holding up well against accidental drops and getting slightly wet .  i've bought others ,  including those ridiculous forks with the built-in thermometers ,  but this unit is the best
i received a blue set for christmas and i love them .  the stay cool handles really stay cool ,  even if you are cooking something for a long time .  they are beautiful and  iloev the way they feel .  my caphalon pans are now collecting dust in the back of the cupboard becuase i like these so much more
i used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself ,  so i have tried many cutlery products from many different brands .  in 2003 ,  i bought these calphalon contemporary shears since i did not own a pair of shears .  before i purchased these ,  i tried a pair of henckels twinshear kitchen shears ,  and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as i would have liked .  i was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in china rather than in germany or japan ,  even though newer brands such as calphalon and furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in china .  after over a year of using these ,  i am quite impressed with them .  the handles are very comfortable ,  and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned henckels shears .  most impressively ,  the blades show very little wear ,  despite the fact i have certainly used them quite often .  also ,  the handles on these are far better compared to those on the calphalon traditional and stainless shears .  in conclusion ,  i would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top-quality ,  reasonably priced set of kitchen shears
i received this item last week and immediately tried it .   it was easy to use and worked quite fast .   needed much less marinating juice to get the job done .   i wish it was also available in a bigger size for a larger group .
super easy to use ,  put in rice and water .   out comes perfect rice every time .   haven't experimented with any rice cooking recipes yet but it makes incredible white and brown rice with no though .
i have used analon cookware since 1997 .   the handle came off one of the saucepans .   before i could return it ,  my husband tossed it out .   i replaced the saucepan and purchased some additional items .   they arrived in great condition and in a timely manner .   i have used the pots and they have met my expectations .   i would like to order some of the other accessories .
this dutch oven is a workhorse in my kitchen .   i purchased it pre-seasoned because i've never had a factory-seasoned piece of cast iron cookware .   bottom line :   while the pre-seasoning was a plus ,  it's not necessary .   just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the lodge cookware ,  and you'll be fine .my family has had cast iron for generations ,  and i won't pay the exhorbitant prices for those  " upscale ,  professional "  dutch ovens that are all the rage these days .   this lodge oven browns spectacularly ,  and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one ,  that's not a problem if one simply uses one's nose .   we can all tell when enough is enough .  .  .i particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which aren't present on the more expensive ones .   these spikes allow condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and i don't have to worry about a dry product .   the lid on this oven also fits the 12-inch skillet which i own ,  and that's a plus .   it conducts heat well and when i use it camping as an oven ,  breads and biscuits come out as well as at home .yes ,  it's heavy ,  but that's the nature of cast iron ,  no ?  ?   if you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this lodge piece ,  be prepared to shell out big bucks
i love this fryer !  its just the right size for my kitchen . its not big and bulky like other fryers .  its easy to clean too .  its a winner in my book
these sheets are soft wash well and set the pace for a great night's sleep .   i love flannel sheets and these are the best so far .
i have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier .   they have excellent balance and feel .   a major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the calphalon 15 piece set .   the wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice  ( light pine with no finish )  ,  but i don't use it anyway
this listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes corelle has recently released .   this is fabulous because i was concerned that the old corelle i remember is a bit thin .  these carry a 5-year warranty vs .  the regular 3-yr .this pattern is more beautiful in person ;  the leaves have a great texture to them .  the pattern is softer and less  " limey "  in person  ( in a good way )  .  don't shy away from corelle because they aren't known for style  ( i almost did )  .  the durability and beauty of these dishes are unmatched in my opinion .   purchased two sets for special occassion dinners and everyday use
as a mathematician ,  game theorist ,  and proud chi omicron chi  ( xox ,  aka  " xocks "  )  brother ,  i have always been interested in this the simplest of m , n , k games ,  i . e .  games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row .   as every game theorist knows ,  perfect tic-tac-toe play by both players results in a tie game every time ,  with neither player achieving victory .   the clever child will figure this out on her own ,  as i did at an early age ,  and i lost interest in playing tic-tac-toe before i turned five .   i never lost interest ,  however ,  in studying tic-tac-toe and similar games ,  which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory ,  and partly accounts for my joining chi omicron chi as a college freshman .   as part of our initiation ,  pledges had to play a modified form of tic-tac-toe with vodka-filled shot glasses for markers .   each player had five glasses ,  and as he placed his marker ,  he would empty his glass .   the loser would drink the remaining shot glasses .   most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic-tac-toe ,  so really the point of the game ,  as with most fraternity games ,  was to see who could best hold his liquor .   i do remember one unfortunate pledge ,  bob ,  who never figured out how to play perfect tic-tac-toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia .all these thoughts came rushing ,  so to speak ,  back to me when i saw the  " shot glasses tic-tac-toe "  available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component .   i have a four-year-old son who has yet to perfect his tic-tac-toe game ,  so i bought this set to educate him .   we play the same way i did in the xocks fraternity house .   of course i don't give him pure vodka in his shot glasses ;  he only weighs 35 lbs .   as 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight ,  i dilute his vodka in a 1-to-4 dilution with orange juice .   i know what you're thinking :  what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses ,  including mine ?   i am nothing if not fair ,  so when he loses ,  i give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka i have remaining in my shot glasses .   since i ,  knowing how to play perfect tic-tac-toe ,  never lose to my son ,  the reverse problem ,  my having to drink his remaining shots ,  never occurs .my son loses more often than not ,  and he usually ends up walking into walls ,  falling down ,  and later becoming violently sick .   you would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic-tac-toe ,  but his cognitive development must be lacking .   i can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic-tac-toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections .   he still loves to play ,  however ,  but his game ,  if anything ,  seems to be getting worse ,  almost as if he is trying to lose
i ordered these just to make my $25 .   i'm sure they are well worth the price i paid ,  would be ideal for a one/two person family .   i will use them for gifts
while these are described as  " beer "  glasses ,  they are fantastic for keeping milk cold through a meal .   i actually pour the milk and place the glasses in the freezer while i start dinner .   these glasses are easy to clean and retain their  " sunny "  shine ,  even though we have very hard water .   no spots !   great product
you know ,  for this price ,  you could throw anything away .   but ,  this 'synthetic' comforter is so soft ,  silky and light ,  i can toss it on and not feel weighted down .   i also have a cat and with cat hairs i can vacumn them off easily  ( down is more difficult )  ,  but just having the airy warmth is worth it .
i love these oven mitts .   they have a magnet in them so you can stack them one on top of the other and stick them to your oven or refrigerator ,  or other metal surface .   they are not as cumbersome as the really long ,  heavily molded ones .   i bought them for all of my grown children and they all love them too .
i have made yogurt with a few tablespoons from the super market or with a previous batch ,  but sometimes i sweeten the whole batch with honey and forget to reserve some of the good stuff .   i probably use these every other batch or so now .when i first started making yogurt ,  using these packets allowed me to vary the time and/or add powdered milk until i found my perfect batch !   i don't add powdered milk - it makes it thicker but more tart and i prefer it a bit thinner after getting addicted to it in europe last year .this is the perfect tool for newbies - and a cupboard staple for the more seasoned yogurt-heads
i love the way cast iron cooks .   not to mention it is so nice to spend less on something that lasts longer and is easier to clean up !i do have problems lifting things sometimes ,  but this is about the same amount of work as the non-stick pans that i used to have ,  although slightly heavier ,  the handles are ergonomic and the loop on the other side of the handle compensates by making a balanced lifting motion easier .
this knife has a lot to offer as far as i'm concerned .i'm not looking for a highlife line of knives .  .  . because i have a family--all of which do not respect special care of important knives .i want a knife that cuts well .  . thats sturdy .  .  . and can take some abuse like being in water or not being  cleaned right away .i do not buy wood handles anymore either .  .  . because too  many times the knife goes in the water or is not cleaned promptly .  i also want one that will stay sanitary .  .  . or can be sanitized .this santuko by cuisinart fits the bill for me .  the weight is excellent for me .  .  . i have a large hand for a woman .  .  . and some health issues for which i prefere a lighter handling knife that cuts without a lot of pressure .  .  . and will not make my wrist ache when used  .cuts like a dream through all the fruits and veggies  i tried it on .washed up  easy and quick .  .  . dried quick too .i paid only a little bitty amount for this very  big hearted knife .i recommend it for all real cooks out there .  .  .  that also have family using your stuff
we have had this knife for about 5 months now ,  and we use it daily ;  anything from peeling and dicing fruit ,  to slivering a potato .it has a nice solid feel to it ,  and it has a remarkably sharp blade ,  which has held an edge very well .   the curved blade makes it a bit of a challenge to hone
i have a few of these wash clothes sitting in my bathroom closet .   they're beautiful in design and give you an excellent clean feeling after you've used them  ( with soap and water ,  of course )  .   looking forward to a shower just got a whole lot better
so far i have made several different ice creams in my new machine .   this is the first i'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you don't .   the machine is very efficient .   you just put the mixture in and it does all the work .   you may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others .   you just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency .   i made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it didn't thicken and i wasted all of it ,  so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine .   the machine is a little noisy but i expected that after reading about it ,  not as bad as i thought it would be though .   overall ,  very happy
i purchased this press to supplement a larger 8-cup model .    the press allows just under one standard size mug to be filled .   if you also are looking for a mug's worth of coffee ,  i would recommend purchasing the 4-cup model as that would leave just a bit more room ,  and keep more of the small grindings in the press ,  rather than in the bottom of my cup .also ,  it should be noted that bodum sells the spare parts for this press  ( right here on amazon ,  in fact )  ,  so if you should break it ,  a few dollars will get you back in java !another note ,  some people have mentioned that dumping the grindings proves problematic as you can't just put them down the drain  ( plugs up your trap )  .   i have found an easy solution in using the plastic and wire mesh grind basket of my last automatic coffee maker as a strainer .   i just pour the bit of water and grinds out of the press and into the basket  ( which i leave in the sink )  ,  and allow the water to run off .   then i pour shake the dry coffee into the trash .   no fuss ,  and the basket is dishwasher safe for the occasional cleaning
i immediately noticed the quality of this wok as soon as i took it out of the box .  very nice looking .  very easy to cook in .  it's big and has large sides so it is very easy to stir the stir fry around without spilling it .  the non stick surface works beautifully .  reattaching the wok to the base after cleaning is fairly easy although the wok never seems to lock 100% correctly into place without a little hassle .  i'm not sure it really matters if it's not perfectly 100% aligned into the base anyway .  nevertheless ,  that's only a minor gripe .  this wok makes stir fry easy and fun and makes the food taste really good .  the included spatula was a nice gesture ,  too .  the instructions say the wok can do a lot of other things too ,  like slow cooking ,  but i only use it for stir fry
first ,  the good stuff :  this peeler is sharp ,  requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable .  i like having it ,  but i'm also holding on to my cheap little oxo peeler for a couple of reasons :  first ,  the rosle produces very thick peels ,  which is a bit wasteful .  second ,  i tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me .  the rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right-handed and left-handed peeler .  that said ,  i do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction ,  which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models
i bought this as a birthday gift to myself and i love it .   i thought i would miss being able to preset my coffee timer at night to wake up to coffee ,  but this makes it so quickly that has not been a factor .   the taste is unbeatable !   even if you leave the warmer on the entire morning the coffee never tastes bitter .   highly recommended for coffee lovers !
this little unit is very versatile ,  you can use it to steam anything
this is such a great deal here on amazon .   i paid more than this at an outlet !   but ,  that said ,  this is a gorgeous butter dish and a beautiful addition to your holiday table .   i use mine throughout the holidays and winter ,  it is just so very pretty and does a great job on keeping butter fresh .   plus ,  it's very easy to clean  ( don't you love scraping those butter pieces off ?  )  by just popping it on the top shelf of a dishwasher .   mine has been used for 12 years and still looks new .
these pans are mahvelous ,  dahling .   having said that ,  i've read lots of reviews that included complaints about the strength of the adhesive used to stick the labels on the pans .   to one ,  to all :   there is a product called  " goo gone "  that is designed for just this type of thing .   you can find it almost anywhere ,  hardware stores ,  grocery stores ,  etc .   it works in minutes ,  and leaves no trace of the adhesive behind .   just be sure the wash the pan afterwards .   happy adhesive-free baking
i just needed to refute that first review also .  this is not a toy ,  it's not for mixing your ovaltine or slimfast shakes  ( though it will work for sure )  .  i assume that's what the first reviewer wanted it for .  you can get a 19 dollar piece to do that .  it's not  " about a foot long !  "  it's 17 inches ,  and needs to be .  it's also not 20 lbs .  it's 2 lbs .  and it's weight is perfect .  it's not a  " hand blender "  for mixing water .  it's an immersion blender for making the thickest of the thick and the creamiest of the creamiest as far as soups go and 50 other uses .  i'm a professional chef ,  this is part of my kit that i don't leave home without .  you shouldn't be home without it
this plate ,  the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate ,  just so you know .  it's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes .  my aunt has had the winter frost white as long as i can remember ,  and now i am slowly building my own collection .  i love them - they are very light and strong .  i tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact .  the material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds .  they are so thin and light that i could probably carry at least 35 of them .  this is perfect for your everyday meals .  highly recommended
i absolutely love this cookware .   don't be put off by the seemingly high price .   you will hand this stuff down to your kids .   what's so special about it ?   it out performs all of my other cookware  ( yes ,  even all-clad )  on the stovetop and in the oven .   the even heating is better than i could have imagined .  it will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops .   and ,  as an added bonus ,  it's the easiest to clean .   i use mine for most everything  .   .   .  pot roast ,  soup ,  stew ,  pasta sauces ,  braising ,  slow-cooking ,  etc .   it's great
the food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase .  i know i was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it's an excellent food processor and worth more than the money .  my wife loves you know guys waht that means .  also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow .  the seller was more than excellent .
i love this steamer because it fits in all clad sauce pans from 2 to 4 quarts .   the other version with the long handle doesn't fit the 2-quart .works beautifully .   easy to care for  ( dishwasher safe )  .
i must agree with everything that has been written previously .   this fan is sturdy ,  attractive ,  quiet and well-built with all the features one would want or need on a table-top fan .   and you can't beat the price .
this is an extremely nice cutting board ,  great size and easy to handle .   cleans up in a breeze .   no stains and does not dull those favorite knives .   i have the larger size but this one is my favorite
everything about this set is well done .  the packaging and the size of the plates .
i'm glad i bought this griddle !  i've been stuck with teflon-coated nonstick pans for a while ,  and when i saw such great deals on cast iron pans ,  i had to buy a few .  i ordered the griddle ,  the ~10 "  logic grill pan ,  and the ~10 "  skillet .  thankfully all three qualified for free super saver shipping ,  because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves !  the order was placed late monday night ,  and i was promised that my pans would ship by the following monday .  by wednesday the griddle had arrived ,  and the grill pan showed up on friday .  way to go ,  ups !  it turns out that its good to get these things early ,  because it takes a few days to get the  " natural finish "  pans properly seasoned .  i think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly .  food won't stick to a cast iron pan if you've taken the time to season it until it's black and almost totally non-stick .  it takes some time and paitence ,  but it's the same way with a good wok :  you get out of it what you put into it ,  and this certainly reflects in one's cooking .  iif you're going to buy one of these pans ,  do your homework !  ask google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan .  if you want to save some time ,  just buy the logic line of pans ,  because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase  ( the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original )  .  keep in mind that you will eventually have to re-season the pan ,  but hopefully not for a while  ( we'll see how the grill pan turns out )  .i agree with some of the other reviews ,  the handle could stand to be made a little longer .  i am a pretty physically fit chef ,  and i still find the griddle to be pretty hefty .  a little extra ease of carrying a heavy piece of what's usually very hot iron would be great .  i've found that grabbing it with a folded cotton  ( natural fibers don't melt !  )  towl helps ,  or if you're serious about using cast iron  ( and you like to sear meat on it )  you should invest in a pair of welder's gloves or something equally thick and heavy and fireproof .this morning i pulled the griddle out of the oven where it had spent the past few days being alternately heated ,  rubbed down with peanut oil ,  and cooled ;  and i heated it up and made pancakes .  you have not lived until you eat pancakes cooked on a hot cast iron surface .  teflon-coated pans simply cannot compare .  i can't wait to try making grilled-cheese sandwiches ,  omelettes ,  and hashed browns on this griddle .  with any luck ,  this will be the last griddle i ever need to buy  ( and hopefully the griddle my grandchildren won't have to buy )
honestly .  .  .  i do not ,  for the likes of me ,  understand why anyone would give this cookware a bad review .   it appears that those who have ,  either can't read or didn't bother .we have had our set of calphalon contemporary nonstick for several months ,  and everyone in the family  ( mom ,  dad ,  two teenage sons )  uses them .   we use and wash them as directed .   also ,  we don't use any of the  " pam "  type sprays .   so far they still look great and the foods cooked in them are delicious
i know these got poor reviews ,  as ice cube trays .   but i used them to freeze my baby's homemade fruits and veggies and they worked great .   the lids were a little tricky at first ,  but as long as you don't overfill them ,  you'll have no problems removing the lids .   a couple twists of the tray ,  and the food cubes slid right out !   they were much cheaper than trays marketed specifically for freezing baby food
since i liked it so much ,  i decided to purchase a second one the day the first one arrived .  was very disappointed to see that the price has gone up $10 in just one week !  however ,  the quality is good and i am satisfied with the item
this is the bowl that we were looking for .  we found it at several places ,  but amazon . com had the best price .  they even beat the local &quot ; discount&quot ;  cooking stor
this grill is awesome !  i ordered it to replace my old grill ,  which didn't have the removeable plates and was worn down .  the removeable grills make this so easy to clean .  .  . maybe takes 5 minutes .  i had looked at a couple of other contact grills from different manufacturers ,  and though this one was more expensive ,  i thought it had a better design than some of the others i looked it .  definitely recommended ,  don't hesitate to buy this if you're thinking about it
this is great .   i use it to grind flax seed .   it works well and is fairly easy to clean .   the cord winds up into itself ,  which is very nice ,  to keep it out of the way when storing it
i love garlic and this has been the best garlic press .  i've use this almost every day for the last 6 months and it still works and looks great !  it's definately worth the money
i like it's size ,  weight ,  and the fact that it is clear glass so you can see the tea .   i keep it warm at my desk with the aid of a coffee cup warmer and one cup will last for several hours .   the strainer works flawlessly for me
i can't believe how fast i received my pizza stone and the way it was packaged was great .   i've use pizza stones before and loved the way they even out the heat in the oven and the cripy crust that it gives .   i'll very happy with my purchase
took a few minutes to get the hang of using the rolling pin ,  after that it became a piece of cake .   i love the length ,  weight and now it is the only rolling pin that i use
i love my duvet cover .   it's extremely soft ,  softer than i expected .   the large buttons add to the charm .   i would buy another duvet cover in a heartbeat .denis
this whisk is far superior to any other i have owned .  i cook constantly and a whisk is a necessary tool .  this one is sturdy ,  reliable ,  and stands up to the most viscous mixtures .  kitchenaid is the way to go for all of your appliance and cookware needs
this knife is well worth the money .   it is not only sharp but it behaves in your hand begging to be tuned loose on meat vegetables ,  fruit you name it .   honestly ,  i felt it was too much for me but as i got better accustomed to its heft ,  i knew it was me that did not possess the skills to wield the tool .    do not doubt yourself ,  learning to use it is a joy .   treat yourself
this was a simple and easy to use product .   i didn't even have to read the directions on how to remove the blades .   the only downfall is that you can't use very big vegetables .   i use it to make home made french fries .   i had to cut the potato in order for it to fit in the cutter .   aside from that it's a great product
my wife and i ordered 2 sets of the corelle ware .  we even got a $10 discount automatically .  the order came quicker than expected and everything was in excellent shape .  we like this type of diningware better than china ware .  it is virtually indestructible .  i lkie amazon's free shipping .  i've purchased many things through amazon and haven't been disappointed
i first would like to say that if you are the occasional esspresso drinker ,  then this machine is to costly to use every once in a while go with a cheaper brand .   now for the rest of you that are die hard esspresso drinkers this is the machine for you .i moved from ak to ny a few months ago ,  while i lived in ak  ( alaska )  there were coffe shops on every corner ,  to say the least i was addicted to mochas ,  and moving to ny they are few and far between .   i was going into withdrawl .   after doing some research i found this great machine .   i wanted to use it for a while before writing a review about it .   i love this machine .   this machine is fast and the esspresso is great .   i am a fan of regular esspresso as well and it comes out at a consistanly high quality ,   the crema is perfect ,  however i found if you are using the single shot it doesn't come out that great so always use the double shot .   the machine heats up quickly and everything is provided for you ,  two cups ,  two saucers ,  a pitcher and a frothing attachment .   i can see that this machine will pay for itself withing no time .   i have owned cheaper models in the past and you can really tell the difference in the quality of the esspresso .   i have not used the pod attachment so i can't comment on that .   if you buy the machine in my opinion you wont be disappointed
i am giving this 4 stars rather than 5 simply because i do not like the way this just pulls on and off .  i've never purchased a shaker before though ,  but i would appreciate one the screws off and on so the top is certain to be on every time !  other than that .  . it's very sleek and the strainer in the top is a plus
i'm a true longaberger fan ,  but since they're getting out of control on their prices lately ,  i thought i'd try something else .   this piece by far is the only piece of pottery that i've found that can stand up to longaberger's quality .   this dish cleans beautifully and holds a nice-sized lasagna .   i'm very ,  very happy with it and only wish i'd found the le creuset brand before now .   grab this dish - it will quickly become your favorite !   i love the color
this pan suited my needs exactly .   it's handle is comfortable to hold and it has nice even heat distribution .   the handle and the curve of the outside edge make flipping food quite easy
i got this pan set a few years ago .   i love making checkerboard cakes--they are so simple with this set .   you can use boxed mixes ,  but i find the thicker consistency of the sample recipe makes a more distinct checkerboard design .my favourite variation is to make blue and pink for baby showers instead of brown and white .   ( i make the white cake and just use  food colouring )  .
love this cake plate .  looks like our retro 50s kitchen .  its solid ,  well-formed glass with fluting on the base ,  a nice touch .  and you can't beat the price .  our dinner guests are always excited about desert when they see it displayed so adoringly .  i can't think of a single thing bad about it .  well ,  maybe the cleaning part
this maker is the better of the two pod coffee machines i had .  it is easy to make your own pods that work very well and you have much better coffee due to fresh grind .  my problem was that the part that catches when you close the lid broke .  it probably was mostly my fault but it is made of plastic unlike the metal one on the other pod maker i have .  that is why the other one still works and the juan valdez is broken .  if you are careful not to overfill your homemade pods you'd probably never have a problem with it .  just be careful in closing it and don't force it
the first thing i noticed about this is just how good it looks .   it really is a showpiece in my kitchen .   the smooth ,  rounded shape and the shiny chrome finish really make it look fabulous and i leave it out on the counter all the time .   apart from that ,  it seems pretty much a normal toaster .   the extra-lift feature makes getting small bagels out very easy ,  and the electronic buttons are handy too .   i like the way it can take four big pieces of bread or bagels without taking up too much room in the kitchen .   5 stars
you either  " get "  this product or you don't .   it's probably my favoriteappliance in my whole house ,  and i show it off proudly to everyone whocomes over .   when i do ,  some folks look at me like i'm nuts while othersinstantly begin grinning and nodding their heads .    ( kindred spirits !  )here's the deal .   i hate bending over .   i hate getting my hands dirty witha dustpan .   i don't mind sweeping a room ,  but for some reason that extra stepof scooping up the pile of dirt and dumping it into the trash candrives me crazy .    ( more often than not ,  i'll just sweep the pile into acorner ,  prop the broom against the wall over it ,  and tell myself i'll takecare of it later .   disgusting ,  i know ,  but i'm not exactly known for myhousekeeping skills !  )anway ,  with the sweep-eze ,  all i have to do is sweep the pile under theelectric eye .   magically ,  the machine kicks on and sucks it up--without mehaving to bend over or get my hands dirty or anything .   i love it !i don't have to empty the canister very often ,  maybe once a month at most .the only drawback is that it's pretty loud and my family gets mad at me ifi don't warn them that i'm about to kick it on .   but as long as i say" sweep-eze alert !  "  ,  they're happy .   and it only stays on for a fewseconds anyway .some folks don't get it ,  but for those who do ,  this product is invaluable .i'm not sure how i ever got along without it
this steamer fits perfectly on cuisinart's 4 qt saucepan .   the lid seals in every bit of steam .   i used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn-on-the-cob ,  but since no steam escapes here ,  i can make several batches non-stop .   i also like the fact that the steamer is wide ;  that means that the food will cook evenly  ( instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked )  .   i've only used the steamer five or six times but so far ,  there's practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness ,  but i'm more interested in function than appearance .   washing it immediately will keep it stain-free .   overall ,  an incredible deal for $20 . 00
this product provide a couple of interesting issues .  the first one :  you don't need electricity to make it work on your table  ( no cables on your fancy candle-light-dinner )  ;  the second one :  it works .  all you need is to let it rest in your fridge ,  and that's it
great thing to own and very useful for cooking small quantity of foods .  i use it a lot
i have used this jigger several times a week since i got it back in november ,  and i think it's great .   i often make a second round with it .   it is difficult to remove the top with the jigger on ,  but otherwise it comes off fine as long as you open it up right after you make and pour a round of drinks
although i love the patterns and heft of my 2 collections of stoneware ,  i got very tired of having them chipped and broken by the less  " careful "  members of my family .  although i've had two sets of corelle before ,  and never had any problems with it ,  i never saw patterns that i could live with for very long .  i've gone back to corelle ,  and i think this is it for me .  true ,  the plates are very light ,  but they are so damage resistant--and i can use this pattern for any season
i have 4 of these cookie sheets ,  and am ordering more .   i bake in quantity ,  and these sheets are the only ones i've found that don't warp when heated ,  and that come clean without intense effort .   they also maintain a very consistent heat ,  so that all the cookies on the sheet brown at the same time .
i have seen this set at my friends place  .  .  .  . itsgorgeous !  !  a bid pricy though compared to other corelle sets
i bought the hot diggity dogger many years ago .  we are still using it !  !  my kids have made their own hot dogs for years .  my middle one loves it .  he is getting his own place now and i am going to get him one for christmas .  he has used it the most .  he loves it .  it is the only appliance that i have ever gotten that has truly paid for itself
i have used this filter daily for over a year and love it .  at first i tried using it in a  " mr .  coffee "  style machine ,  but found that my coffee grind was too fine and the water would filter through too slowly and overflow if i made more than 2 cups .since i make coffee for one or two people usually ,  and don't like to leave the coffee on the hot pad ,  so this was okay for me .then i switched to single-cup method using a drip filter holder that fits over the cup .  i bought it along with a cup at a starbucks about 3 years ago .one thing that is great about the swissgold filter is that it cleans so easily .  the first time i rinsed it out i took a paper towel to the inside and it came out clean .  i was very surprised .   ( not so with the plastic filter holder .  )the taste is great ,  and i haven't purchased coffee filters in 3 years .  once i tried it with a coarse grind coffee in my coffemaker ,  which i received as a gift ,  and that worked out okay ,  too .currently i am using it with my caffiene free teeccino herbal coffees  ( help me keep my blood pressure normal under stress )  ,  and the filter works very well with those blends .so i highly recommend it .  it pays for itself if you are looking at it from that aspect .
this is a great shredder .   absolutly the best out there .   it is a lousy slicer .   take the bad with the good i guess .my wife and i shred lots of cheese because pre-shredded cheese has chemicals added that change the taste and chemical properties of the cheese .    this attachment works wonderfully for cheese .a note on disassembly .   some people have difficulty getting the cone off the plug  ( if you own one you know what i'm talking about )  .    the very easy way to remedy this is to remove the cone from the plug before removing the plug from the machine .   if you follow this one rule you will have very easy setup and take down .
not much you would need a food processor for after you buy this  ( ok ,  it can't blend ingredients
i just adore silicone bakeware !  !  !i don't own this particular pan ,  but i'm replying to the first review .  this pan ,  according to the description ,  measures 17-4/5 by 7 & 4/5 by 2 inches .  i'd imagine that the individual loaves would probably measure approximately 8 by 3 & 1/2 inches ,  a good size for ,  for instance ,  zucchini bread loaves intended as christmas gifts
after checking every store i could think of and accepting that i'd have to go online ,  i laughed out-loud when i saw this price !  what was mr .  coffee thinking ?  i read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that i don't even need them !  duh ,  i have filtered water in our house !  thank you mr .   " train man .  "  the little carbon filter sounded like a good idea ,  but my coffee will survive without it .  at least it's not a total loss because i like the coffee maker itself .  happy brewing .
i like this product .  quality is very good .   i use it for other things besides marinating .   store homemade cookies in it ,  left over soups and stews ,  etc .   i am glad i bought it .
these work great to get that extra out of the bowls .  i am very particular about my spatulas .  i love pampered chef items ,  but do not care for their spatulas .  they do not seem to slide very well .  the miu ones slide easily on all surfaces
i love the design ,  and it makes great cake .   everything is evenly browned .   thanks nordicware
i use this pan alot .  it makes great grilled sandwiches ,  pancakes and french toast .  it is also easy to clean and stor
it's a very good cooker .i can save my cooking time .
i am very pleased with this lightweight ,  inexpensive teakettle .  the size is great ;  you can make many cups of tea in a single boil ,  but because the kettle is lightweight ,  it is still manageable with lots of water inside .  trigger button on handle makes pouring easy and burn-free .  i highly recommend this product
this coffee maker is the best i have ever used .   it keeps the coffee hot for 2 hours or more after brewing and it is easy to clean and maintain .   i would recommend this appliance to anyone .
this set conducts heat really well and everything heats up fast but be careful not to burn anything which i did the first time using it .  also it takes a bit of scrubbing if you burn it bt other than that it's a great product
let's face it ,  you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated .   nice furniture and practical book shelves .   but you do not live alone ;  there is probably a canine or feline lurking around .   it may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of garfield on it or some cutesy saying .   but in the long run this durable ,  multi use ,  dishwasher safe ,  bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water .
this stockpot is wonderful !  !  the weight is professional ,  the size perfect and the handles are great for a little old lady like me !  ! ha ha !  what a fabulous buy !  !  thank you !  thank you !  thank you
i was looking for a kettle with a handle that i could pick up without using an oven mitt ,  and one that doesn't require removal of the whistle  ( also with oven mitt of course )  before pouring .   this kettle fit the bill .   the handle as well as the whistle are plastic and cool to the touch .   the whistle flips up with a touch of your thumb and does not require removal .i have been pleasantly surprised by the kettle beyond the two features above  ( which i would have thought would be standard on every kettle ,  but that is so not the case )  .   it looks nice and is sturdily constructed .   the whistle is a gentle reminder ,  not a screaming alarm .   it holds a lot of water ,  enough for about 8 cups of tea plus a little water to rinse out/pre-heat the tea pot with .my only suggestion for improvement is for the handle .   because it's a straight bar across ,  it's not very ergonomic for pouring .   i often find my right wrist at a strange ,  almost uncomfortable angle .   i have solved the problem by using my left hand as well -- first i tilt the kettle with my right hand ,  then i use my left hand to hold the kettle while it's pouring .   i think a curved handle would eliminate this problem
i haven't had a chance to use them yet as the holidays are just approaching ,  but they look good and sturdy .   if the cheesecakes come out well ,  i'll know then ,  but so far ,  so good .   they delivered on time too .
i love this little fan .   it's perfect for cooling one person .   i have it on my nite table and use it every night .   amazingly quiet and soothing air .
just go for new shaped cookies ,  these cutters are great and so simple to use
i love this shelf .  i have two .  you just take it out of the box and the shelves fall into place .  no screwdrivers ,  nothing to assemble .  its fabulous .
this pot rocks .   you'll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it .   it browns well ,  cleans easily ,  and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style .my only complaint is that mine arrived slightly chipped ,  but the chips don't seem to affect its performance ,  so i didn't send it back
i just bought this piece and tried it out .  i love the size and no drip mouth .  . the color is beautiful and its so pretty on my buffet
oxo designs great products and this is no exception .   it does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top .   i just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease .   i liked it so much ,  i bought one for my aunt .before this ,  i made mashed potatoes with a masher ;  the difference is unbelievable .   i kept my masher because i'm a southern girl and sometimes i want lumpy mashed potatoes .this is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher
this baster is big enough to accomplish most tasks ,  and it even makes a great costume accessory on halloween .  except that when i used it as part of my halloween party costume along with a doctor's lab coat and stethoscope ,  all the women blushed and left the room .  oh well ,  maybe next time i'll come as a proctologist
if you are looking for a nice ,  inexpensive set of knives ,  look no further .   this set is very sharp ,  cuts well and fits into your hand nicely .   they have great balance and apperance .   the box is a little cheap feeling and looking ,  but allows for a great storage within a drawer or cabinet .
i am very impressed with the feel and size of this mug .   it has a smooth feel ,  and keeps the coffee/tea hot/warm .   i ordered one ,  but will probably be ordering more !  nice !   : o
this was exactly as described .   inexpensive ,  dense wood cutting board on one side with a nice pastry board on the other .   the wood has an attractive grain that is not out of place on the counter full-time .
this is an outstanding device .  in several i've had before the cutter blades were not fastened to the center piece .  they would flex as the coring progressed and the slices would be rendered a mess .  this corer has rigidly attached blades and therefore cuts clean ,  perfect slices every time
it does the job ,  cook my sushi rice perfectly and no burn .  so much better than my old black and decker
i have this and mini-pans and muffin pans - all silicone .  they are great .  the biggest problem is that the bread tends to expand the sides of the soft pan so the sides are a bit wider .  i never oil the pans and the bread pops out easily .  the muffins too ususally since the recipe often has oil in it .great product .  never noticed any odd taste/smell
i figured  " what the heck "  on this comforter .   similar products at major brick & mortar retailers cost upwards of $100 .   my wife and i have been using it for several months now and are both extremely happy with the quality .   it is soft enough to sleep under without a flat sheet or to drape over ourselves while watching a movie on the couch .   excellent purchase
this makes baking so much easier ,  things just pop right out .   the light weight and noiselessness of the product make this a real winner .   baking just keeps getting easier and easier .   i have replaced all my bakeware possible with these silicone bakeware items .   i love them
i love products that are genuinely high quality goods .   this fan comes under that category .if you are looking to purchase a fan ,  i can recommend this one
i had the same wok for four of the five years that i lived in china .   it was made of the same type of carbon steel as this one .   when i came back to the usa last year ,  i looked all around for this kind of wok and was very happy to find it .my wife ,  a native of southwestern china ,  joined me in the usa this year .   she thoroughly approved of my choice .   and ,  boy ,  does she make the best stir fried vegetables in the world .true ,  it is heavy ,  but that is good news because now we have an electric stove and the thick steel helps distribute the heat well .   ( in china we had a gas stove with a huge flame .  )i still don't understand all the rituals involved with  " seasoning .  "   in china i was taught to scrub it hard after cooking with a stainless steel or brass scrubber in hot soapy water ,  then dry it very well before heating it just a little and rubbing it down with oil  ( we use a paper towel )  on the inner surface .   store it oiled !   rarely have we had any sticking problems .a little scrubbing gets the rust right off if you forget to dry and oil ,  so don't panic !this is a fairly priced  ( at around $25 )  ,  good piece of equipment for cooking  " real "  chinse food
my dish for the holidays is always mini-cheesecakes .   it was always frustrating to get them out of my mini-muffin pan .   this pan has made it so easy !   i no longer dread making this dessert .   just a note though .  .  .  the cups on this pan are approx twice as big as a regular mini-muffin pan so adjust your recipe accordingly .   i just double my recipe and get bigger mini-cheesecakes .   i don't think anyone will mind
we have been using these for several years now .   for refrigerator storage and reheating ,  we use these containers almost daily .   i remember the lids were a bit stiff at first ,  but not impossible unless you are over 80 .after 5 or 6 times through the dishwasher ,  they were prefect and remain so .   they nest nicely and they fit in the dishwasher and come out looking good .   the vent is not that exciting a feature ,  but if it wasn't there you'd have more microwave clanup .regardless ,  i highly recommend these
i love this pitcher it sits on my counter all the time . beatiful cobalt blue color , with white inside , really adds something to creamers , wish  .  .  .  sold the big one i would buy it in a heart beat . great for syrup also
i thought i couldn't live without my cuisinart or kitchen aide - this product goes on the same list !  !  !   this was the easiest ,  best performing kitchen &quot ; gizmo&quot ;  i have ever had .   a must for entertaining and holiday baking - simple ,  easy - no mess !   gone are the days with the &quot ; one at a time&quot ;  with the gas burner !  !   love it ,  love it !  !
we have three dogs so the fur is endless .  i come home from work and start the roomba and voila ,  no more dog hair .  it picks up more stuff than my other vacuums ever did .
they are working well so far .  they stain a little when grease gets on them
this is a great product ,  not only does it boil water fast ,  it is easy to fill and use ,  and pours beautifully
i just moved into my new place and i wanted a new set of dishes that were simple but unique and this set was perfect .   just like past reviews have stated ,  these pieces are a perfect size .   the bowls are awesome cereal bowls ,  the dinner plates are large ,  the salad plates are perfect for salad or a sandwich w/ chips and the coffee cups are used every morning for my cup of joe .   i bought a second set to make sure i had plenty for when friends came over for dinner .   speaking of friends over for dinner ,  on the two occasions that i have had friends over for dinner since i bought the set ,  people always compliment the pieces .   i am very happy with my purchase
very good buy for $85 +free ship .  bought this one to replace a smaller black & decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5-6 years until controls gave out  ( the b&d still works ,  just have to keep the button pressed in )  .i looked at reviews of several toaster ovens before purchasing the t-fal .   the less expensive ones  ( $25-$40 )  were getting dinged because of occasional mentions of overheating or fire risk .   not worth the chance .   i also wanted something as small as possible because we have little counter space in our 10' x 10' kitchen ,  so a more expensive one was not an option .the t-fal gave dimensions on amazon & it was 3 inch wider ,  deeper ,  taller than our b&d .   no big deal - wrong .   it was bigger than i thought when i put it on the counter ,  looked like a monster compared to the b&d .   also ,  i could not open the top warmer lid to the point it stays open .   this because of height restrictions -- bottom of my kitchen cabinet is at about 54 - 60 inches .   i can open the top ,  but i need to hold it open .   my fault ,  not the product or mfr .   but be aware that size matters in a small kitchen .the function buttons are very simple ,  nothing complicated - one button for toast ,  one for bake ,  another for broil .   you can set how long it stays on ,  and it beeps  ( electronically )  three times when it shuts off .   there is a clock ,  but it could be easier to set .i mainly use it to toast bread ,  bagels ,  sandwiches and to bake small pizzas  ( sauce with cheese on a pita - easy )  .   the toast function takes longer than the old b&d  ( about 4 . 5 vs 2 minutes )  ,  but thats ok by me .   the bake function works very well ,  i prefer it muchly over starting the oven to bake something small .clean-up is a snap with a removeable crumb tray ,  glass doors and non-stick surfaces .negatives :  you can pull the rack out about 30-40 percent before it tips forward and burns you .   it's controllable ,  not a big deal ,  unless you don't know about it .   i did know thanks to previous reviews and i was prepared for it .the fan was louder than i expected  ( i expected no noise since the b&d has no fan )  .   but it is a soft sound ,  lower than my computer fan and only on during cooking .overall ,  it's a well built ,  well-designed machine .
don't let the following quirks of this review , fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love . but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that ? life is beautiful , even though i'm a short , ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh . life is beautiful even though i haven't amounted to much in life , except working out the finer intricacies of waitering . i'm a lucky sort of a guy , especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age , sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath - life is beautiful ! i'm a jew , but life can still be beautiful . the nazis put me in a concentration camp , but life is still beautiful . i love my son very much and that's what matters , and that's what makes life beautiful . my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful ? i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love , but hey that's life and that's still a beautiful thing - so by jove don't give me any crap about it ! by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved . well done , there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni . 
wong kar-wei's " fallen angels " is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i've seen in a long while . unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for . ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of " fallen angels " , this is not so . every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at . wong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal " knock off " ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe . ugh . ) the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives . i can't say much more than that as i didn't really know what was going on most of the time . in fact , it wasn't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character . the constantly moving camera doesn't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character . we're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters . " fallen angels " is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level . in fact , i'd go so far as to say that " fallen angels " is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i've ever seen . sure , there's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating . but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images . there were far too many instances during " fallen angels " in which i asked myself , " now who are these people again ? is this that first couple or the second couple ? " it was impossible to keep track . perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with " name cards " , as in scorsese's " mean streets " . that's really besides the point , though . wong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that's he's a movie-maker to watch . let's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies . 
i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture . i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . and i think that lumet's " 12 angry men " , wilder's " witness for the prosecution " and kubrick's " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents . the film is set in burma in 1943 . a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen . struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in " paths of glory " . lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) that means , the picture isn't perfect . but it has a lot of virtues as well . it shows the " madness " of war and what war can produce in people's minds . it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . and " the bridge on the river kwai " is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown . alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . the other actors deliver very good performances as well . jack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

jamaica is a hot vacation spot . the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity . and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica's biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation . life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country . while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface . the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid . it guides the audience along a tourist's journey and the story of the native inhabitants . instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , " you don't see what happens after you flush the toilet . " this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there . this strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film . stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals . this isn't just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life . people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country . the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not . of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank . officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica's economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word . the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens . admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument . but jamaica isn't against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief . if anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations . 
" gattaca " represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it's a genre picture that doesn't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they'd like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . those made the old-fashioned way are labeled as " in-valids " and confined to the lower rung of society . vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . fed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . everyday , he watches as " superior " folk make his fantasy a reality . determined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . for a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . because of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she's enamored by his flawless persona she doesn't know is a lie . but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . two ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate's loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent's eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent's cover and derail his goal . even if " gattaca " were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film's look is dazzling without ever being flashy . first-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama " the truman show " ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . an opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . niccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . when it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . ethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting's clinical chill . as the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it's his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . in " gattaca " 's series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view . the big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . still , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it's successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it's a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it's a futuristic fable without blood and guts . even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . although it's portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , " gattaca " serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . 
" footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . as mentioned at the beginning of this review , " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . so why did i enjoy it so much ? for one thing , the cast is great . kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort . yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be . and he never broods . the rest of the cast is equally impressive . john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . another nice touch is the music . we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with " sexual innuendos " , but that's not true at all . the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun . during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing . of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . anyway , " footloose " is a charming little surprise . don't let the premise prevent you from watching it . it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you . 
more than forty years ago , the " sword and sandals " genre of historical epic ruled the box office . during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . " ben-hur . " " cleopatra . " " the robe . " " sparticus . " " the fall of the roman empire . " " quo vadis . " sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( " the last emperor , " " braveheart " ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( " roots , " " shogun " ) . yet , the phrase " we who are about to die salute you " has been absent until now . " gladiator " begins in germania in a . d . 180 . roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . ) an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds . proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . the similarities to " braveheart " are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . also , like mel gibson's epic , " gladiator " has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger . it's a simple tale of good versus evil . maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . " gladiator " is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a " chick flick " be a " dick flick " ? ) . there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride . throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil . i've been a russell crowe fan since " romper stomper . " this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in " l . a . confidential " and " the insider " -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . my only major quibble with " gladiator " is its stylized look . several scenes are tinted . we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in " payback " and " the matrix . " i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . in " payback " it was merely annoying , but in " gladiator " it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic . ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) with a more realistic look , " gladiator " could be even more satisfying than " braveheart " because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . 
robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends . stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest . reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain . with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze . luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony . twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot . it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days . the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber . however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable . the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn . stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher . there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe . it's a minor , but irritating , flaw . with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight . it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time . at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package . still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two . 
after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel's wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . she is often the target of her father's frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . her self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel's wedding unfolds from there . toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . muriel's father , bill " the battler " heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . while chumming around with young fans and crowing 'you can't beat progress' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel's cheeky new friend in the film . she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . muriel's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan's scripting muriel's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . hogan's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . hogan's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . muriel's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . on my four star scale , i give muriel's wedding three stars . 
my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance ( or a movie that we've all seen a million times ) , two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins . this is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . this movie was exceptional for many reasons . one being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly , one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i'll let you fiqure which is which ) . also , they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) . experience counts for a lot ! ! 
why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike . hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience . the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . it's very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . " the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon . the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) . dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years . a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack . " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . when you get right down to it , " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which " the iron giant " has in spades . 
steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and " oscar " -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list . however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . together with other young directors of his " new hollywood " generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of " blockubuster " philosophy . but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book " ufo experience " by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - " close encounters " - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for " oscar " as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie . apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . according to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . so , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . the result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . anyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema . 
note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s . things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) . she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( " $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn " ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel " rum punch " ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . mr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment . with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next . 
roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence . he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government . instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter . guido wins dora . they marry . fast forward about five years . guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list . true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . the winner takes home a tank . therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . throughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way . ultimately , the allies rescue the camp . in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . the price for his victory is most high . benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . those who object to it are missing its point . and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 
" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred " . a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off . but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film . what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative . screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called " suspiria de profundis " . the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho . it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own . though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well . several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive . the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . and the soundtrack ? it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding . apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience . even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen . and the colours ! deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror . 
one year has passed since the last time we saw them , and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but , they've moved out of their parents homes , and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse . wayne's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend , cassandra , and of course garth is still having his own , personal growing pains . they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film . again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra's talent can bring in . the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original , " guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back . " fortunately , there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot . the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color . highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth's seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960's batman setup in the guy's pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some " naked indian guy , " an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at . and if you've ever wondered why there's always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you'll find out here . this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more . garth has somewhat of a " coming of age " and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend , jim morrison ) . a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again , but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh , and luckily , few , if any of them are overused . overall , the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandra's dad ) , but these are easily overlooked as this is , after wayne's world . the plot is flimsy but manageable . there are a few special effects , but they are fairly seamless , and fill nicely into the plot . the acting is good , for this sort of movie , but there are some very bright spots . in the big picture , this movie is just plain fun . there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special . during the whole one hour and 40 minutes , i didn't even think about looking at my watch a single time . silly , but riotous at times , this is an excellent movie even better than the original . 
what if one of our cities became the target for terror ? what can we do ? what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ? what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ? so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world . it is the land of opportunities . it is the land of freedom . but what if it became the new target ? this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality . when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice . the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : " release him . " then all hell breaks loose in new york . a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians . a broadway theater is bombed . hostages are taken at a school . as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law . devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil . another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities . his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o ! f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies . hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal . but the attacks escalate . the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy . the land is under siege . they have lost control . . a terror is coming from within . . what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life . it reflects reality . and that's why it makes such an impact . edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season . the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously . and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective . he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) . he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved . the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii . there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the " greater good . " in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom . was that what the terror ! ists really wanted ? this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially . but to me these protests seem unnecessary . zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys . the script is therefore wonderfully balanced . agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american . and it is quite often you hear lines such as " my first boyfriend was palestinian . they seduce you with their suffering " or " they love this country as much as we do . " but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority . more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military . and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! way . denzel washington is dashing as always . in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual . anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . . bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand . the film is elegantly shaped . the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong . zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism . he tightens the intensity as the events progress . and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising . it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich . nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values . it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey . it has courage enough to get involved in politics . it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense . i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down . but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of . " this is the u . s . army . it's a broadsword , not a scalpel . believe me , you do not want us in an american city " - gen . william devereaux , " the siege " 
every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside . apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) . her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall . however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo . as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing . but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a " sensation " at court . in one of the film's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance . it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in " sensations , " an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity . the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . 
glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . like private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power . in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . it makes your blood boil . the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends . searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him " snow flake . " the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . they are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . broderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . unfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . in an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . to the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it's just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of " thirtysomething " ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . in one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . a couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . the regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . like any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north's victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . 
quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie . he runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain . eventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal . since he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it . their scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money . instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl . of course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time . you could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined . dennis quaid makes a fine hero . pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them . dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl . but lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is . connery's voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon . so , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie . if you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script . 
_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction . if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority ! first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ? well , yes ? and no . it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems . when i saw the first trailer for " titanic " , it was when i went to see " bean " last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect . it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much . did i ? yes and no . mainly yes , i'm happy to say . the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the " human " aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course ! : - ) ) . well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . does it work here ? in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story . what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's " rescuing " rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable . there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending . which leads us to the second half of the film . we all knew it was coming . i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . and it is an hour . my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ? gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of " entertainment " in other films . but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . not that i'd expect the word " understatement " to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as " terminator 2 " and " aliens " ) . is it overdone ? i thought so . understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half . still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . haven't mentioned the script . plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything . as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . it's a period drama . but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . did they really use phrases like " goddamn it ! " back in the turn of the century ? i doubt it . would someone talk like this : " do ya love the guy or what ? " . i doubt it . is such dialogue as " i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now " not just a bit ? clumsy ? yes it is . a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . stick with directing , dude . but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? ! after all , they were throwing oscars at " titanic " left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job . like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score . utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! ; - ) i've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? hell , don't talk to me about oscars . bloomin' farce . it was deserving in a number of departments , though . last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? nope , i don't think so . it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . and as for the fact they're reportedly making a " titanic 2 " ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you ! 
you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade . two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities . nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence . ephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple . ryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble ) . their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots . for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn . yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan . and the two are kept busy . one , the other or both are in nearly every scene . hanks has his decent guy routine down pat , yet each time he does it , it seems effortless , spontaneous and fresh . ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable , with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew . their scenes together sparkle , even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle . and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe . the sparks created by the earlier movie are , by necessity , not evident here . true , these are two people seeking true love , but you've got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor . the ephrons' script is witty and sharp . however , as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven . some scenes drag , while others , especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail , are crisp and tidy . also , the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story . a nice , romantic soundtrack adds to this date-night special . overall , you've got mail is a lush and cute outing , taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads . it's a nice holiday movie , one for holding hands and snuggling . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 
" being john malkovich " is the type of film we need to see more . today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes . malkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur . this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable . john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time . his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment . when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk . when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor . it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time . meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her . the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever . the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream . being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies . i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery . in my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant . it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you . it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue . even if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing . it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion . it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed . other than that , i had a very enjoyable time . the acting was quite delightful as well . john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well . he's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i'm hoping that will change . cameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off . john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice . who else's mind would be better to explore ? the director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings really catches my attention with this project . i knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme . he too is likely too receive media attention . " being john malkovich " isn't an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite . what's even better is the film's puzzling message . . . am i nick lyons ? 
one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap . but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent . boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along . mark whalberg , a . k . a marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area . jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies . in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script . we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband . but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up . there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches . the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . ) boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) the soundtrack is also excellent . like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift . also , the costumes are great . the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . the film , although excellent , does have some flaws . firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry . in both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost . but the rest of the cast are excellent . burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly . it's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . but they're small niggles really . boogie nights is an excellent film . superb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film . whatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights . 
maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively . because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great . underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way . it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point . it goes from character to character . it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship . it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike " patch adams , " effortlessly emotional and real . in short , this movie is just awesome . it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers . director anand tucker tells this story well . he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real . the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends . they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two . jackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned . when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) . they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone . she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure . it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar " shine " in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way . the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized . their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another . when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) . and the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance . i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job . the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in " beloved " : sure , she's good , but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ? hell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . in that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother's lover is scared off . she has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about . but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . if you don't believe me , look at jack nicholson's performance in " as good as it gets " : great performance , but easy job . this isn't so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point . and thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . rachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson's protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her . griffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from " breaking the waves " and " the boxer " ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who've already deemed watson's performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she's the one who doesn't get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . after all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in " rainman " ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) . she does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it's griffiths . together , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven't been seen this year . if it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . it's so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it's nearly a shame that it's not the flawless gem that it should be . but , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain . 
i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco . however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films . i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy . i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available . director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s . this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics . this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story . one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete . in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette . burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner . horner's has a steady " family " of performers , some of whom live in his plush l . a . home . but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better . when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . 's hardcore film scene . but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . boogie nights is not about sex . it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all . pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . first stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . second stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . his alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . horner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her " babies " provides some of the films most poignant scenes . clearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . but the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . then again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . eddie adams , who later takes on the screen name " dirk diggler " , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . i say " former " pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . this is bold and brave territory for such a young man . he pulls it off marvelously . wahlberg is a " big , bright star " with a big bright future . boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . its intimate studies of character make it the superior film . wahlberg's surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson's . but in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . i got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . still , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya know , kinda like disco . 
it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie . the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . it is filled with above-the-title stars . the cast , for the most part , gives great performances . john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance . one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration . the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic . these actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick . terrence malick is a cinematic legend . he has often been called " the j . d . salinger of cinema . " his two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures . after he made them , he disappeared for 20 years . this film marks his return . what he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment . the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as " i'm scared . " the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted . the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill . a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured . many stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going . the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault . it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table . this basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed . i'm not declaring that the film has no structure . while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat . the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking . the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice . this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video . ultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them . the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature . while some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish . after seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again . 
not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces . and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . all that is missing is a discussion of god . which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms . once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any " style " at all . whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . there are a few missteps . for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . needless to say , it is also very depressing at times . but for many of us , of course , so is life . and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better . 
many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward . most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors . but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust . . . one member even had to be awakened after the film ended . don't believe the previews that you see . . . this is definitely not a film for everyone . this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years . kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline . the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us . it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries . think of the film city of angels . now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision . both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back . but due to it's story , i doubt it will . for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well . but don't get me wrong . . . i hope the film does do well . it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind . what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals . the only film that surpasses it is dark city . full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell . what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake . chris " christy " nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married . annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic . chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) . but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie . she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution . chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that . just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim . chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather . guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy . that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie . prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt . chris decides to leave her alone . little does he realize what will happen next . i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) . certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews . story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife . however , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil . a couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life . " we're soul mates ! " chris exclaims . heaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love . usually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds . but what dreams may come goes a different route . it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before . chris' heaven is his memories brought to life . his thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven . " i've never seen anyone use real paint before , " albert says . equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone . instead , it's a state of being . in one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his " tracker " ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces . thousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else . mostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood . it's truly a frightening sequence . production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination . using state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration . sometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact . it's not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it . costume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes . cinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects . but serra's entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job . writer ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot . the story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning . and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision . what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience . your average movie goer more than likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques . the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn't take it too far . it is , after all , just a movie . robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering . his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn't quite as effective . but drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here . it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did . the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land . this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention . it's also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination . however , the academy doesn't like to award performances for these types of films . cuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he's certainly not distracting . max von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock . a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris' father lost in the sea of faces . it's not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images . overall , it's williams and sciorra's film . what dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity . the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience . some will find the plot distracting . some will find the visuals absolutely glorious . and some will find both . the only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . by the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( " what " becomes " wet " and you should understand ) . in actuality , the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet . just thought i should let you know . 
well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it ! daylight is a great disaster movie . if you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character already . a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ) stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion . then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom ! >from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged . most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat . there are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well . there is no general antagonist in this film , but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that . daylight is a great film , i saw a non-matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny . the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters . rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film . 
ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , " welcome back kotter . " always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole . " so , " you ask , " where is he now ? " mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker . that's right . i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time . and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . you silly goose . well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life . but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . sorry about the segue , or lack thereof . matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play . mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all . there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth . john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky . while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen . she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead . a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor . the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . one game in a cigar club had me in stitches . " i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , " says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on . the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . wait ! as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . hang on ! packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . okay , i guess that's enough . oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother . 
what is a scary movie anyhow ? is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters . movies like " halloween " and " psycho " which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled " the exorcist " , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 " the exorcist " comes back to the big screen in a version you've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending . chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan . while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden . when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter . father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl . christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl . excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death . now we get to the experience " the exorcist " the way it was meant to be seen in a director's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more . the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing . the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness . as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is " the exorcist " nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on . ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in " requiem for a dream " to which she is getting rave reviews for . jason miller ( jason patrik's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along . i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff ! anyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going . hopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .

logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . occasionally , we get a film that does manage it . terry gilliam's " 12 monkeys " was one such film . but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all . there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? the " terminator " films made up for them with exciting action , " back to the future " did it with an entertaining story , and the new film " frequency " pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . is " frequency " filled with plot holes ? yes . does it matter ? not really . the film opens in october of 1969 . firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day . though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . the premise of " frequency " is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it . when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point . when " frequency " gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and " frequency " works as long as it keeps moving . the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure " frequency " as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film . there are enough surprises and plot twists in " frequency " to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . the other major thing to appreciate about " frequency " is the handling of the father-son relationship . quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors . the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot . here , we do care , because we like the lead actors . i also liked some of the supporting cast members . elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . andre braugher , late of the television show " homicide : life on the street , " gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john . he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes . braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . perhaps the only thing i didn't like about " frequency " is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . but that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . i freely acknowledge that " frequency " may best work as a " guy " movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of " field of dreams " can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . who wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ? or see how their children turn out ? " tell me about your life , son " -- excuse me while i mist up . and don't call me a sissy . 
" i know what you did last summer , " the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996's " scream , " and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997's biggest hit of the fall season . while " scream " was a more knowing film about the genre , " i know what you did last summer " is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the " friday the 13th " films ( well , okay , " jason goes to hell " was pure hell to sit through ) . the film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . it is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways . kind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player . when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home . distraught and confused , they decide they can't go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him . julie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry . switch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out . almost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , " i know what you did last summer , " and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook . " i know what you did last summer , " is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . the characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . and last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family's store with the killer inside with her . perhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . heche's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . " i know what you did last summer , " could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . prinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . also , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . luckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted " jump-in-your-seat " scare . in the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i've ever heard . she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best " scream queen . " and gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered . although not up to the level of either " scream " movies , or the more recent , " urban legend , " " i know what you did last summer " is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made . 
on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director . reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf . here's what the two movies do have in common . . . --scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three . crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist . the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated . instead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr . white ( keitel ) , mr . pink ( buscemi ) , mr . orange ( roth ) , mr . blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr . brown ( tarantino ) and mr . peach ( tarantino's chin ) . most of the movie's running time is spent with mr . white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive . mr . orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound . the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant . the story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks , of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime . eventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene . let's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear . a lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie , but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino . the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna's " like a virgin . " another scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana . neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie . reservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction . 
bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one . the screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner . anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration . the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one . bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so . a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye . after confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie . but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project . kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge . the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage . the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him . when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes . these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen . certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny . no , hilarious . standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) . and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas . while the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script . however , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy . this is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's . murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it . this is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules . but it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season . the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits . the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top . graham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay . i wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough . 
why do people hate the spice girls ? ? what exactly have they done wrong , other than perhaps offend the fashion police ? ? so what if they are not " great " singers---they ain't singing opera , folks , its pop music ! ? who exactly is a " great " singer ? judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls . ? they do what they do--sing some catchy tunes--and they do it pretty well . ? they are able to carry that into their first film , " spice world " . ? " spice world " certainly isn't a great filmgoing experience . . . what it is what the spice girls are all about : fun , songs , and a lot of " girl power ! " drawing from a number of different films ( like the beatles' " hard day's night " ) " spice world " chronicles the week heading up to the girls' first concert at london's albert hall . ? they get to tool around london in a big ol' bus ( driven by meat loaf ! ) and generally have fun . ? in order to through a semblence of plot into the film , there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries , better known to americans , for about 15 minutes , as dame edna ( remember her ? ) ? he wants to sabotage the girls' concert so he can sell papers . of course , the point in a movie like " spice world " isn't plot . ? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves : ginger ( the recently departed geri haliwell ) , posh ( victoria adams ) , sporty ( melanie chisolm ) , scary ( melanie brown ) , and baby ( emma bunton ) . ? each one has their own personality and , perhaps the best part of the film , look like they are having some honest-to-goodness fun , something that can't be said for a lot of people in films today . along for the ride are richard e . grant as their manager , clifford , and various other characters making quick cameo appearances ( including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry ) . ? and , every once and a while , roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans ( added bonus : he gets to , in the words of craig kilborn , dance , dance , dance . ) watching this film was fun , for the most part . ? there are a few slow segments , but overly , director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace , with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background . ? his camerawork is fairly pedestrian , though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing . ? the look of the film promotes the high fun , with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eye-catching . ? add in wall-to-wall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp . ? if you don't like the spice girls , you won't change your mind with this film . ? but , if you find them at least tolerable , get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you . . . and do it quite well . ?

earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . a real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing . the plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland . ned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael . jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . the two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience . every viewer is sure to like both of them . there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary . overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . the ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout . the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff . in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial . it's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes . there's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . indeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss . 
i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . this one , however , is shockingly not bad . in fact , it's actually good . not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . because it's cute and innocent fun . because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . because the lead star is immensely appealing . because the parents are also immensely appealing . and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun . there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's " wonderful world of disney , " where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like " lady and the tramp " and " pinnochio " ) . and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing . i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv " parent trap ii " on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original " parent trap . " it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it . i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age . watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way . it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right . the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's " the seven samurai " : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer . she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . there , they become friends , then learn about eachother . once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of . they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in " pulp fiction " ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . but she comes off just as appealing as she did once . she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect . she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan . ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) . the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . this all brings this new " parent trap " to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : " it takes two " starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . 
apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . if they ever reach it . ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . you should enjoy it . 
perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits . i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) . in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision . i can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . out of sight proves that it doesn't . i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . it's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . he's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . i can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . the supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames . dennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . steve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . out of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . not every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . as for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at . 
synopsis : retiring detective jerry black ( nicholson ) becomes involved in the case of a murdered girl , and promises her parents that he will find the killer . he purchases a gas station on a route he believes the killer takes , and there befriends lori ( wright penn ) and her young daughter . as jerry and lori fall in love , can he do what must be done to fulfill his pledge ? review : at first , " the pledge " appears to be just another standard , if well-executed , crime drama . it is anything but ; in its final hour , it turns the corner and becomes a riveting , terrifying study of its lead character , jerry black . penn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre , but they are just window dressing . his interest here , unequivocally , is jerry , a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes the entirety of the his existence . at first , we see this only in small hints ; some of his habits change , for instance , and he suddenly takes up smoking in a big way . but then , when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori , the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus . nicholson is fantastic , portraying black with rare subtlety and animus ; jerry's gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck , a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from . penn coaxes good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast , too . only eckhart disappoints as jerry's replacement , stan ; he never seems entirely convincing , too much a tool of the plot . penn's direction is astounding , each frame looking as though it is parched -- of water , perhaps , or of sanity . it all builds up to a shattering , devastating climax which lingers uncomfortably in the mind long after the house lights have come up . 
meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes & twisters ! summer is here again ! this season could probably be the most ambitious = season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact , = godzilla , the x-files , armageddon , the truman show , all of which has but = one main aim , to rock the box office . leading the pack this summer is = deep impact , one of the first few film releases from the = spielberg-katzenberg-geffen's dreamworks production company . following = the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases ; mousehunt and = amistad , deep impact shines with elements which could just make it one = of the biggest movies of the year . deep impact begins with the discovery of an earth bound comet during a = school astronomy outing by leo beiderman ( elijah wood ) which = subsequently stirred up the political community of the world . keeping = the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic , president beck = ( morgan freeman ) took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute a = highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits = earth . while pursuing a sex-scandal story amongst the presidential = ranks , ambitious up and coming reporter , jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) = unfolds the wool that president beck has pulled over the citizens of the = world . as if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is = not enough , jenny has to come to terms with her father ( maximillian = schell ) leaving the mother for a younger woman . =20 president beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the = comet exactly one-year later , with so much confidence that it left no = trace of panic within the american community . achieving fame from = announcement of the comet wolf-beiderman en-route to earth ( the name of = its discoverers ) , leo beiderman continues life in his small town as a = young celebrity . a team of astronauts , led by the ageing veteran = astronaut spurgeon tanner ( robert duvall ) , was secretly trained to carry = out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with a = nuclear device , with the hope of blowing it out of its current path = towards earth . despite him being the most experienced in the team , the = younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts tanner's ability due = to his age . but these are just problems of individuals . life on earth = goes on as any other day , confident that the comet will be destroyed . when the attempt to avert wolf-beiderman's path failed and caused the = comet to split into two : comet wolf and comet beiderman , the president = unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population , leaving = the rest to die . citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for 2 = years prior to impact , when the dust due to the impact around earth have = settled , by then all life on the surface would have died . jenny and leo = were picked but many of their loved ones were not , only a handful of = earth's population will be saved from destruction . =20 deep impact's moving moments occur in the least special-effect laced = scenes . while the effects are fantastic , they only form a small part of = the film , which indulges itself in the development of its main = characters ; leo , lerner and tanner . leo's struggle when he learns that = his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved , lerner's = dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mother's = loneliness , tanner's strive to gain the respect he deserves from his = crew and his ultimate sacrifice , all form the backbone of deep impact's = moving moments . deep impact smells suspiciously like the previous year = release contact despite vivid differences . i think its probably because = they both delve in a story of global proportions and indulges in the = premise of hope , faith and life itself . both do not depend heavily on = eye-candy in the form of cgi effects . director mimi leder ( who won = numerous awards directing television series , and made her debut with = peacekeeper last year ) is definitely a director to watch . =20 despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer ( the = other being armageddon ) , i think there will be stark differences in the = approach to the subject matter . while the premise of both may be the = same , execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep = impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon , which is done = by the team which brought us bad boys , crimson tide and the rock . =20 deep impact should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences ; from the = most action-craving to those who just want to immerse into its = manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise . 
an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material . the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation . instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days . of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries . in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) . rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando . i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips . but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread . ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world . throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character . the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up . director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor . the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job . the reason ? mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories . the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny . unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone . rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt . it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie . several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies . early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door . after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past . it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any . but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips . the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . . or if our passports weren't missing . 
anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . anna function is to help provide that link . the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . it shows a seduction of intelligence . ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . 
in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment . like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle . and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie . will is a troubled individual . as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards . then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . will flees , but lambeau tracks him down . unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . and , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a " taster's choice moment . " later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship . many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the " good " in the title . 
like the wonderful 1990 drama , " awakenings , " starring robin williams and robert de niro , " at first sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight , " directed by irwin winkler , is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks . since " awakenings " was so very good , and made my top ten list the year it was released , " at first sight " is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . at the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . amy doesn't really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . once she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil's certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil's sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . at first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . ultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . he moves into amy's apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . on the basis of the overall story , " at first sight " is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , " awakenings . " what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . however , what helps " at first sight " rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer " you've got mail " immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual " love scenes , " and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the " big city . " the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . val kilmer , usually cast in the " macho " type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , " mighty aphrodite , " for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's " mimic , " 1998's " the replacement killers " ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with " at first sight " that she finally has another juicy role to play . in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the " bad , " one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . the one misstep of " at first sight " is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . in " awakenings , " the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , " at first sight " comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . 
swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults . steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie . and he knows a money making winner when he sees one . the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster . hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro . a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife . the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead . however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . banderas motive ? to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie . with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease . hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work . as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . the audience does hate them , which can't be bad . catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance . the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones . there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together . the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly . the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well . the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding . although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment . however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed . it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script . although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent . there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together . the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off . this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going . in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades . it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account . you won't regret it . 
" take a number , fill out a form , and wait your turn . " starring kati outinen , kari v ? ? n ? nen , sakari kuosmanen , elina salo ; written & directed by aki kaurism ? ki ; cinematography by timo salminen it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone . it is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward . he loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays . within a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced . a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation . lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv , which she greets with little enthusiasm . she notes that they haven't finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet . he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves . it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn't spoken with such resigned weariness . this sets the tone for the rest of the movie . there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity . there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters . lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion . they go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l'atalante and l'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy . their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances . the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment . there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love . their downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel . it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film's great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona's misfortunes . irony would be an injustice . situations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted . the emotions are authentic . if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that's because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered . he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife's former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money . all this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious . if most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear . but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length . i have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not . it does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing . it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one . there is no selling point . it is all understatement , restraint , melancholy . the characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills . this does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore . it engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending . the only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters' lives is their refusal to give in to despair . their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a " feel-good " ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned . 
towards the middle of " the sweet hereafter , " a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight . then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field . it pauses for a moment before the " field " cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time . compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of " titanic , " when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films . the scene in " the sweet hereafter " epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film . it's not sensational . we don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about . the bus doesn't explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces . it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake . it's a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance . using a non-linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy . fourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief . the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit . stephens , who " doesn't believe in accidents , " functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath . while stephens' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss . his self-destructive , drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years . egoyan's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry . mychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for " the ice storm , " contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles . equally impressive is paul sarossy's cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room . " the sweet hereafter , " while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go . it's a film of generous subtlety and emotion . 
just how inseparable is the team of sgt . martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt . roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ? let's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it ! the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye . new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective . trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception . even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship . we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen . gunfire ensues , and when it's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord . although they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action . and there's plenty of action here for two movies . led by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to . li is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives . there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore . it's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun . but even too many explosions can get boring . to counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li . luckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns . meanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets . everybody gets in on the shtick . russo screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones . gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano . score one for the old guard . 
ingredients : lost parrot trying to get home , friends synopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility .

" sometimes , however , there are statements the kids don't get . for example , when paulie's elderly owner ivy ( gena rowlands ) dies , paulie explains , " well , one day , the cat got her . " and you hear kids exclaim , " what cat ? ! " imagine lassie come home , except with a doll-sized human dressed as a bird , and you'll have a good idea of the plot and characterization . bird tries to get home . bird meets elderly friend . bird loses elderly friend . bird meets eccentric friend . bird loses eccentric friend . bird meets bad influence . and so on and so forth , with paulie meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie ( trini alvarado ) . the bottom line ? break out the popcorn money , moms and dads . paulie may be the low end version of lassie , bambi , or babe , but he'll do . sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads , but i'm sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person ( paulie ) trying to get home , meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way . and good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy , " well , one day , the cat got her . " 
the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in " absolutely fabulous " ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs ! but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that " hobbling " scene was no less disturbing ! i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching . stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's " number one fan " , he soon becomes her prisoner . both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary ! this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema . there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . along with the pig , of course ! anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . he succeeds , but . . . she knocks the glass over ! i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - " d'oh ! ! " other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ? ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! boy , do they work ! if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right ! of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned " hobbling " ! annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all . cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! nasty . it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen . she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die ! sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either . if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable . but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . wonderful stuff . ? - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly-updated film and tv reviews , check out my site ! http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/bungalow/4960 - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - 
warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film " fail-safe . " if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution . nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . -------------------- " fail-safe " ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side . in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . this is the theme of sidney lumet's " fail-safe , " a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . " fail-safe " takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . a great deal of " fail-safe " 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost . the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . the events in " fail-safe " are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason " fail-safe " works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it . most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of " strategy " in a nuclear assault to " minimize " casualties . " what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? " a guest asks impatiently . " forty million , " groeteschele responds wryly . the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended . on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . " fail-safe " clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? is it wise ? is it even logical ? no , not really . although " fail-safe " is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . in addition to providing the central " pro-nuclear war " voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . one of groeteschele's " logical " trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd . he labels the average marxist an " unfeeling , calculating machine " that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing . he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear " incident " can probably be . ) it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences . dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic " matador " ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate . " fail-safe " is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that " fail-safe " also finds dangerous . in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . 
the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's . more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film . alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's . ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . to reveal any more of the story would be unfair . suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul . the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences . and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential . 
apocalypse now , based on the novel " hearts of darkness " , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle . a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film . in many ways , this debate could go either way . apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made . in addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years . apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l . willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e . kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia . captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with " extreme prejudice " because he has been deemed a murderer . willard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation . accusing someone of murder in this situation is like " handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 " , as he puts it . it doesn't make too much sense . escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat . the men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr . clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne ) . willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big . the men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations . but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore . kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf . surf . this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson . duvall's portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific , and , he provides a number of memorable quotes . eventually , captain willard encounters colonel kurtz's frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look , especially his followers . one of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard . but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony . kurtz is actually well aware of willard's mission , and refers to him as " an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill " . yet willard is intent on completing his mission , no matter what shocking things kurtz does . apocalypse now , possibly one of the greatest films ever made , is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war . a movie that will hypnotize you with it's brilliant cinematography , apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war . definitely on the " do not miss " list . be prepared for a very memorable film . 
in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success . little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film . in january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves . other than these , the film is exactly the same . why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it . the plot is basic but in the same way , complex . it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . he and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . the film is obviously quite star-studded . but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? it just happened to work out for him . the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . , 
plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention . the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road . who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie . critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year ! it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around . a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff . it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop . this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments . in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim . but the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . i guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here . in the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards . and smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks ! there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time . the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next . it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works . the film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse . i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well . and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? no . . . okay , well i just did ! i coulda done without her whole " romance " angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods . try to see how many " inside " connections to the king you can guess . of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind . i also like these types of " guy " movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots . probably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure . now see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below . the elvis songs also recommend this movie ! so whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender . i really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender . and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either . so don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film . it's now or never , folks . trust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me . joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building . thank you . . . thank you very much ! ! where's joblo coming from ? get carter ( 7/10 ) - heat ( 8/10 ) - honeymoon in vegas ( 9/10 ) - payback ( 8/10 ) - reindeer games ( 5/10 ) -reservoir dogs ( 9/10 ) - way of the gun ( 6/10 ) 
felix ( sami bouajila , " the siege " ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france . when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in " the adventures of felix . " writers/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy " jeanne and the perfect guy , " embracing that typically american genre . their second effort , " the adventures of felix , " once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself . felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends . when he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away . felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of " cocktails " for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot . he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny . along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations . on the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police . following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family . his journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , " my little brother , " where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix . they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on . he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled " my grandmother , " and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to . she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father . in the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled " my cousin , " he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles . he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled " my sister . " he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would . on the final leg of the journey titled " my father , " he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son . " the adventures of felix " has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery . first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix . he is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of " cocktails , " and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself . as he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally . bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen . the cast of characters making up felix's new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way . patachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix . ariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had . only the " cousin " chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix's " family . " " the adventures of felix " does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning . it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside . i give it a b+ . 
stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's . based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . it's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . this is a long welcome reunion . if the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career . * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web . 
i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one , folks . i loved the wedding singer . but it gets worse . if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence . . . hell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i'm bound to be lynched . well lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception . right away , you're ready to discount my review , aren't you ? you're thinking that i can't possibly know what i'm talking about . after all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ? well , there's more . . . i actually got choked up , and more than once . yes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes . but before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself . the wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so . but when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn't exist for people like him . in the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character . julia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the " miami vice " loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn't seem all that interested . as the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he's merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women . it's obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her , but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ? this isn't sleepless in seattle , but i'd actually compare it to that before i'd compare it to happy gilmore . while the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor , its sincerity and charm carry it a very , very long way . sandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously . barrymore seems perfect along side him , and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) , the two go together like bread and butter as a mid-eighties couple . one scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears . unfortunately , sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no-brainer , but it's got so much surprise substance packed inside that i'm encouraging everyone to go see it . in fact , the entire theater applauded when the film ended , and laughs were so consistent , some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar . the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth , and for those of us that are old enough to remember it , it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well ) . sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? ) . while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit , grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars . it's hilarious , and it's touching . it's got that great cheezy humor , but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected . this is one to see again and again . is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 ? my " magic 8-ball " predicts it is certain . 
steven spielberg's " amistad , " which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who " owned " them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . " amistad " succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another " anti-slavery " movie . having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it . fortunately , i turned out to be wrong . for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so " amistad " was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their " excess " slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . the biggest success of " amistad " is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . " what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? " he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room . still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem . the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . " amistad " tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . perhaps the best way to describe it is this : " amistad " is three four star films edited into one . almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . 
synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . there is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . within the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . preserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . manipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a " phantom " menace . jedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala's home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . on the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . the five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . can they free amidala's helpless planet ? opinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace's greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . does phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? director george lucas answers , " it's only a movie . " to me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . visually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . it is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera . at least this much is clear : there's plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it's good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . weaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . at first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . this dilutes the central story . additionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . veteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . better ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . strengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . the film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . bottom line ? seeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . we are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months .

" featuring the voice talents of matt stone , trey parker , mary kay bergman . rated r . filmmakers jump on real-life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell . the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up , and already someone's made a movie about it , and it's not , thank god , a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy . instead we get a sharp , biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed . based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights . the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r-rated movie and learn some naughty words . when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to " blame canada , " wage war against the neighbor country and execute " terrence and phillip , " the flatulent actors in the obscene film . the kids form an alliance they name " la resistance " ( with the accent on the third syllable of " resistance " ) to save their favorite thespians , in a hilarious spoof of ( tribute to ? ) les mis ? rables . in a subplot , one of the characters ( kenny , who else ? ) dies and goes to hell where he meets satan . satan and saddam hussein are lovers , you see . satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex . apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth . aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all-stops-out musical , with unforgettable numbers like " shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er " and " cartman's mom is a big fat bitch " . almost invariably it's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny . the same can be said for the rest of the movie : it's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner ( i . e . toilet humor , endless profanity , etc . ) . not that there's anything wrong with that : vulgarity , when done right , is my bag , baby . trey parker and matt stone , the twenty-somethings behind the film and the show , paint a bulls-eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it . cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren't uttered , the auteurs throw some nasty one-liner insults their way . the ratings-a-plenty association isn't the only target of this unsparing banter : people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game , with the " blame canada " plot being a not-so-cheap shot at them . the distinctively low-tech " cardboard " animation is oddly effective , even more so than the state of the art " deep canvas " technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan . it's more pleasant to look at , less intimidating up on the screen , and most importantly it doesn't detract from the film's concept as much as disney's admirably awe-inspiring work does . the show's popularity has been waning as of late , and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings . perhaps not . having seen the show on numerous occasions , i can say that it's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie . the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years . parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask : must the show go on ? ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; 
if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you . this unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat . and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness . the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m . inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million . the first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money . what the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( " i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! " ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel . the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) . various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city . screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another . the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is . the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs . without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans . rat race's cast is first rate . cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man " born without a personality . " the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy . along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! and ruthless people . a throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol . this is a fun little feature . the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it . rat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you . 
no matter what you suspect , this isn't your usual action thriller . the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . it's one of those movies that , after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end , you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light . plot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me . keyser soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason . it's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- " keyser soze " in latin means " an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . " or maybe i shouldn't have bought a foreign-language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99-cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets . at the movie's opening , a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup , including mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , fenster ( benicio del toro ) , buckney ( kevin pollack ) and verbal ( kevin spacey , winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 \ f " times new roman " \ s 10 \ h} for his performance in the movie ) . verbal is so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing . he also earns his name as the movie's narrator , spouting memorable lines like " the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist " ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z's in their name is okay in my book ) . we see the story unfold as spacey retells it . the five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car . it's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't refuse . namely , they have to destroy soze's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash . spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent " cripple " character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast . the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion . i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv . a different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again . . . 
every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars " sur-prise ! " into my bewildered visage . it's almost always a surprise . it sure as niflheim was this time . amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason . and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a " boy , i wish that could happen " sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash . another e . t . another short circuit . this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time . america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) . amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama . this is a very sturdy scenario . the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role . the writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the " yeah , but in real life , this would have happen " thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! astounding ! he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it ! i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film . i don't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons . his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , " amazing " grace smith , and , well , i'm leaving it at that because i wouldn't spoil this film for you for the world . let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply . i don't give a rat's ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it's an excellent story , told with excellence . no , i don't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think . the point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen . this is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot . it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness . special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing's manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is 
eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . known for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . with the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up . life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . when all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve . while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight . i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to . it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . 
very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . they live their lives in front of the television . the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . even at this point they have no idea what has happened . they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid . this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they " do his wife " . beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to " do her " . to them , this is the best day of their lives . not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives . they even get to meet the president . but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television . in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you'll never hear the end of it ! 
when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . a show about nothing ? sounds like " seinfeld . " a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? sounds like " the truman show . " what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? which is why i was pleasantly surprised by " edtv , " which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity . the writing , by howard's longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus . in the hands of a less-experienced director , " edtv " could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday's meatloaf . with their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers . program director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment . the hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to . while scouting possible candidates , cynthia's camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame . but on watching the videotape , the show's producers are more taken with ed than with ray . he's cute , he says all the wrong things , and he's 100% usda hick . cynthia's boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages . the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth . " action shot ! " wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster . you get the idea . but soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the 'true tv' cameras are right there to document it . ed's privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media . who should ed go out with ? you can be sure the pollsters have a list . not only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent . matthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america's latest phenomenon . he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers . sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed's mother , and martin landau is one of the film's highlights as al , ed's ailing stepfather . jenna elfman ( from tv's " dharma and greg " ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting . even degeneres and reiner are better than you'd expect . in 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called " real life " in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . as with most films by albert brooks , " real life " was funny , but absurd . the funniest--and scariest--thing about " edtv " is that it is absolutely believable . 
good films are hard to find these days . great films are beyond rare . proof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . i haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . but enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . with no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . dug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . director taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . proof of life is a thinking man's action movie . it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . 
mars attacks ! ( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones . this is director tim burton's finest film to date . many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films . however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 . you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film . it is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you've ever seen . once the silly tone of the film is set , it's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just don't mix . the plot is simple : martians invade the earth . but it's different than any other invasion film . usually it's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans . this time however , it's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans . the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i've seen in a long time . they look funny , they move funny , and their " language " is hilarious . and about the special effects . the effects in mars attacks ! are just about the most flawless ones i've seen to date . the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100% real . there are just a couple of scenes that don't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship . also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise . but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood . could it have been funnier ? certainly . was it funny enough ? yes . was i entertained ? absolutely . on a personal note , i'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war-crazy general decker . finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see . while he's not given the type of role that you can give a real " performance " in , he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue . the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him . 
larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company . the people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler . based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life . woody harrelson gives an excellent performance . he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus . by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt . this is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court . however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he's rich , he's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means . larry flynt's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love . larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love ) . both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs . flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin . althea had joined him in taking the drugs . following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them . as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick . courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea's situation , as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect . it's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away . edward norton plays flynt's lawyer , alan isaacman . again , this is a solid performance . the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt's courtroom antics . flynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it . isaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways ) his points to the court . milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs . larry flynt . it is not really an exciting or thrilling film , but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story . due to larry's character it is also , at times , a very funny film . however , it is much more than that . it is about the fight for freedom of speech , anti-censorship , and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy . an excellent look at flynt , his life , and his story . keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey . 
the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance . plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom . unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) caught in his zipper , and misses the big night . thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her . once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins . critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep . having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics . this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others . then again , maybe my expectations were too high . then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film . continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together . this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged . i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not . not a good place to be . having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline . the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) . on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture . i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting . also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer . and of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still can't seem to find the " right guy " ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) . i did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) . i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux-sympathy british accent . funny stuff . also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip-synched version of " build me up buttercup " , which is really cool . overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes . little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script " dust to dust " into the hands of eddie murphy via ? murphy's neighbour . they only found out about murphy's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night . matt dillon is a high school dropout . in between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business . close to home in his native new york , he co-owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls . cameron diaz stands 5 " 9 , started working as a model at the early age of 16 , and loves cats . ben stiller's father is jerry stiller . he played george costanza's ( jason alexander ) father on tv's " seinfeld " . peter farrelly has written a novel entitled " outside providence " which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin . rob moran , who plays the cop in this film , also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin , and the bartender in dumb and dumber . he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college , and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor/correspondant julie moran . harland williams , who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film , also played a state trooper in the farrelly's earlier dumb and dumber , and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man . 
meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) starring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani in " meet joe black " , brad pitt plays death . that's all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it's like to be human . death assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . obviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? besides eternal damnation , of course . there is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . " meet joe black " runs just under three hours . i've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics . " meet joe black " is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be . every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long . and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should . a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is . pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death . i believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him . i have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was . that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting . hopkins gives his usual excellent performance . he's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner . and in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good . she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her . so , " meet joe black " is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time . had the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review . 
it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time . based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , " the green mile " is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . the ensemble acting in the film is perfect . hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . his pain creates pain for the viewer . however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at " the jerry springer show . " the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile . however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . the speed in " the green mile " is perfect . if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . " the green mile " is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment . 
the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . it's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his " attorney " dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . it doesn't , even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we're laughing , we're laughing at them rather than with them . they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , " riding the wave " of something that seemed special and important . now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the " american dream " of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn't seem to approve , doesn't do anything to stop it either . by the time this scene takes place , they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like , but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . there's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't usually very pleasant . unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . i'm not sure if he's any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . 
i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou . ( huh ? ) well , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in . he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck . against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities . the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle . oh , and its much better than any of those . sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line . in malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story . it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water . sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts . raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . and then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood . if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok . he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here . it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so . jacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought . i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . though the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture . a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming . but at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts . 
susan granger's review of " the closet " ( miramax films ) in this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers he's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory . lonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide . but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management . as evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon's boss . when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man . his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences . even his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain . but not everyone is enchanted . a mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when he's forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon's friendship or risk losing his own job . writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia . daniel auteuil ( " the widow of saint-pierre " ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the closet " is a frankly sexual , adult 8 . it's so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like " la cage aux folles . " 
after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house . the review two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense . each has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising . if a film's box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two . writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit . the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie's ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party . while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom's head . things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses . where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you . david koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom's house or just down the street . by keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) . unfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity . humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting . several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes . also , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away . kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably . his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie . kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most " wife who can no longer handle her husband " parts . while it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls " a private club that i'm not invited to " , where they whisper about things all day long . as jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time . both children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are . fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes . it combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed-in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film . if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year's best . 
a thriller set in modern day seattle , that marked marky mark's migration from the " good vibrations " and " calvin klein undie ad " guy , to mark wahlberg , thespian-at-large , and a mighty good one at that . plot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . boy likes girl . girl likes boy . boy and girl begin dating . parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy . girl steps to boy's defense . family problems occur . girl learns more about the boy . boy goes nuts . fun ensues . critique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? well , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you . it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) . i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) . he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as " best villain " at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) . the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if you're into that kind of thing , that is : ) . i didn't much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie . then again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the " big deal " was about his daughter dating david . his reply : " the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter . " good point . all in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent's worst nightmare . mind you , i still can't tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on . and on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it was a flaming success ! ! another firm recommendation by joe schmoe ! little known facts : director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross ( 8/10 ) back in 1992 , at close range ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1986 , and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 . mark wahlberg stands 5 " 9 , is born in massachusetts , dropped out of highschool ( later got his ged ) , and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch . his brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame . he is also testing the waters on the acting front . 
jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back . the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout . in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year . ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you . ) in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie . it seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent . jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it . jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen . among others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , " action ! " best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies . the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was " stupid " enough to buy tickets to this movie . ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory . ) the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet . guilty . although it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them . it's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny . jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize . his favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything . but it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success . his reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems . the story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) . these charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture . jay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long . one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry . granted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best . and , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far . no , wait . forget , `thus far . ' it's bound to be the funniest movie of the year . in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash , it's great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience . jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 : 35 . it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations . it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday , august 22 , 2001 . in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . 
in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . apparently , it was just lying dormant . with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences . his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer " popcorn " movie season's lack of substance . it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . pass the popcorn . 
the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . this movie closely resembles a james bond flick . it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . as a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . dr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist . yet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . shue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . the saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . all in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . 
tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : " literary . " what's eating gilbert grape ? is such a film . it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . gilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . as the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . as he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . slowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . director lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel . endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife . one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . the same can be said of the character of gilbert . it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , " i knew someone like that once . " gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . in one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie's repeated chants of , " we're not going anywhere , " but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard . johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . darlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert's tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert's sisters . only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . 
you've heard all the hype . you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults . believe the hype . the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy . the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well . amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . i would never call myself a " star wars " fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . for those of you not recently steeped in " star wars " trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in " return of the jedi " and " empire strikes back . " so , obviously , his appearance in " phantom menace " is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . a lot of the movie is like that . r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from " empire strikes back " ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in " star wars " ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive " teenage mutant ninja turtles . " furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . well , he's done a good job . the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . his explanation ? " his future is clouded . " ( warning : major spoiler ahead . enter at your own risk . ) of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin " darth vader " skywalker . did this story need to be told ? i would say no . but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely . if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . above all , this is a fun movie . not deep , not meaningful , and not profound . but fun . maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed " empire " will direct . because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : ) 
118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( " manga " ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as " labors " ( an interesting play on words , considering that " robot " is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime . this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% . this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it . as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . _patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting . as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . giant robot footsteps are deep and booming . the sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they're among the most easily-readable subtitles i've ever seen for _anything_ . large enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment . my . 
bob the happy bastard's quickie review : rush hour so what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ? they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had . that was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film . but , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it's director brett rainer . rush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate's daughter . of course , the fbi is upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that's chris tucker . what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker . tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( " i'm michael jackson , you tito . " ) , and chan delivers a few zingers of his own , as well as some terrific fight scenes . the story's pretty much your average fare , but with a decent twist involving the main villain , a highly clouded figure named jun tao . at least it's entertaining , and the concept is excellently realized . a particular fight scene in a chinese office , where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys , is funny and energetic at the same time . and the finale's a real treat as well . . . chan delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10-story drop . rush hour is just the sort of film you'll get a kick out of on any night of the week . just make sure you don't look for anything culturally different and you'll be fine- drunken master ii this ain't . 
if you've ever perused my college comedy diary " another year in the life of a nerd " ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i didn't get along with my first-semester roommate too well . in fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him . so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room . then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk . scratch that idea . but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal . of course , in my case it would be a silent picture . even without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? ) . i'm glad i did . peter falk's performance was actually what made the movie . and this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries . falk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you " columbo " fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off . falk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid's parents die . the movie begins with the mom's death and the son moving in with his grandparents . after a couple stops along the son's journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave . the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( " communists ! " ) . the movie spans nine more years of rocky's relationship with his grandson , and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with--gasp--a woman , and starts spending all his time with her . so , in his grandson's absence , rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing , achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed . . . or am i confusing movie plots again ? roommates has an almost epic feel to it , covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die . death , though , knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie . roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween . the number can't be counted on one hand , unless of course you're the victim of some hideous genetic mutation . and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie ( no , not duran duran ) . i won't come out and say it . instead , i'll just sit here and hum " eye of the tiger " until each and every one of you figures it out . roommates plays on all the major emotions . it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry . movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience , even though this one bombed at the theaters . my point ? there are no absolutes . or , another possible point , peter falk just isn't such a great box office draw . either way , this is still a good movie and you should give it a chance like i did , whether you hate your roommate or not . 
after the average mouse hunt , the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz , dreamworks try again with the children's film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story . as the film warns us at the beginning , it's not the full story , and some liberties have been taken , but generally this the bible story we all know and love , featuring burning bushes , the plagues and the parting of the red sea . the only thing missing is charlton heston . instead , we get val kilmer voicing moses , an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt ( helen mirren . ) we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses ( fiennes ) all grown up . moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron ( sandra bullock and jeff goldblum ) that he isn't really the son of the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule . he soon sets about this , along with his wife tzipporah ( michelle pfeiffer . ) rameses and his two wizard friends ( voiced by steve martin and martin short ) try to stop moses completing his task . while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults , for children reared on aladdin and hercules , this film could be the most godawful thing they've ever seen . gone is the quick fire humour and standard , easy to follow plot . but , spectacularly , and to dreamworks credit , nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen . jeffrey katzenberg , who produced this film , certainly knows how to keep a child interested . he's included some songs in the film , plus some comedy , and a exciting chariot chase , to keep the children interested . and somehow , himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across , without ever being boring . it's a remarkable achievement . also remarkable is the animation , which puts hercules , an almost 'slap dash' effort , to shame . relying on hand drawn and computer animation , the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed . the film seems a little caught up with it's amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and 'moving' shots , but they _do_ look incredible . the final 'plague' where god kills every first born child , and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed . kudos to the animators . the vocal talent is also very good . val kilmer does a fine job as moses ( although he doesn't sing ) and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses ( and he _does_ sing . ) sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great , and steve martin and martin short are very good , but not in the film long enough . finally , michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife . kudos also goes to the voice of god , who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued . sadly , he is uncredited , and i couldn't quite work out who the voice was . ( but e-mail if you do . ) the songs are good , ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number . they don't disturb the movie , and while not particularly memorable , they are nice to listen to ( they're well sung aswell . ) the musical score is suitably epic , with some beautiful tunes . coupled with the superb visuals , the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat , backed up with a great story . entertaining both for kids and adults , this film is a must see . a david wilcock review ? 1998 " you know , for kids " - norville barnes 
one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting . the main story is about dr . james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr . ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone . they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey . carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there . when nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life . screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients . dr . nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore's financial backing . however , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug . the performances are all very commendable . sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role . kenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital . joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey . charles hawtrey plays an 'out-of-character' role as dr . stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch . some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters . as a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part . other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring 'matron' ) and barbara windsor as nookey's love interest and unofficial 'women's lib' campaigner , goldie locks . both jacques and windsor play their parts well . patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth . the jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing . although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors . a must-see carry on movie . 
if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? " gattaca " is a film which presents a future where society has answered " yes " to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . " gattaca " came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . the way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future " gattaca " presents becomes true . contrary to the misleading trailers , " gattaca " is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . this is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel " brave new world " featured genetically engineered children ) . it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what " gattaca " presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . vincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . but one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( " wings " ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : " men in black , " " a life less ordinary " . . . ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . fortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life . since vincent looks a bit like him . . . after a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . there , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who's genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are . however , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent's long lost brother , anton , who hasn't seen him since they were teenagers . we know vincent/jerome didn't do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome's in trouble , but also the real jerome , who's as much in it as he is . however , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . irene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind . the production design of this film is probably the best i've seen this year : it's stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . and the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life . the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . the acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . but the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he's in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i'm not sure of . " gattaca " warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we'll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . and when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out . 
the seasoned capt . dudley smith ( james cromwell ) questions his new protege , ed exley ( guy pearce ) about his political views when it comes to police work . " would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you knew the person to be guilty ? would you shoot a man in the back if you knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved ? " exley , squeaky clean , innocent , and pent with the desire to perform his new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed 'no . ' stunned , smith pleads , " then , for the love of god , don't be a detective . " la confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to the classic times of hollywood in the 50s . organized crime was the biggest concern , corruption existed everywhere , and every cop had his own way of getting the job done . there was " hollywood " jack vincennes ( kevin spacey ) who gets most of his information from the editor of a sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid , sid hudgeons ( danny devito ) . sporting dark sunglasses and a white sports coat , he isn't afraid to flash his tinseltown style . detective bud white ( russell crowe ) has only a narrow-minded view of the law , and he uses excessive force to exact his unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice . and then there is golden boy exley , wide-eyed and ambitious but extremely naive . a horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together , each of whom become inexorably connected in their search for truth , action , and personal vindication . almost immediately , an arrest is made . but something doesn't seem quite right . new developments become sinuous as the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and crime within the department . suspicion and questions begin to mount . odd alliances are created . and as layers of the truth become revealed , the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment . when the mystery expands , we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the lives of these three cops , including a high-priced hooker ( kim basinger ) and a shady millionaire ( david strathairn ) . all of the characters' levels of involvement are not immediately clear . we watch with riveted fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in the case . we sense a cross-pollination of clues that brings us , the audience , closer to the truth . we hope that the three detectives can throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery . absorbing and affecting , this movie has all the necessary ingredients to create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir . it boasts mysterious figures in control , double-crosses , hard information from sleazy sources , dirty politicians , corrupt cops , haunting women , and hard-nosed cops experiencing moral ambiguity . the underlying mystery is compelling . the look and feel of the movie is gorgeous . the entire cast is crisp and wonderful to watch ( i wouldn't be surprised if cromwell received an oscar nomination for his performance ) . and , the dialogue is rich and memorable . the best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do . " don't start trying to do the right thing , boy-o , " says he . " you haven't had the practice . " " l . a . confidential'' triumphantly achieves the rare gift of complexity and coherence while satisfying our desire for a good old-fashioned movie . 
it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents . while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny . a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik . flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task . when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way . the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them . the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey . when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food . when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food . flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return . instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors . when he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes . a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning . the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative . together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film . its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material . 
sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston ) . he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him . but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back . he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them . suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back . on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him . she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either . after all , people die every day . in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on . the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times . but we haven't . griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since " while you where sleeping " . the camera obscura adds a " special something " to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy . everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting . the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite . meg ryan , known from " when harry met sally " or " sleepless in seattle " , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image . she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl . even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years " courage under fire " where she played a gulf war pilot . matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality . the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them . he has trouble keeping in touch with reality . after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ? his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge . she would do anything to harm anton . she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them . that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier . tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton . he is , well , repulsive . that's all there is to say about him . you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps . he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef . worlds collide , i . e . the usa and france . this can only go wrong . even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can't sympathize with a man who plays " je t'aime . . . moi non plus " on his tape deck . not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for . sam certainly isn't . too bad for anton . for him things take a turn to the worse . " addicted to love " is one of this year's most pleasant surprises . 
susan granger's review of " big eden " ( jour de fete ) it's utopia , this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin , louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people , regardless of sexual preference . there's nary a homophobe or bigot around , much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) , a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam ( george coe ) , the ailing grandfather who raised him . and with the simultaneous re-appearance of his best-friend from high-school and object of his unrequited love ( tim dekay ) , now divorced with two young sons , the fact of his homosexuality must be faced . to complete the triangle , there's the tall , taciturn native american ( eric schweig ) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam . this fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like " welcome to my world " and " achin' , breakin' heart " to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved . in the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness . sure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made . and rob sweeney's photography of glacier national park is spectacular ! on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " big eden " is a charming , quirky , off-beat 7 . it's a heart-warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end . 
plot : this movie takes place over one day . it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran . the rookie doesn't know much about " street justice " , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the " real world " . how even cops like themselves have to " bend the rules " and " break the law " every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys . critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws . i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place . the film gets right into the " dirty " side of , well . . . the dirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there . of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either . and therein , lies the fun of the film . do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ? well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another . and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades . hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these " commercial " roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top . and denzel , well , what can you say about mr . washington that hasn't already been said before ? he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more . he's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way . the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major " coincidence " which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too " convenient " for my taste . i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene . but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts . see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie . in fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone . . . dang , now that's intense ! where's joblo coming from ? the corruptor ( 7/10 ) - crimson tide ( 9/10 ) - l . a . confidential ( /10 ) - lethal weapon ( 8/10 ) - requiem for a dream ( 8/10 ) - seven ( 10/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - traffic ( 8/10 ) 
since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller " blood simple , " joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . in " the big lebowski , " their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning " fargo , " the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude . the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high . the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties . he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks . he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in . one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money . the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here . suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money . by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in " fargo . " " the big lebowski " plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts . it shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies . " lebowski " has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made " raising arizona " such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of " barton fink " ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded " the hudsucker proxy . " the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , " barton fink , " " the hudsucker proxy , " and " fargo . " deakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view . if " fargo " was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , " the big lebowski " marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking . it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end . the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism . with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out . their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light . the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet . 
shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ? if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands . hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and the game is afoot . . . . the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . not quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . from the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript . hamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . julie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . kate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . richard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . nicholas farrell as hamlet's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . in some cases , this made for interesting scenes . billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can't do shakespeare . as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of " yes , my lord " and " no , my lord " in the role of reynaldo . richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . i think he had two lines . then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . this only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . you don't have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . in it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king's english . or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes . 
sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . time alone will make that call . but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side . we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win . that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town . truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers . there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program . what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . the soundstage , we're told , is " only the second man-made structure visible from space . " truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky . the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : " people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . " nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , " i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . " but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side . the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . what does god really think of us ? does he resent our abandonment of paradise ? who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be . he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . 
pitch black is a sheep in wolf's clothing . it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience . don't be fooled . pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest . it starts off with blistering intensity . a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns . among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely . there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film . there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal . and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who's being brought back to justice by johns . the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other . confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment . those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet's wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh . fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet's surface . unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters . the group's savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory . or does it ? pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock " escape the boogieman " conflicts the genre typically serves up . just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false . the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth . a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations . i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist . conversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah . one by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed . imam is forced to reassess his faith . another character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate . yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group . it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick . special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence . his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick . they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger-like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel's mouth . the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked . the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien . the dialogue isn't the freshest at times , reminiscent of a bad comic book . yes , the appearance of riddick's vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation . these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell . twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives . 
mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time . for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big " --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . i'm not entirely sure why , exactly . in many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others . in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america . these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . " drunken master " , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . ( as an aside , " drunken master " was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . ) " drunken master " 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii and " master with cracked fingers " --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been " adapted , " to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka " naughty panther , " a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . " drunken master " features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and it's often as funny as anything , too . and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . but they're still hilarious as ever . likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . the really big thing about " drunken master " , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it . genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on . come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , " whoa . . . " on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . " gone with the wind " , this isn't . still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . it's much more " real " than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . you might very well like it . another interesting thing about " drunken master " has to do with its video availability in the us . " drunken master " is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . thankfully , " drunken master " , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . if you like " drunken master " , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . i particularly recommend " spiritual kung fu " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , the " fearless hyena " movies , and " snake & crane arts of shaolin " . also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , " drunken master ii " , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the " once upon a time in china " series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) . if you choose to watch " drunken master " , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there . all in all , i give this film an . 
first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it . having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things . the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c . two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside . the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien . the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze . we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail . a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas . on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right . the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse . five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head . the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made . their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to " the truth . " the plot , and " the truth , " are uninspired . i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me . it didn't . the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them . but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden . it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that " truth " too high . if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring . but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth . the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either . there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) make this fantastic film feel more real . ward russell's cinematography is very good . the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot . russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding . when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed . finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great . the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be . even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . there might be some romantic interest , but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other . no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . 
buffalo ? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci . gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling . once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married . the truth is he isn't married . to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife . the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don't need money to make a good film . buffalo ? 66 doesn't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events . gallo's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals . the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits . gallo and ricci arrive at his parent's house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house . ricci's performance during the scene at gallo's parent's home are very well done . there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes . the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative . they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine . gallo's character is developed very well . the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear . gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through . his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life . this character seemed very realistic to me . ricci's character is funny and different . she doesn't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her ! ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves . buffalo ? 66 isn't all laughs though . many scenes are very dramatic and depressing . gallo's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing . some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life . the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material . i really would have liked to see gallo's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more . overall , buffalo ? 66 isn't as good as some people put it up to be . the bottom line- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom . 
after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit . spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space . with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit . star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative . remember , the robot ? it wasn't one at all but rather a " phase one assault cyborsuit . " the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors . the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk . cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like " cool . " upon hearing that " command , " cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop . and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes . as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid . even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them . " if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , " his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three . turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend . with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy . spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker . stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as " the fungus . " this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment . the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget . the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing . the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion . " mate with her ! " spencer exclaims . " pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . " the show has many funny twists . in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form . soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat . as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ? cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious . the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments . oh , and eating is pretty funny too . spencer , whose idol is the comic book character " midknight warrior , " gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit . spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle . and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition . for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers . although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story . you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through . star kid runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg for fantasy combat . although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones . my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture . he called it " an especially good movie " and gave it * * * * . when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully . 
bill condon's " gods and monsters " is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics " frankenstein " and " bride of frankenstein . " since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations . whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , " a dirty old man . " in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale's home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . clayon agrees , and doesn't really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . " gods and monsters " is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a " motion picture director , " rather than a " horror director . " and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . it is evident that whale's first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . although boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the " on-again-off-again " friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable . we know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . in lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . if the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . " gods and monsters " is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . walking away from " gods and monsters , " it was ian mckellen's marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . it is a sad testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else's business in the first place . 
when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! ' i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead . what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script . this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between . hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings' . he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck . unfortunately , he is type cast in this role , but fortunately it works well for him in this movie . if only he would dither a little less . julia knows this role well . the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love . there are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness . how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with . the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels . how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment . how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice . 
contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel . it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) . we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project . her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains " pure research " in favor of science with " commercial applications . she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r . hadden ( john hurt ) . then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal . in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega . at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine . it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world . of course , the big question becomes " who gets to ride it ? " ( right after " who's gonna pay for this thing ? " ) . to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep " godless science " from talking to god , or something like that ) . then hadden reappears with startling news . he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . when she returns home , no one believes her . she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . . . eighteen hours worth of static ) . there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet . ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . religious people are presented as shallow caricatures . rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist " religious " doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . what ellie should have said was , " you shouldn't believe me . not without evidence , and i don't have the evidence . i know what happened but you shouldn't take my word alone . " that is the voice of science speaking . the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . also , his profession of " faith " before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren't so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . people watching this film in the future will say , " hey , this never took place during clinton's term . " this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century . better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all . the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ? personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology . i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task . 
let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing . but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . the new " m " is a woman ) . " tomorrow never dies " is the picture " goldeneye " should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since " the spy who loved me " . the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine . as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media . carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from " dr . strangelove " ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) . it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women . enter michelle yeoh , fresh from " supercop " , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . they make a great team . " tomorrow never dies " is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of " turner & hooch " . spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in " goldeneye " . moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's " remington steele " , as has his deadpan wit . and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that " genius is insanity with some success " , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain . in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . there a few too many explosions in " tomorrow never dies " , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here . as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . . it's time to put them to use in something truly special . there's no mistaking , however , that " tomorrow never dies " is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you'll walk out wanting more bond movies . -reviewed december 17 , 1997 
this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar player/musician/composer frank zappa rehearsing with his fellow band members . all the rest displays a compilation of footage , mostly from the concert at the palladium in new york city , halloween 1979 . other footage shows backstage foolishness , and amazing clay animation by bruce bickford . the performance of " titties and beer " played in this movie is very entertaining , with drummer terry bozzio supplying the voice of the devil . frank's guitar solos outdo any van halen or hendrix i've ever heard . bruce bickford's outlandish clay animation is that beyond belief with zooms , morphings , etc . and actually , it doesn't even look like clay , it looks like meat . 
warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown . after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) it's remarkable that this film was released at all . much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed . it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . they're not cringe inducing , at least . the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . bulworth , then , is well worth watching . a david wilcock review ? 1999 " you know , for kids " - norville barnes 
airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making . after all , it's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . even if most people don't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . . . it had to do with bad fish . airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . unable to stop living in the past , ted's world fell apart . he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity . in the midst of it all , something happens . someone gets sick . then another . then another . soon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people . . . and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? ( gee , i wonder ) of course the main draw here is the non-stop " whiz-bang " comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . he's a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . in a film like this , you're not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can't complain about the amateurish quality . what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . i don't know why he was put in there , and i don't think anybody will find a good excuse . and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . aside from that , airplane ! is really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven't seen it . and if they ask what the plot is , just tell 'em " it's a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that's not important right now . " if you've seen the film , you'll understand ; - ) 
books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . the special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . and now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry . either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . can there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? in a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . it's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . it's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and it's about to do so again . this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html or , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ ) . pictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even months before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . in some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . for instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . all the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . however , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . the negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . and _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . it's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . even letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . in regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . go and see it more than once . . . it may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . take along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . there's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . let's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . 
truman ( " true-man " ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film . president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . " truman " also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives . combine all these names and concepts into " truman burbank , " and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . truman leads the perfect life . his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . . . but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . two security guards grab him and throw him out . truman is really suspicious now . it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . " it's best not to think about it , " she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory . truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program . his actions are " real " but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view . we root for the captive of the cage-world . our protagonist is counting on " chaos theory " to help him escape his elaborate trap . the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them . it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them . i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show . carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . but on its own terms , the movie is well made . sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . much of the first part of the movie is the truman show . the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . the music is well-chosen and scored . the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect . when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . philip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening . ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) and the pacing of the story was brisk . there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . it's a quick , straight shot to the movie's end . in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film " clicked " and became an instant classic . nevertheless , i look forward to niccol's next film , whatever it may be . 
near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . 
with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous " ellen " sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . it's also noticeable that this " alternative lifestyle " becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , " and he's gay . " the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and " entertainment tonight " wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of " inside entertainment " , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts . kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat . rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . while in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending . despite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . check this one out . you'll have a gay old time . 
in , " the muse " albert brooks plays steven phillips , a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio . they claim that he's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them . he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over . so he turns to his " best " friend , jack ( jeff bridges ) another screenwriter who's enjoyed success after success . on the way over to jack's house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ? when confronted , jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is , in fact , a muse , a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity , and has helped him garner his success . " she doesn't do any actual writing , " he is told , " but inspires you . " steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she'll take steven on as a new client . jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany's . after the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night . ) steven's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon . steven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life . the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her . and that's a question only time will tell . " the muse " is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( " defending your life " and " mother " ) . the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners . it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential . but , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit . he may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy . and i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it's a nice change of pace for her . and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner , james cameron and martin scorsese . and although " the muse " doesn't have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman's " the player " i still left the theater feeling good . and that's something i wish i got out of more movies . 
it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on . there's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government's been long worried about the younger people getting " americanised " and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex . does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net . but even with such actions , americans remain undecided . the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . what they have ignored is actually a great picture . woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . edward norton plays their jerky lawyer . the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . god's damnation . but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . to go beyond good and evil . this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . 
with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement . with this and " crimson tide , " he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart . that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant . " enemy of the state " is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical . it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . i hate to do this , but last year's film " the game " got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . not that i want every kafkaesque film to be " the game " ( this year's " the spanish prisoner " succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't . will smith's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect . he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . he has a kid , and he's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one . so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering " id4 " / " men in black " territory . he's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of " six degrees of separation " for proof of this , not that he isn't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities . smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) . the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it . as smith's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet . these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they're , well , fascinating : they're doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn't view them as such , and they almost become our friends . we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains . they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs , not because they're evil , but because , hey , it's a fun job , and no one else can do it like them . unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that " the game " was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on . sure , you're chilled , but you're not exacty freaked out by what's going on . but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked . he's a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : " days of thunder " ) , but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated . his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they're always making sure you're paying attention . this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces " enemy of the state " to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . despite never actually becoming great , it's never actually boring and it's always intriguing . watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith's likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom . 
scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously . the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . as stipulated by one of the " rules of sequels " uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . paradoxically , there's a lot less gore . there is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails . craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . after all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little . scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . as in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue . this time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the " true life " events of scream ) . some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) . shortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . craven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the " movie within a movie " sequences . they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . stab features heather graham in the " casey becker " role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as " sidney prescott " ( neve campbell ) . sadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . it would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . following the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . her friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . once the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . she has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . also arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . in addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated . there's a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson's movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney's requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale's new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . ultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . from the stab scenes to lines like " brothers don't last long in situations like this , " craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . their resolution to the obligatory " whodunit ? " is less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . ( " nice twist , " quips the killer . " didn't see it coming , didya ? " ) one senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out . supposedly , there's going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don't come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill . 
there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort . often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with " the hurricane . " this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin " hurricane " carter would normally be called " norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' " as per the tradition of referring to a film " belonging " to a director . but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of " the hurricane , " because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . the book , entitled " the sixteenth round , " opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . " the hurricane " leans on denzel washington . he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length . we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth . he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . " the hurricane " moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from " raging bull , " get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . jewison's best achievement in " the hurricane " is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . there is much to interest a viewer in " the hurricane , " but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . the canadians are good . the cops are bad . the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( " hate put me in prison . love's gonna bust me out . " ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . it's too bad . the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than " he's a racist pig . " i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . criticism has been levied against the liberties " the hurricane " takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . furthermore , much of carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . of course , " the hurricane " works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact : " the hurricane " is a highly flawed film . only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it's a good thing " the hurricane " has that actor . carter has been quoted as saying , " denzel washington is making me look good , " but he's not the only one . washington makes this film look good . denzel washington's " the hurricane . " sounds pretty good to me . 
you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' . it's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away . now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs . the likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi . on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad' . in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory . everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums . now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again . with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters . predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b . edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear' . after shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice . not in the least . norton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg . weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut . in addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence . stiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity . elfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here . the remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice . `keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick . . . though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general . there is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead . once the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful . stiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities . we enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true . this is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements . nonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else's in the audience . `keeping the faith' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion . aww , what the hell . the quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre . 
on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in " lumumba . " patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , " lumumba - death of a prophet , " virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's . ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . some colonial masters were better than others . ) the effort involved in " lumumba " is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life . the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona . the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . " lumumba " is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . 
robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . it is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years . until 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time . the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching . a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because " i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . " all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears . but certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry . upon my first viewing i left bawling . it is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can't help but be effected . the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world . that is what a river runs through it does . it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . both times i've seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up . but the dream is lovely . 
brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito's crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake . carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : " you don't get reformed ; you just run out of wind . " pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character . penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't break . carlito's way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . 
renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as " the umbrellas of cherbourg " and " the young girls of rochefort . " the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion . what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . simon's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . in history , using for her thesis the study of 'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . ' she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control . on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister's new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he's so sensitive . bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . odile still pines for him , but he's married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . love is 'the same old song' that makes the world go 'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love . 
some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s . since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . it's rare that a movie with the moniker " based on the life of ? " comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . however , although la motta is credited as the movie's " consultant , " he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . sex and violence are inextricably linked . the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : " are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? " ) in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . raging bull is the other side of rocky . sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance . in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . how many actors would go that far ? the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's . pesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it's startling to behold . moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . later , she's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few " home movie " segments are in color ) . the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . ( one important recent exception , schindler's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta's perspective . scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . after that , his career was all downhill . yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta's future . the reason is obvious : scorsese isn't as interested in boxing as he is in the character . following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando's speech from on the waterfront ? ( " i coulda been a contenda . " ) perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the '80s . and , if not , it's certainly perilously close to the zenith . 
as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a " great " piece of work and viceversa . attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . for those who are put off by the " art " label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . there are no weak performances in this movie . michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . zhang ziyi is a budding superstar . she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . don't miss it . 
corey yuen's latest film , " hero " is notable on two fronts . first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production . secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao . the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai . poverty and crime rule most of china . a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier . tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army . wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation . their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love . wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction . after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her . first they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous . unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see's night club . the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn . jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home . see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder . see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing . unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung . the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow . the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung's " eastern condors " , is a marvelous surprise . his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious . the stand-out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments , with a stellar performance . his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride . his gangster is almost non-violent , in that he only retaliates , never instigates violence . but when the time comes to fight , yuen biao has never looked better . corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late . the lighting , cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch . the action scenes do not disappoint either . this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i've seen in some time , actually surpassing jackie chan's work in both 'rumble in the bronx' and 'first strike' . the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible . an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed . also noteworthy is the score for the film , done in a marvelously lush orchestral style , not representative of most hong kong fare . i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both " titanic " and " rosewood " as best of the year . all in all , " hero " marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers . this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing . 
a movie that's been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting , " the film of the decade ! " and " a breakthrough ! " can only be leading up to letdown . that's no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your life , that you'll end up changed on the other side , and you come out of the theater going , " eh . . . * that's * what all the fuss was about ? " so , naturally , the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment . and i convinced myself , as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair , actually to try not to enjoy it . let me tell you , that is an impossibilty . the truman show is truly " the film of the decade " and " a breakthrough " and more . and you will come out changed on the other side . such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime , where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling , and this , friends , is it . jim carrey shows that he doesn't need to talk out of his butt to entertain us ; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood's leading men . the film has a difficult premise to tackle , trying to set us up thirty years into the " truman show's " run , but tackle it it does , and perfectly . with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime-time hit . and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the " real " truman show is clever and well-done . people , rejoice ! this is the first oscar-worthy film of not only this year , but of the last five years . not since " schindler's list " has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well . this is a classic in the making , and ( to borrow a line from esquire's review ) it stars jim carrey . nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank ; mark my word . for , as i said , this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre . forget special-effect ladden summer fodder . drop your romantic comedies in the trash . toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile . you need nothing more than " the truman show " to carry you through the summer , or for that matter , the year . oh ! and in case i don't see you , good afternoon , good evening , and goodnight . 
jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . _beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . _beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . instead , he asks who the ghost is . as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . they know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . only paul d is suspicious of the stranger . little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . _beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . this , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . morrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . the movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . taken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . 
" desperate measures " was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97 . for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood's traditional dumping ground : january . now that it's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film . michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) . keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape . he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies . the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son . the film definately has it's flaws . the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status . also , after keaton's escape , garcia's captain barks at him " how many men have to die to save your kid's life ? " which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark . the thing is , it's a vaild point . how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ? what's the greater good here ? many lives or one life ? if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character . place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else . alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience's strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable . despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about " desperate measures " outnumber the bad . the main highlight would be keaton's performance . the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely . he's not as menacing as he was in " pacific heights " or even as menacing as he was in " batman " ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he's evil . even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film . so much so that i didn't mind it in the slightest . and another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you've seen a billion times before . and for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen . but it doesn't , and that's creative .

john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles . so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) . example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go ! was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation . i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity . she responded with her usual query , " whose in that one ? " this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see . if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace . anyway , when i answered " john cusack " , she replied with a rather stunned " who ? " , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to . now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces . i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an " oh - him , yes he's quite good " instead i got a " no - i don't know him " . at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car . cu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool . i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as " the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) " . he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius . with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's . from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon . despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen . and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) . high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit . it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank . it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me . high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his " top 5 break ups list " . this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off . at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery . he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us . gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential ) . though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films . the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy . he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others . but i like this guy , because of how black plays him . the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) . he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films . ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) . but fears and black never let that happen . the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality . he's over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to . catherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own " charm " . tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect . the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation . i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it's hard to see why cusack's character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings . this reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those " special people " whose wheels turn a little slower ) . in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i'd bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective . high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances . fears' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i'm beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i'll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) . but cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian . i'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent . his character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement . 
andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . " they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . " evita " deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to " the top " ) . webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . the film plays like a rock opera , much like their " jesus christ superstar , " with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this . they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . this is why the beginning of " evita " is kind of a let-down . okay , it is a let-down . i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good . but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , " buenos aires , " which is also lifeless . then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , " another suitcase in another hall , " which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off . however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song " goodbye and thank you , " where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . >from the " goodbye and thank you " number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden . but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done " fame , " " the committments , " " bugsy malone , " and " pink floyd the wall " - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings " don't cry for me , argentina , " and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . her death , though , is brilliant . her singing could be better though . i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard . she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti lupone - i heard her sing on an old " evita " cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . but it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . although it gets off to a rocky start ( " rocky " 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's " everyone says i love you " ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . 
hollywood has a . 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations . last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch . serving america for almost 1/20th of a century ! 
naturally , at the core of leon gast's " when we were kings " is the fight itself , for what a fight it was . thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore . with the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life . but " when we were kings " tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match . questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary . gast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali . a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast's film with a forceful swipe at the united states . when ali hollers " damn america' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind . his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : " no viet cong ever called me nigger " , ali reasons . despite showcasing ali's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of " when we were kings " is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion . listening to the film's numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this " rumble in the jungle " is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map . spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a " coming home " to africa . foreman reminds us that africa is the " cradle of civilisation " . fair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality . it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator . while ali respects mobutu's ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers . mailer's insights are lost on most of the film's commentators . george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire . with admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire' s squalid ruling elite . mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power . don king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the " messiah " label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity . understandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal . he may be , as one sympathiser notes , " blacker " than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king . africa , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity . little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali's opponent wasn't white . admittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored . the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time . there is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified . the excitement of james brown and b . b king in concert , for instance . and of course there's always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - " we gonna get it on coz we don't get along ! " . doubtlessly , considering the multi-faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of " when we were kings " faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention . fortunately , by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter , they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event . 
krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy . done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works . professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . however , he found . . . nothing . his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs . 
when quentin tarantino made " pulp fiction " , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to " citizen kane " , hear me out . much like " citizen kane " , " pulp fiction " has changed movie making forever . but i think the latter has had a tad more impact . " pulp fiction " has actually ushered in a new era of film making . it has altered the way films will be viewed . " fiction " has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count . sure , some have been excellent ( " bound " and " the usual suspects " spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes " pulp fiction " as the original neo-noir of the 90s . in this review , i hope to change all the people's minds who have criticized it for it's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn't really that graphic ) . the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay . it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the " quarter pounder with cheese " speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn't already . the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine . the first , titled " vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife " , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim's . they talk for a while ( with the occasional " uncomfortable silence " ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror . after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a " speech impediment " . they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic " you never can tell " . i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win . the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the " die hard " flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge . previously in the film ( like i said , it's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match . as it turns out , he not only doesn't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent . he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence . on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus . the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous " gimp " scene , which is very reminicent of the " squeal like a pig ! " scene from " deliverance " . the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car . they seek help with a friend of jackson's ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball . they end up calling a " cleaner " of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began . if you haven't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition . it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen . earlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago . what the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable . that version cut out , like , half the movie . what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing . for instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses . this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place . just a theory . . . one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e . " psycho " " kiss me deadly " , " deliverance " , etc . ) . but why shouldn't he ? it's not like he out-right and blatantly stole . give the guy a break . in case you haven't already noticed , i believe " pulp fiction " is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as " casablanca " and " the godfather " ) . trust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s . and besides , it's one hell of a ride . note : if anyone knows how i could get a " bad motherfucker " wallet , please e-mail me . any help would be greatly appreciated . 
[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap . as it happens , it didn't take long . ] is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ? known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria . last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature . it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen . at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance . the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused . the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery . the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus . it is zeffirelli's genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace . in this italian master's hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son's worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea . after all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ? what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead . who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a " lethal weapon " ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ? franco zeffirelli , that's who . and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money . what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible . his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed . his movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character . this is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film's end . glenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet's mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i'm still trying to understand the character as written . ( zeffirelli's incestuous interpretation of hamlet's relationship with his mother doesn't help . ) alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy . by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably . of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone . both support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare " this is important ; this is shakespeare ! " i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due . perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare " definitive . " and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen . but if you've ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start . 
i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . when tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . and when it doesn't work , it's just dull . i'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! is brilliant . mars attacks ! is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . it's so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . it's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . anyone who comes to mars attacks ! expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove's buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house's " kennedy room , " a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , " they blew up congress ! " and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . jim brown and tom jones are the film's vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . also on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen's everyone says i love you ) . the real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they're fantastic . with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante's gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton's little monsters are more inventive . the film's raison d'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . the sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it's earned . the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! was in production long before that film's release . cinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas's wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . cronenberg's movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won't be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! is surely a similarly elegant nightmare . this is not a nice movie . ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) by setting the film's final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton's invasion epic suggests that the world we've got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . the victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie's wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . ultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year's funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . 
i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults . the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away . both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers . even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . everyone loves surprises . u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets . this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off . set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship . there's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 . it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships . the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) . once the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down . as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop . this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all . the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations . throughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible . germans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny . all of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move . they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while . 
errol morris , critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast , cheap and out of control , vaults to new heights with mr . death . this film , an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a . leuchter , jr . , is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise , stunning even the more jaded minds among us . don't let the film's cheesy dissuade you . following this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter's life and mind . morris follows the trail of leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up . virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials . after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo-nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened . morris's interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves . zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch . leuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial . part of this effect may be due to morris's new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer . this was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling . combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter's reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary . while this film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape . aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience . 
now , lets first look into the history of shark films . there was the unforgettable jaws . the exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) . now , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones ! russell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease . the substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones . as sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure . with the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days . gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after . this time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all . so-so acting , expected in most of your average action film . jackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines . ll cool j's cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal's cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films . deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer . it does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not  humour ! its like jurassic park under water . nothing too stressful , pure entertainment . renny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) . 
accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . one could almost say the same about his much-prized film . rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . bore is perhaps too strong a word . but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . 
wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . the setting of the film is a town named blue bay . it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors . the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school . it is here that we meet all of the core characters . there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . matt dillon stars as sam lombardo . sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . playing kelly van ryan is denise richards . kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name . in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden . hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists . 
with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ? based on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years . together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through . set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities . jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention . there is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father . the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way . 3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil . when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder . even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder . the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood . the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects . in l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it . there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all . surprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' , pearce and crowe . pearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance . crowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here . superb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever . easily the best hollywood piece for 1997 . 
" when will the devil take me ? " he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over . the spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour . martha fiennes' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt . when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate . with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods . smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin . in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter . he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can . soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce . when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana . this time , onegin finds her irresistable . what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch . overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past . the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like " onegin " . petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in " parking lot " : " you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone . " onegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well . what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go . out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard . tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital . she changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties . tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares . they both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery . _onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of " masterpiece theater " , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm . an mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair . the film has an atypical period look , as well . absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions . the sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists . ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i'm reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) martha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of " yevgeny onegin " is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin's difficult text yet . ms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion . 
" when it's cold , molecules aren't moving . everything is clean . " these are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm . when mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey's life and the lives that surround him . his father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline ) . ben's wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but doesn't say anything . meanwhile , ben's 14-year-old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann-byrd ) into sexual explorations . tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year-old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character . we start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul . he compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody's own anti-matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you'll return . the ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie . everything parallels everything else . the young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods . " when it's cold outside , the molecules aren't moving . everything is clean . " everything is clean because nobody will admit what's going on . even the president is on tv denying his wrong-doings . how can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? all the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that's the point of the film . at first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why shouldn't it parallel itself ? you don't get to know the characters very deeply , but i think that's because nobody in the movie knows each other either . we sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another . at first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you haven't gotten to know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain . the acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood . he doesn't seem to be receiving as much recognition as the others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being . christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy . still , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen's subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline . tobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost . he was needed , but perhaps he should've been used more . the ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year . i hate to say that i don't agree , but i don't . in fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one . even so , it is a very good film . it takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it's art , but when you finally start seeing things in it that you didn't before , you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story . perhaps this is one to see , ponder , and then watch again with different eyes . 
modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome . adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . liam neeson stars as jean valjean . as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . however , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform . inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . two women also get caught up in the struggle . fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . hopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . the supporting cast is also extraordinary . the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing . 
historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with " oscars " . the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . in his time , english king edward i " longshanks " ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by " ius primae noctis " and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . what makes braveheart " larger than life " is his protagonist . mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be . mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . from the technical point of view , the film is also very good . photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of " longshank " 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in " politically correct " hollywood . to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . 
expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you've got baby's day out--an agreeably amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant . the plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old-money home . but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago ! following the path of his favorite story , called " baby's day out , " baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site . while baby stays unscathed , the crooks fare worse for the wear . the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and , of course , suffer multiple crotch injuries . ( john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one . ) like he did in planes , trains , and automobiles , john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set-up and extended execution . here , he's aided and abetted by a director , patrick read johnson , whose choreography could rival a coen brother . best bit : baby crawling across a busy city street . baby's day out has only two emotions--awww and ouch--and the actors play them accordingly . forget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon , disposable as mom and nanny , respectively , the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing . joe mantegna is a great head stooge , barking lines like " that little doo-doo machine is my retirement money . " brian haley has a great scene with a gorilla , while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegna's moe . * he * is funny . needless to say , twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief . 
wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say . this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that's too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie . the story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home . he wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law . time passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement . by the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards . wyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact . who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? somber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes ! still , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff . his , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of " nothing counts as much as blood . " equally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! ) sequence that is decidedly non-pc . director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay . the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics . don't look for much glorified violence here . despite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life . the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! ) . kevin costner is very good in the title role . dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch . he was tougher in a perfect world . his foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday . gaunt * and * gamely , he's a scene stealer who's seen too little . other familiar faces include tom sizemore ( looking like bruce mcgill ) , bill pullman ( looking like jeff daniels ) , and lea thompson ( looking like someone other than lea thompson ) . both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic , while late entries catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid . though the story and score should've tried " less is more , " all other credits are technical tops . production designer ida random , art director gary wissner , and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must've been an enormous budget . clearly no expense was spared . 
in 1994 , an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign . he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby " the dustbuster " holden ( kathy bates ) . the acting throughout primary colors is superb . it would be worth seeing the movie for bates' wild performance alone . she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . primary colors treads lightly on this issue . though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . in fact , most of the " bad guys " are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . although the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president's current troubles ) . primary colors' chief problem is its length . it runs about 15 minutes too long . there are some scenes which could have easily been cut . for example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . the scene's only apparent purpose is to establish stanton's character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . the extra length isn't long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . republicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . it's a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . 
melvin van peebles' " sweet sweetback's baadasssss song " was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , " sweet sweetback " was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built " sweet sweetback " from the ground up almost entirely by himself . because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself . he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases " rated x by an all-white jury , " which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . the storyline in " sweet sweetback " is deceptively simple . it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . at the beginning of " sweet sweetback , " he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : " sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . " van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , " sweet sweetback " doesn't seem all that revolutionary . it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . at that time , " sweet sweetback " was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience " a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . " of course , once it caught on , it caught on big . " sweet sweetback " is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates " sweetback " from other movies like " shaft " ( 1972 ) and " the mack " ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . " sweet sweetback " is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , " sweet sweetback " is certainly not without its controversies . when it was first released , an article was published in " ebony " magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . nevertheless , a movie like " sweet sweetback " cannot be made without conflicting points of view . it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . the fact that " sweet sweetback " was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply " the black community " ) . van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between " sweet sweetback " and all movies that had come before it . when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , " oh lord , let him die . don't let them kill him . let him die on his own . " it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : " watch out ! a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . " beyond the political aspects , " sweet sweetback " is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . watching " sweet sweetback " more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . but there is more to the film than its racial aspect . the legacy of " sweet sweetback's baadasssss song " is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . 
50's `aliens vs . earth' idea revamped ! if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 . it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities . capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen . if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous . id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . id4 is a movie for all . though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . if you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . this film is best watched on the big-screen .

synopsis : committed to an asylum , the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) . abbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure . de sade's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis' work , permanently . review : " quills " is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene . but " quills " also details the marquis' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses . the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie's most intriguing elements , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to cell . to provide a contrast with the marquis , wright involves him with two very different characters . one is the abbe , a handsome , charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god . the abbe lusts for madeleine , but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her . and then there is royer-collard , a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis' motley creations . rush is splendid as de sade , utterly inhabiting the character . kaufman's direction is fine , and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings . the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly , but this is virtually unimportant . for two hours , " quills " acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and , more frightening still , allows us brief insight into his scatological soul . 
by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . that is until about half-way through the movie . suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom . but this is as close as you will ever get to it . instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . " at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . the last half of the film is very well done . another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . " before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . , 
every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . see the best film i have seen in 1996 . not the best children's film . . . the best film . period . based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict . the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty . it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them . there is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because " i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . " more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave . it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father . i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . 
oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! in a perfect world , " a civil action " would be a breath of fresh air . it's cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn't . it's romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn't . and , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending . even if it's based on a true story , a true story which hasn't yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless . hell , " a civil action " is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes " the firm , " the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) . yet it's also oddly and slightly unsatisfying . weird . this is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired " search for bobby fischer " ( didn't see it ) and writer of none other than " schindler's list . " in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories . after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't " schindler's list " just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study . " a civil action " is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study . and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong . the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film . it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying . if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins . it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it . and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness . in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it . in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . point two , it has been through several lawyers . after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company . they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in " wilde , " pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , " fargo " ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i suppose like a grisham novel ) . this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit . because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . it only feels like half of that . maybe even less . and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can't be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . but look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it's difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . that's why i liked this film : it's hard to put a pointer on . you can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren't sure what to make of it . call it the zallian effect . same thing happened with " schindler's list " ( not that i'm comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . each film is so greatly crafted that you can't help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . if only it felt totally complete ( like , say , " schindler's list , " though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . 
barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar , timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks . on the surface , he's coming home for a high school reunion , but since this is a movie , you know that he's really looking for some major life decisions . a fairly " small " film , this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman , rosie o'donnell and a bunch of actors that you've seen before but can't quite place . commendable jobs all around ; they seem like real people . hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit-dead father , terminally goony brother and old high school chums . all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis . the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst . he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor : a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him . the problem is that she is only 13 . unconsummated ( no , it's not _that_ type of movie ) , their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it . star-crossed lovers with no where to go . so hutton is gaga over a barely-teen , one of his buddies is two-timing his girlfriend with a married old flame , another's girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter ( " and she's a vegetarian ! " ) . things are a mess . enter uma thurman . the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls . her character is fun to watch . even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her . like the lone ranger , before she leaves , she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives . the ending is a bit too pat . everything is tied up with a neat little bow . rosie o'donnell is a stand-out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and " tell it like it is " pronouncements . structured somewhat like a " diner , a few years later " , this feel-good story is a good time , but ends a little too nice . 
everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene . everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance . good ! that's what you're supposed to do ! oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning . deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 ) . major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry . when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences . it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) . but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g . pulp fiction ) . pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny . but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter . the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory . the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others . joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) . the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip . they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task . drew also has the famous " dueling banjos " competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged . the men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way . everything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone . they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them . ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men . ed nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist's back . the other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body . disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film . while attempting to make a quick " paddle for it " , both canoes tip over . drew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found . lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition . this leaves ed and bobby . ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow . the question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment " i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing " will have more meaning in the future . deliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i'm doing it again ) . it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic . it's definitely one of those " must see " movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . 
when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr . moreau ) , but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt . the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department . the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones . in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children . animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh . let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off . dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group . the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying . like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices . danny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti . you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god . the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments . the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life . demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice . at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters . we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket . we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh . moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew . ( " all i've ever known to be true is a lie , " moses complains . ) after finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him . after leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses's people go . this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production . it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling . drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last . the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun . the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has . done with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story . even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family . this awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen . the prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 . it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family . how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it . 
when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other " martial arts " flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre . 
i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . but i don't care . not even a little . my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . 2 ) drew barrymore is great . 3 ) the movie is so funny . there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . oh sure , it's trite . and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . naturally , the true star here is sandler . i think the guy is flat-out hilarious . he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . and the movie is just so funny . perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . the film is predicable , but who cares ? the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . i just want everyone to know that i laughed . a lot . 
ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here ! it's title : starship troopers . and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : " the 'star wars' of the 90s . " am i being to generous to this film ? perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a " kick-the-aliens'-asses " style . id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . this new " star wars " has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . and they should be . i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . this is an " event " film , but surprisingly above average . it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange " join the army " ads . mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . stating , " would you like to know more ? " , these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy . this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . and as a result , dizzy signs up . everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . in reality , i found myself watching a space version of " melrose place , " but with better special effects . an hour into the film , the war begins . a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks . a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . the troopers are ordered to locate the " brain " and capture it . i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . it's about special effects and gory violence . director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon . the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear . thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . to most guys , he will come across as artificial . fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . her dizzy is extremely likeable . denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . however , he does give a good performance . michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . his performance rises above the rest . perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen . unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . director verhoeven is the main star of the film . his direction is fast and unrelentless . he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . the dialogue is smart but not too smart . we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies . oh , and the special effects are first rate . starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film . it is extremely violent . in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . now that would be entertaining ! 
true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get " the apostle " onto the big-screen . as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss " sonny " dewey . few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . re-christening himself as " the apostle e . f . , " he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives . but , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . duvall has made his intentions in making " the apostle " clear . in a recent article in " newsweek , " he wrote : " filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . " the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - " the apostle " always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter . after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . " i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny , " he says . when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him . the main theme to emerge from " the apostle " is the fact that good can come from any situation . sonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . however , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . in his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . it is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . watching duvall on-screen , it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . as sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . because he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . as a director , duvall feels that less is more . his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . duvall knew that the power of the film's characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn't need to be artificially enhanced . in this way , " the apostle " almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . 
for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and " high art , " the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative . written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . slow is the best description for the film at first . it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece . one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable . what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . even better are the role reversals that take place within the household . while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . it's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . 
a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza . while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . the original tagline for patriot games was , " there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . " however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare . revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience . i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development . notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom " wings , " shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year . missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . for example , it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . unfortunately , there's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . these flaws are glaring , but they don't detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . 
the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam . ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . ) while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt . maj . archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune . these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles . our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs . they are gates , new father sgt . troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt . chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt . conrad vig ( music video director jonze ) . at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends . barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an " ass-map " that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion . gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt . ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy . so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence . when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help . ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . ) gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck . the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges . but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces . the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime . barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device . his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child . ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . ) i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal . it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib . russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother . ( it's great . ) his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish . one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence . when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast . three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture . stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas . newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate . one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen . ( a friend enthusiastically added , " it's like having sand in your eyes . " ) this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade . ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . ) russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant . ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . ) if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us . its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell . subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status . ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . ) clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , " let my people go ! " hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture . ( it's not spoiling much to write that . ) then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ? ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters . ) russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared . if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded . with flair . 
did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey . but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions . as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth . the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars . based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed . but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast . they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action . and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids . little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space . one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious . it holds the 'key' , literally , to universal peace . a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key' . in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? mandibles ? tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon . therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners . otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key' . now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe . the mib agents on the case are " k " , played by tommy lee jones . he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore . the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes . he is accompanied by a flippant rookie , " j " , played by will smith . but , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie . and , this isn't an independence day knockoff . rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up . but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario . yet , this movie is very appealing . the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who 'lives' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) . it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder . jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity . smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones' straight man routine . they click like dorothy's ruby red shoes . the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam's family ) . this guy has a knack for 'gothic' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen . and , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors . the story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling ! the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows . let the men in black protect and color your world . 
to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world . the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters . mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming , mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say . the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation . the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation . mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place . mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery . yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy . the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d . wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father . also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman . his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters . the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners . the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot . the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus . mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame . at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end . mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain . also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production . it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them . committed to lifelong learning through effective communication 
cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's " black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks " to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , " blaxploitation , " died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film . peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan . registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . ( jackson also has little to " do " in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . ) that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director . this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them . these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional . but if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . from the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . style doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence . what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . 
while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . both films consist of a predominately male cast . both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . some people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . if you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . he agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . after stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . at this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . the supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . due to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . it doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . otherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . 
it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . he had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . for those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . to achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series' theme , which is missing in the movie ) " bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space " , and is monitoring nelson's reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . the format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . only two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester's sidekick , tv's frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . for their big screen outing , the producers have chosen " this island earth " , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . unfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today's standards , are less than impressive . nelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan's dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle's kingdome , and most of them work . unfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite's movie theater seem out of place and aren't particularly funny , but at least they're fairly short . the big question about this movie though is : why ? i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . so , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . nevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you're going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . given its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of " unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies " it does well . 
the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : " it mu5t be found . " so what , exactly , is the fifth element ? after seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever . in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . gaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . while besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . at first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . the story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . while still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the " enemy " --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . it is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . 
saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . starring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . action , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . i'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . tom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . this time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . occasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . edward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . spielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . and what battle scenes they are ! they're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . the gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making . the cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb . it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . it is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . the film never really makes any profound statements . this is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . still , the script could of been a lot better . thankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . saving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting . this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile . it really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie . 
on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail . he says to a black congregation " . . . if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me . " ) well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy . beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california . the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action . the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy . when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days . his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care . first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name . then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination . his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements . bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience . he is hit hard with questions about his voting record . he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up . since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity . they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made . the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers . ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j . fans is not part of bulworth's " truth . " that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie . when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about . ) the experience is liberating . with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth . he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway . why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . chicken wings , appropriately enough . bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product . ( you go , warren ! ) when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews . that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . he's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad . his lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . eventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) overtakes the politics , which is too bad . screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . still , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . as the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . as an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth . as a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . someone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . it's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . after all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . just don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies . 
in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring . phil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . however , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . groundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . the screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . ramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . and the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . the performances are also excellent . bill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . andie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . there is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . chris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . the supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . in fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . overall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . it almost seems perfect . however , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . also , there's not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . overall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . an excellent comedy . overall rating= (

the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug . 26th/1998 ) starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert in " the heartbreak kid " , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i've seen on screen in a long time . he's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another . i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film . as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon . halfway there , he begins to resent his bride . by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife . as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him . the phrase " the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence " was practically written with him in mind . however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes . the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest . the end of " the heartbreak kid " is both hilarious and sad for that very reason . charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin's desire . however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin's whiny bride . she owns every scene that she's in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do . " the heartbreak kid " was written by neil simon and it shows . simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he's at the top of his game here . as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he's the type of guy that everyone knows . the character of george costanza on " seinfeld " seems to have been modelled after him . the only problem with the film is that it's not that funny , and it's billed as a comedy . as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there . " the heartbreak kid " is not a date movie . it has an extremely negative view of relationships , so seeing it with a girlfriend/boyfriend , could be hazardus to your health . 
i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . in many ways , i was surprised by this movie . to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . he provided a fantastic performance . the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . he also seems obsessed and in love with her . but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . for instance , the meaning of the book " the catcher in the rye " and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . and even if you aren't , you should still like this film . 
dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . totally trustworthy , right ? not a chance . once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . but neither side is trivialized . she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . he , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . he is a natural , and never once grating . send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . 
one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . this rule applies highly to kiss the girls . there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . before she is abducted . dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . sometimes a simple shot is the best one . however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . two other essential aspects of the film are quite good . director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . part of the blame falls on david klass . i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . with all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . in fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . morgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . i must also say that i loved the ending . the showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . perhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway . 
people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . but the right stuff film isn't even fiction . it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . ten years later , soviets have launched " sputnik " marking the beginning of the space age . in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time . with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking " artsy " projects . the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives . royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction . most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and " natural " pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , " mercury " astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language . editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . another fine contribution of this film is " oscar " -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . this film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . some of the " mercury " astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . film also lacks proper closure . on the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america . in some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . time has passed ; now we don't see astronauts as heroes . in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . but this film , sentimental reminder of the times " when future began " , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow " mercury " astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . and even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . 
i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture . i still think that " the bridge on the river kwai " doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . and i think that " 12 angry men " , " witness for the prosecution " and " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents . the film is set in burma in 1943 . a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen . struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in " paths of glory " . lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) that means , the picture isn't perfect . but it has a lot of virtues as well . " the bridge on the river kwai " shows the " madness " of war and what it can produce in people's minds . it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . and lean's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . david lean's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . the film is also well-photographed and has an apt score . alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . the other actors deliver fine performances as well . i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

produced by robert lantos & stephen j . roth directed by douglas williams mpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical-gross-outs , and sexual content , i'd put it at pg ) though made in canada , " overdrawn at the memory bank " traces its roots to the bbc school of film production . using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you're twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked . raul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority . caught watching " casablanca " on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to " doppling " rehabilitation--he is to spend forty-eight hours in the body of a baboon . ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody's guess . ) as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it . as time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on . . . while fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there's no better way to hack the system than from the inside . during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings . over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance . given that " casablanca " is fingal's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to " casablanca " . in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called " the place " . julia's portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the " schweethaat " -spouting parody seen in cartoons . negin's peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i've ever seen who wasn't the real thing . the two of them , as characters created by fingal's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system . those aren't the only casablanca characters to put in appearances . the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around . . . as " the fat man " , the alternate aspect of the film's main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c . moore ) . while fingal's body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system . . . with less than salutory results . it's interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition . words like " dopple " , " psychist " , " computech " , " cinema " , and " reconst " are apparently in common use . and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past's idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of " virtual reality " today . as cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it's definitely recommended viewing . the special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low-to-medium-budget television . the music is completely electronic-synthesized , which fits the low budget but isn't really out of keeping with the genre . however , the writing quite makes up for it . there are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in-jokes that one needs to have seen " casablanca " to appreciate properly . all in all , i give " overdrawn at the memory bank " a . 
so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies . the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' . now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill . the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house . if they survive the night they get the money . if not well you get the jurisdiction . having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on . geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people . his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends . steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list . somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party . eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways . what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night . if they can they get the money , if not well they don't . the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum . years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they . everyone who was in there burned to death . now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people . what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night . the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed . one-by-one the people start to disappear . conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all . the people find rooms , which once held mental patients . rooms which once had people dying . rooms which may still contain these people . now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results . since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . i can say however i liked this movie . geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role . famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times . ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs . chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines . peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims . the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing . the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary . i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous . one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell . the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it . i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise . i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously . though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws . but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time ! 
jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . he's mean . i mean really mean . the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . this is that little dog . he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie . 
my summer was recently saved by two very different movies . on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron . then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott . however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) . after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield . the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges . at first , briggs doesn't want to be there . he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone . however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature . the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift . briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers . after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished . and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds . greenfingers , which is " inspired by actual events , " becomes a bit like a sports movie after that . despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show . one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent . of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not " prison love " ) . to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace . i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers . the movie deals with people and scores on that concept . it's wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again . give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting . his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman's last stand in the shawshank redemption . owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy . written by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs . most come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs . the mother can't believe what he'll do if her daughter " burns the sunday roast . " nothing is forced in greenfingers . the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines . primrose and briggs' relationship takes awkward steps . even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it's done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so . after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america's sweethearts and the princess dairies , it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well . 
it was easy to fear the worst . begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir . script , you ask ? who needs one , kid . . . we've got ourselves a formula . that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction . then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . . didn't . the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years . under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go . expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones . the premise is a simple one . dr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm . after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run . his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him . where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy . in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience . in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat . on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants . it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget . later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind . it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right . credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators . the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below . the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized . special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads . and what a pair of performances those leads are . tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat . for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him . it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens . instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , " i didn't kill my wife , " with a matter-of-fact , " i don't care , " we know exactly what he means . it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence . it's his job to bring in a fugitive . this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form . the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that's a shame . for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero . however , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence . the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task . this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business . however , it's time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside . the chase is on . my advice is to catch it . 
" he's back , and it's about time . " was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . the motto was well chosen . the series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . as good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . is it the acting ? hell , no ! paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . the only problem with the acting is eric roberts . one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , " i always dress for the occasion . " but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , " i always . . . dress . . . for the occasion . " you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! he rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . is this problem the kisses to the past ? they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good . is it the script or the movie as a whole ? the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . so what is it ? simple : no plot . the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then . virtually no plot . i was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me . 
defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writer-director albert brooks , who also stars in the comedy . after dying in a car crash , on his birthday of all days , brooks wakes up in judgement city , a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings . brooks has five days to convince two judges that he's worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence . enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant . during his " trial , " brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen , and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant . it's impossible to resist chuckling ( and cringing ) at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth . torn , in particular , is in vintage comic form , and he walks away with the picture . the movie also features meryl streep , appealing as the love-interest , and shirley maclaine , who pops up in a hilarious cameo . while the film is uneven , many of its gags are price less . take , for example , the food in judgement city : it's always the most delicious you've ever tasted . . . and it's also calorie-free--so chow down ! 
ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell . campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became " confused " and were unable to perform the scene . i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . don't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask " have anything to say sam ? " to me , that's not a good sign . also , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . . well , compared to rob and bruce anyway . also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's " gala " premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . overall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it's genre . and the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining . 
seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . [theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . " your friends and neighbors " takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is . barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating . two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word " bastard . " somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film . the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end . although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . in what way " your friends and neighbors " is supposed to work is open to interpretation . it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . 
there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason . " good will hunting " is about one of those people . the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius . he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino . and he works at mit . . . as the janitor . one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( " breaking the waves " 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete . the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it . so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove . and , duh , it's done again . of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will . before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy . after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , " afternoon delight " ) . finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up . turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not . it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge . and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction . is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ? this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . i'm not saying " good will hunting " is a bad film at all . it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar . there are tons of individual moments that i adored . i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either . the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . their relationship never goes beyond " just best friends , " and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . maybe it was just me . and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else . minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable . the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of " to die for , " the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this " best picture " deal ? ) . and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone . 
no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its = purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . event = horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have = watched this will agree with me . it is not even original in that sense , = and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even = blade runner . the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and = methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since = enormously progressed . the event horizon is actually a ship built for a = secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space = thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a = man's lifetime . the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation = but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . a = search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to = check for survivors of the event horizon . the designer of the ship , dr . = weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually = happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , = alien would ever be . while in alien , the crew has to cope with a = ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , = the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful = and horrifying . the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup = is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud = `enough ! i can't stand this anymore ! ' . there are more than enough jolts = to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . the story in itself is not = exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , = average by most commercial standards . even so , the essence of horror is = carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced = storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences = ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship = board ) . =20 director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of = `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the = bounds of the term `horror' . this picture did not do very well in the us = box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most = audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend = their friend to watch this . although on the face of it , event horizon is = mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense = to keep audiences in focus . however , the offbeat horror element which it = ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . my friend and i could = not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the = `experience' of event horizon . i guess it was just the immense feeling = of dread which the film had cast upon us . be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure = entertainment . be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch = this film ! event horizon is highly recommended=85=85but at your own = risk ! it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , = and event horizon is one . 
just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . why is this ? maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . the plot in three words is : women and music . the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . 
one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . sometimes the stories are compelling . sometimes they're not . but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . star trek : insurrection is no exception . the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . i simply enjoyed the film . insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . murray abraham ) , to mess everything up . the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . 
for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . the excitement starts before the music even begins . a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! " you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . and while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . 
synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . in disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . old mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) . fearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead . meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? opinion : east meets west . i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan . i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever . personally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . but even the tiniest details reveal quality . the movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . balance is crucial . a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! the dream team . by the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . it's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . it's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color . 
it's not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts . but that's just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic's big screen debut . uhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid . but it's dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it's so silly and outrageous it's hilarious . the movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he's indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns . george is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks . but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station . george revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like " wheel of fish " and movies like " conan , the librarian . " as the station's ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate . as r . j . fletcher--channel 8's ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls . uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children's shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters . the funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed . like most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss . for every gag that works , at least one fizzles . for instance , weird al's mock video of " money for nothing " by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) . but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way . in fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since . . . well , since airplane . much of the credit goes to weird al's exceptionally inventive script and to the movie's winsome cast . weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning , but because he's not afraid to look silly , he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character . the real standout is michael richards as stanley , the dim-witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children's show : " stanley spadowski's playhouse . " stanley's off-beat , mixed-up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over-night star . he is an endearing mixture of good-natured innocence , high-energy enthusiasm , and puppy-dog cuteness . and above all , he's a good janitor who adores his work . another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips . the cast also features gedde watanabe ( the chinese foreign-exchange student in sixteen candles ) as the karate master who hosts the hit series , " wheel of fish . " also aboard for the ride is fran drescher , who plays pamela finklestein , channel 62's roving reporter . unfortunately , as weird al's girlfriend , victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering , whining , and sulking . her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether . while uhf is not an absolute must-see , it's definitely the ticket if you're looking for a wild and zany , whacked-out comedy . the movie is good enough to see in the theaters , but it may work even better on television , the very medium at which it pokes fun . 
the word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all . what does takes place is more based on character development . the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid . what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at . nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana . ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . ) carol is nick's ex-girlfriend and beth's best friend , sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in . obviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there's a lot of things left out . it's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn't mentioned . and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn't seen them for many years . set in a small ( fictional ? ) town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings . the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future . particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the future . interesting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated 'barntill ? ten' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it . 
plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? kewl ! critique : despite this film not looking like a " tim burton movie " or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! i also have to " give it up " to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of " human beings as animals " then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . i also hated the " kid " character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either . now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . the " surprise ending " that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . so overall , i loved the whole " feel " of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( " this is a mad house ! " - type of thing ) . the guy in this film barely seems to be " put off " by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! ! where's joblo coming from ? the arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) 
bob the happy bastard's quickie review : the matrix what's worse than y2k ? how about a fully digital future where nothing is real ? that's what computer programmer neo ( keanu reeves ) slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix , a movie directed by the wachowski brothers ( the guys behind the hip thriller bound ) . before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role , hold on . there's actually a story with depth here . it seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix , led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss , who looks quite cool in leather , i must say . neo ( reeves ) is pretty much a key player in this fight , although he really doesn't look it at first . could this amateur be " the one " as fisburne thinks he is ? credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build , something that few special effects-laden films seem to do these days . there's plenty of effects to go around , of course , but at least there's a backbone to build them on as well . reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo , particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy , yet great . i wish the villains weren't quite so " generic " ( leftover g-men from looking for a sweet sci-fi actioner with plenty of stop-motion swooping camera angles and , of course , a motherlode of a helicopter explosion . now the wachowskis are headed into horror films with their next project . bring it on . 
carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall . the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects . action and science fiction just don't get any better than this ! the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) . quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars . while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased . now the people who did it are after him . quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead . the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist . it grabs you and never lets go ! this film is a winner from beginning to end . the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga . schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too . the action and stunts are terrific . the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail . the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action . the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish . the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal ! the visuals had such a state of the art " slickness " that they won an oscar . of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science . for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do . who cares ? it's a movie . movies are supposed to entertain . and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat . 
bob the happy bastard's quickie review : i must admit , no doubt's single " new " is quite catchy . it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . the result ? a movie that's just as good as that song , really . it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . first we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he's been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . really , it's all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . the movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . think of it as a , well , ending . the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it's never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . however , it's better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn't . 
oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents . it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century . stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house . the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done . at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal . he is simply trying to tame it . but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them . stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon . he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own . " nixon " is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws . there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking . sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president . joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette . she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon . the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins . everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing . stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined . he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element . at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood . the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere . the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers . still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making . 
that thing you do ! , from first-time film director tom hanks , is an enjoyable tale about a fictional band , the wonders , that goes from a garage band to the band with the fastest selling album in the country . but , the question arrises , will the seduction of fame and fortune corrupt the band and lead them to become just another one-hit wonder , or will they stick together and become the next teen sensations ? the " oneders " , as they are originally known , have their first gig at a very small-time contest . jimmy , the lead singer , has written a catchy song and intends to play it at the contest . but , a short time before the contest begins , the current drummer becomes injured and a replacement is needed . enter guy patterson , skilled musician who currently works at his father's appliance store and is looking to break free from the restricting clutches that bind him . he seems to fit in well , until the group takes the stage . when they begin to play , guy's beat is much too fast and the pace is way off for the intended song . it looks as though the group is doomed to failure . but , the " new " song is a hit ! this leads to another gig , and soon enough , the group has an agent . he doesn't do too much for them , but they do get their song played on the radio . eventually , mr . white of playtone records approaches the group , and he informs them that they want to release a record . before you can say " billboard " , the band is now renamed " the wonders " and the members are speeding their way to fame . the gigs are getting better , their fame is increasing , and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records history . the band is invited to appear in a feature film , and , they then fly out to hollywood to appear on television . after the appearance on television , things start to fall apart . two of the members of the band pretty much disappear , and things are not working out well between jimmy and guy . will the band work it out , or will they split up and go on their own separate journeys towards success ? that thing you do ! , complete with a nifty original song that actually sounded authentic , is a fun and enjoyable movie that , although it doesn't become clear if it wants to be a comedy , drama , or romance , is a well-made look into the world of music . tom hanks' directorial debut was a good one and should lead to more work for him . 
this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . " shine " has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty " life " ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and " love and other catastrophes " ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . i can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . " shine " was one bookend . stand by for the other one : " dead heart " . >from the opening credits the theme of division is established . the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . bryan | brown . in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . the local police officer has the task of enforcing " white man's justice " to the aboriginals . these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is " payback " . an eye for an eye . revenge . usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh . brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal " payback " . ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the " white fellas " church - has a foot on either side of the line . he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . he is part churchman and part politician . however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . she appears to not know this . tony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . he then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time . the fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . everyone is affected in the fall out . to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . suffice to say it's a rewarding experience . bryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . his officer is real , human and therefore flawed . brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : " jedda " , " the chant of jimmie blacksmith " and " the last wave " . in a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as " dead heart " . the aboriginal priest best sums this up . he is asked to say if he is a " black fella or white fella " . 
susan granger's review of " songcatcher " in the midst of this summer's fare of dinos revisited and romantic fiascoes , there are a few thoughtful movies - and this appalachian period drama is one . oscar nominee janet mcteer ( " tumbleweeds " ) stars as dr . lily penleric , an accomplished musicologist who , back in that pre-feminist era , was refused a full professorship at her university . determined to prove her worth , she ventures deep into the rugged mountains of north carolina , where her younger sister elna ( jane adams ) runs a school . there in bear creek , she discovers a treasure-trove of traditional scots-irish and english folk ballads , given a unique interpretation by the insular locals . excited , she sends for recording equipment and persuades vinie butler ( pat carroll ) and other self-sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritage on her edison phonograph cylinders . their music , as she puts it , is " as much a part of life here as the air you breathe . " that's the main thrust of writer-director maggie greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story , which is loosely based on olive dame campbell's foray through the blue ridge mountains in 1908 , but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice . ornery , bearded , banjo-picking aidan quinn falls for the statuesque , passionate " songcatcher , " while elna secretly engages in a lesbian relationship with a colleague ( e . katherine kerr ) . i'm ready to buy the soulful soundtrack with vocalists like emmylou harris , iris dement , taj mahal and young opera star emmy rossum who plays a pivotal role as mcteer's wide-eyed prot ? g ? . rated pg-13 , there's an intense scene of primitive childbirth . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " songcatcher " is an intelligent , extraordinary 8 , transported by the transcendent power of song . 
this " dumb " cowboy blondie who thinks he is a `darn' good loverboy , decides to leave his dusty ol' town somewhere in texas and go to new york . he puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach . when he arrives to new york , he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best `darn' `stud' in the whol'o' new york city . obviously he fails . he meets the 'cripple' rico ( dustin hoffman , who is terrifically good ) in a bar . rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down , so he walks in a peculiar way . rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this 'rich' dumb cowboy . he cheats our cowboy out of $20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears . soon , our cowboy runs out of money : he gets kicked out of his hotel , and starts getting hungry . walking through the city , with " everybody's talkin' " playing in the background ( oh , and his prided techno transistor radio in hand ) , he spots rico in a cafe . rico , half-scared , pours out all the money in his pocket . 60 filthy cents . our cowboy , hungry , is forgiving . he is glad he found someone he knows . rico offers to make it up for him . and he invites him to his place . and what a filthy , cold place it is . our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the ( junk ) bed . when he finally wakes ( jumps ? ) up , he finds rico looking at him . " you wanna cup'a'coffee ? " rico asks in his friendly , sleazy , somewhat-childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy . " what're you ? a goddamn faggot ? what do you want from me ? where are my shoes ? what did you do to them ? " but all his doubts turn out to be unfounded . rico really has a heart . together , they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death . rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida , where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees . but he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida . " we will soon be in miami " is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking , moving end of a film it is . the classic theme music : " midnight cowboy " helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film . whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams , is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable . 
with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall's life is rife with complications . and with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent . but margaret's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated . her teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd . his mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau . " stay away from my son " margaret warns darby reese . her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse . there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight . the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest . with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard . but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated . soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova . alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day . but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected . based on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel " the blank wall , " " the deep end " is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( " suture " ) . it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese . the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel . but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton . swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( " caravaggio , " " edward ii , " " the last of england " ) , plays margaret hall in " the deep end " and , like charlotte rampling in this year's " under the sand , " turns in a commanding and accomplished performance . margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being . the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities . many can relate to that , of course ; it's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors . the end is deep all right , and there isn't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton's canon . 
many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . stephane attempts to remain unchanged . however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters . i am not sure why berardinelli says , " at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . " this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . this portion of the film is where the " sense of closure " could have been successfully accomplished . unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . the directing in this movie is wonderful . the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful . and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . 
weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . `seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it . for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . as well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece " zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully . if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's " wife " ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete . there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . they wear buttons asking `how will it end ? ' i couldn't wait to know myself , though i didn't exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . 
an indian runner was more than a courier . he * became * the message he was carrying . what danger is a bear , to a message ? i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna-marrying , loudmouth . but all that has changed now . the guy has grown up . and that's not all . it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication . one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper . but , no . this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple . penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash . the focus of the story is two brothers . david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer . viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can't name , much less resolve . the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line . it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared . the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere . it isn't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them . life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems . this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face . in fact , i'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing . there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw . i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free-form sections which also work very well . the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do--this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all . in my opinion , it is worth full-price admission . 
after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . this new film has been underrated for no reason . it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films . it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some " unfinished " developments of some characters . the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : " the only wealth in this world is children . more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure " . the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of " part ii " to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , " a check in the amount of $100 million . " but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . but god does not take payoffs . the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . there is a moment in " godfather iii " where michael says : " all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . " . visually this film is as spectacular as the first two . gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better . but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . the third installment has only the plot and visuals . some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal . violence is natural to him . he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed . many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . i disagree . it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life . it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . a man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life . the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . there is no turning back . and no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . here he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven 
capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing . not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time . extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum . alas , the times are a-changin' . in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts . this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit . oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released . advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it . the big hit is quite the opposite . it was hyped as " the new film from producer john woo " , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action . however , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit . the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver . mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps . sadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it . except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode . the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff . wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut . however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough . they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop . normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable . luckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work . the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few . some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism . the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . overall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride . definately one of the better ways to spend two hours . 
almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both " anti war " and " pro-soldier " , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could . lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as " too militaristic " . it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons " chose to show up " for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what " the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn " became to wwii movies . hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch . there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears . and the climactic final assault on the " hill " in question is visually confusing . gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered . and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and " newbie " , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat . the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as " seaman jones " in mctiernan's red october . if you've seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg's vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach . 
" living out loud , " is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . judith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . " living out loud , " which was written by richard lagravenese ( " the bridges of madison county " ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . instantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's " the piano , " for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . she finds the right note for each scene and holds it . and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play . topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model . another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , " happy " ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . the last shot is an especially powerful image . nothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . the relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . as we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . and as , " living out loud , " which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for . 
full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america . this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war . however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp . these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning . as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start . the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved . from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey . apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations . private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt . hartman . the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on . the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt . hartman , continues on . private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor . he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop . that is , until sgt . hartman comes up with a new plan . he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can . pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst . pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine . after graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service . he is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat . when he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start . joker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way . he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die . again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not . a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide . full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past . this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others . that , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion . one thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to . unfortunately , many did . 
in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn't stupid . from that , they went on and created the most plot-driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years . the result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist . the story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen . special investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills " verbal " kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims . kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead . kint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city . along with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible . together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from " new york's finest taxi service " --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins . what follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze . the film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you'll ever spend in a movie theater . the cast is exceptional . palminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there . byrne is terrific , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster . del toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can't understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny . baldwin is also very good , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm . pollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor . however , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey . spacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze . spacey's performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years . verbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy . the film is a good one , a decent film until the last 10 minutes . what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history , for me at least . the revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights , it is something wondrous . you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do . kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful , fast-paced , furiously plot-driven movie with quirky characters , phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle . mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb . without furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end . we do . this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created . kudos also to singer and john ottman , who created the score . they both create what is a true film-noir setting , carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final , jarring ending . there are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) . however , the plot , and that stunning ending , make up for all the flaws and more . if you haven't seen the movie , rent it . watch it . then rewind the tape , and watch it again . trust me , you'll be amazed . 
not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it . it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to " sit for him , " ( pose for a portrait ) . at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's " locker room talk . " boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned " locker room talk , " and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn . he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare . ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; 
with stars like sigourney weaver ( " alien " trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . copycat " borrows " a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . copycat is a good thriller . although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . . 
what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber ? to answer the question , you get director david mirkin's new comedy romy and michele's high school reunion . romy white ( mira sorvino , mighty aprhodite ) and michele weinberger ( lisa kudrow , tv's friends ) have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 . however , when former classmate heather mooney ( janeane garafolo , the truth about cats and dogs ) confronts romy about the 10 year reunion , she is astounded that she forgot . watching pretty woman for the um-teenth time , they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance . then it hits them : they are not successful . what are she and michele going to do ? romy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames , " bag a couple of boyfriends , " and get jobs . romy says this will be easy , but michele retorts that if it is so easy , why hadn't they already done it . robin schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice one-liners . one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life's battle against the bathroom scales . " i was so lucky getting mono , " she says looking at her thinnest high school picture . " that was like the best diet ever . " the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed . romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school . the film's editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life . at sagebrush high , the hierarchy consisted of the a group ( cheerleaders ) , the b group ( drama club ) and the c group ( nerds ) . romy and michele were none of the above . ridiculed as " the weirdoes , " they were constant targets for abuse . even though they were quite attractive , they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others . that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them . complementing romy and michele's lightness , is janeane garofalo as the dark , pudgy heather mooney . heather , who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with " twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go , " has the success and the money that they would like . heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school . garofalo's one-dimensional role is only a side show . this is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of . the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy . they have so much fun acting out their parts , their enjoyment spreads to the audience . , 
there seem to be two reactions to dark city . you either love it or you are unimpressed . count me as a " love it . " as good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better . where the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal . it has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent . not clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone . a man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe . surprised , the attacker runs off . the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman's body in the room . a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he's leaving or what he's fleeing . ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare . an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d . the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch . now if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . . dark city is good on many levels . first , the look of the movie is excellent . give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements . there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements . it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks . proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) . the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay . second , the editing of the film is good . the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the " amnesia " explained , in satisfying increments . also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look . third , the special effects are well used . they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job . one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically . a simple ripple effect is used . a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous . restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive . finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance . unlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful . john murdoch's recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn . his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) . when we finally see the big picture of the movie's world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle . a few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness . 
synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . farquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle . grudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) . review : one memorable aspect of disney's " aladdin " was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents . " shrek " does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass . all the same , " shrek " does represent murphy's best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines . for instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , " now i'm a flying talking donkey ! " and despite its many contributors , the script for " shrek " is full of such comic gems . myers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) . " shrek " takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain . things do go somewhat astray during the film's middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie's greatest strength . but even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology . 
i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . breakdown , then , is something of a surprise . russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . that , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . breakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films . as with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . jeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . when we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . russell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . j . t . walsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here . the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable . breakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats . one of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time . 
a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . a prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . less successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies . like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player . julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? - and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . and that is how it should be . of all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . kaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . plus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . the script follows the familiar lines of the classic . hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . the performances in o vary . phifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . he also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . stiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging . also desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling . why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . it is irrational . but these are minor carpings . overall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . if nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . 
magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft . at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film . it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions . it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking . it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers . director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax . the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives . there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose " search and destroy " seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants . there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son . there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public . and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process . given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) . a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) . hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair . it is not a pleasant movie . there is not one bad note in the acting . it is affecting and layered and wonderful . there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films . then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene . walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing . robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks . director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote . the problem is that he stays on them too long . julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it . after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture . quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around . and just what is the theme ? alienation ? hopelessness ? anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy . the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events . it's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come . at times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time . other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening . anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film ! what's surprising is that it mostly works . if you have doubts about anderson's intentions , i'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame . despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption . despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts . this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling . my rating : a bulleye . ( stars ) a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann . her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful . when she sings " save me " at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as " wise up " mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives . 
the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made . a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget . in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives . the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together . michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group . after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works . three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married . after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times . this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war . the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act . the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future . the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong . the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river . this prison , run by the v . c . , initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other . steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate . michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun . personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes . the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated . michael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital . michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero . he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him . he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam . the third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette . only in this game , you play for money . michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him . the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home . a very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed . the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling . do not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you . 
" jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . dah-dum . from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . perhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie . he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( " it's a perfect engine , an eating machine " ) make it that much more terrifying . when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . " jaws " is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by " star wars " ) . even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's " psycho , " and it never seems to age . although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time " jaws " was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . " it's your first summer here , you know , " mayor vaughn warns him . dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in " american graffiti " ( 1973 ) and " the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz " ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in " jaws , " and they are a threat . every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . the shark in " jaws " was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed " bruce " by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . many have forgotten , but " jaws " was a sort of precursor to " waterworld " ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . 
no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film . all recipes are fictions . twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism . a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . . " . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . " this true story , briefly mentioned in " the shining " , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture . in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west . it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could . capt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a " hero " and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . . in ways he could never have imagined . boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california . upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously " over-medicated " cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions . into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound . seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another . colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself . our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out . soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive . it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence . his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes . there can never be enough , and death is the only escape . . it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through . as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this . teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell . older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces . but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching . it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end . the two main characters are also the most interesting . boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear . his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood . colqhoun is different . he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul . he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically . it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen . the atmosphere in " ravenous " is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal . completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer . here time stands still , and nothing changes . the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage . they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life . men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose . the result is some sort of cabin fever . cannibalism is more like a sick game for them . since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying . it's like " who's going to die first ? " the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's " the shining " . it's hard to not get mad here ! one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers . music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere . a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation . the director herself stated that it was " ok to laugh " during the picture . and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : " . . it's lonely being a cannibal . you don't get that many friends . . . " or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying " eat to live . don't live to eat . " ) . but mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change . every actor does a great job . especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor . this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire' . actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike . " ravenous " starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring . however these little failures don't diminish the impression . this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations . it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always . it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since " the shining " .

note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too . the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of " i just don't know what to do with myself " . rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as " america's sweetheart " by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy . 
trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . denise crosby , who played tasha yar on " star trek : the next generation , " serves as the host . in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the " new yorker " as the first recorded usage of the word . ) unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams . arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well . " every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , " she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession . she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar . " i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , " she reminds us . her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith . along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . few other avocations could give this much satisfaction . these people are having the time of their lives . ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans . the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong . filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions . at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left . they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the " q virus . " the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too . with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist . the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set . he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time . it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family . for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time . he says his patients like it . well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway . there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language . hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible . they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs . the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work . the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator . he fits right in . trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages . 
" when you get out of jail , you can kill him . " starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood . rated r . double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable . it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake . we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep . libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood . she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up . at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . her friend gives her son the phone . nick walks in the room . little matty screams " daddy ! " the phone goes dead . libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead . she gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can't touch her . after a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son's " adopter " . double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . it's not like it matters . this is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . it's silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question . in some films , plausibility is everything . double jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . this is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific . she brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit . thankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story . this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it's great to see a movie that doesn't so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . double jeopardy is really good , but it isn't the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . it's one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . this is a thriller that isn't concerned with being smart or plausible . instead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none . 
vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema's immensely successful blade , released in august . the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . ( for instance , blade's main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow's technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . both have their advantages , and here , carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . when it's all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . this time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . he's a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a " master " ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . valek kills all of jack's team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . apparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . the script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . crow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . baldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith's bad guy . griffith's intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he's got to talk sometime . luckily , he's got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . all said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters . 
i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer . it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the " best movie " honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon . it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it . from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt . in spawn , it was the " living room hell " conclusion at the end . in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces . and all of face/off was pretty dang good . but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches . i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted . and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review . back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots . okay , that one was pretty pathetic . ) few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find . this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black . kind of weird , huh ? ) all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell . i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot . . . sorry . my apologies to o'donnell fans . i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely . he decided not to sell them to me , because they were " innappropriate " . hmm . . . . so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years . good question . i'll move on to the movie now . as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black . ) men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth . not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe . not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that . i'm not even really paying attention anymore . ) the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black . i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the " cool weapons " they had . the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said . and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have . it's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for " black humor " , directing both addams family movies . this movie was basically a " black comedy " , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers . don't get me wrong on what i think of this movie . it's not bad , i gave it * * * . it was mostly entertaining throughout it's run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it . my diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket . of course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that's beside the point . i think . 
bruce lee was a bigger-than-life martial artist ( and ) actor . bruce's unique character ( i . e . , self-produced sound effects , etc . ) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor , james lee . the story is told from his wife linda's point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee's life . however , you can't help but like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character . i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee's life before he became famous : scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english . it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else . scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the ( all-white ) students , cheerleaders , and athletes . it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes . in conclusion , the movie was well made , it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor . and the fighting scenes were all excellent . so go see it and enjoy the movie . p . s . if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven . 
ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers . synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues . but when the clues don't fit , it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city . how come it's always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the 'strangers' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads with big hypodermic needles . the strangers have the ability to 'tune , ' or warp reality using telepathic powers . turns out , the city is not on earth at all . and the reason why john doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers . even with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? opinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always " used to have big spaceships blow up cities . i think we're a little tired of that . " according to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . it's designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . it's a philosophical piece . cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . but science fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? what is the human condition ? what is ethical ? what would a true human being do ? far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . a little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes . the people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available . meanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . when science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it . the existentialists' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe . in dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , " because the human condition isn't located in here .

sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist by fernando vallejo starring bob flanagan and sheree rose . interviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia . produced and directed by kirby dick . running time : 90 mins . this film is not rated . the central themes of " sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist " are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person's life . its protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing . the movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease . an audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , " sick " chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film . flanagan's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff's brilliant 1994 " crumb " , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one . both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects . but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures . behold these works of physical art . among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus , and , --the most disturbing scene of the decade-- , nailing his penis to a board . flanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking . not only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment . most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there's also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her . ) but the most outstanding thing about " sick " is flanagan's relationship with sheree . brimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts " sick " into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people . the last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous . it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy . 
contact is a film that tries to do several different things . it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files . the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey . most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species . the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . the two " sides " are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( " i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth " ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else . the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . 
martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . the performances are absolutely breathtaking . day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . his script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . he is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . the cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . not a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . and like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . 
three things i learned from " being john malkovich " : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there . " being john malkovich " is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time . wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head . after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it . from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here . just don't forget to have fun . clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman . " i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , " he explains in the press notes , " blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose . it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start . this allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface . " spike jonze ( mark wahlberg's na ? ve buddy in " three kings " ) takes it from there . the white-hot director of the beastie boy's " sabotage , " an award-winning parody of '70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut . jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style . his flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly . and then there's the cast . john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows . over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved . once passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates . financially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building . navigating around dr . lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester's dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted . first , there's the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her . and then there's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich . craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions ) . after 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike . then things get a little weird . by the way , if you're concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface . one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up . instead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person's identity . he also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself . the performances are superb . malkovich ( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in " dangerous liaisons , " " in the line of fire , " and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure " con air " ) tweaks his own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn . far from his effete , vaguely reptilian persona , this malkovich is just another schlub , drinking with his pals and trying to get laid ( incidentally , charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad boy reputation ) . as always , john cusack nails his part , handily pulling viewers along even as craig's actions become unconscionable . the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz , both playing against type . kenner , usually cast in icy subordinate roles , is terrific as a highly intelligent , extremely manipulative femme fatale . cameron diaz , barely recognizable under a mess of brown , curly hair , sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich . " being john malkovich " stumbles towards the end , as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots . additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale . regardless , this contemporary " alice in wonderland " is a real treat . i enjoyed watching " being john malkovich , " but only later , after reflecting on the film , did its resonance fully hit me . at one point , craig says , " do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ? " truer words were never spoken . 
it is with hesitance that i call " apocalypse now " a masterpiece . certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's . the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's " heart of darkness " , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . " apocalypse " certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . the plot is fairly simple . captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) " with extreme prejudice " . along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . the movie is visually breathtaking . the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like " saving private ryan " on lsd . the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . the problems come when the film slows down . one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . the film slows down to a drag . sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape , and his entrace into the temple . his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man's mental stamina during bouts of war . but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding . 
because the press screening of " planet of the apes " was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated " mars attacks ! " ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage " mars attacks ! " trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . the apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . from his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . as for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . he doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . as a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . the surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . for the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . the 1968 " apes " boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . the 2001 " planet of the apes " offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that's nothing to complain about . 
satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . " dr . strangelove " ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . " men in black " ) . what's unique about " wag the dog " is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness . in this age of information and technology , we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . brean , along with the president's top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . they pitch him an idea to " produce " the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it ) . soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play . we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . the characters' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . for example , one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . since it's all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . but then there's the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , " this is nothing ! " by the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . the first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . what had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . still , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and " wag the dog " at least succeeds in this respect . however , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . then again , it's a valiant effort . 
based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . on one hand , it is a fast paced action film . on the other , it's a frightening horror film . and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy . ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible . and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn the sound down ! while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) . when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , " end of days " , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out . 
charlie sheen stars as zane , a radio astronomer who listens for sounds from other lifeforms . when he finally gets one , his boss destroys the tape and fires him . naturally , zane is not ready to give up , and he comes up with an ingenious way to do this himself . he is aided by a young neighborhood kid and they discover that the sound is coming from mexico . so zane goes down there to investigate , and runs into a lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly . zane is having marital problems at the time , and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting . hearing charlie sheen deliver the line , " i guess there is something to be said for celibacy " is the funniest thing i have ever heard in a movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames . this is just the setup , and i don't want to give too much away , because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises . charlie sheen , who has had a rocky career as of late , is in top form here . he is funny , serious , and determined to accomplish his goal . sheen's absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie . the story is ingeniously devised by twohy , who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour : disaster in time . the films major flaw is a very slow pace , and not much happens in the earlygoings . viewers may be growing restless for a while , but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it , you will have a good time . 
you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it . that's a bit more difficult . the farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies . if you're not nice to it , you lose . galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned . " the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . " that is the current tagline of " galaxy quest , " a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns . it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in " galaxy quest " costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble . jason nesmith ( tim allen ) played " commander peter quincy taggart " on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do . the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt . dane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line " by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged " ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans . one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of " galaxy quest " followers . they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia . they have mistaken the " galaxy quest " episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel . the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) . nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes . next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship . of course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them . but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians . i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked . taking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody . nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration . the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub's fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek . while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell " i need more power down here captain !

denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washington's very best to date . he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting " the hurricane " a much better film than it actually is . when his rubin " hurricane " carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history . he is that amazing . the problem with " the hurricane " is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . >from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place . the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . his anger is heightened to a point of no control . we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head . from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . he realizes that society is changing . that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . if only the other actors had this same determination . dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . it felt like his character was taken straight out of a " scooby doo " episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids . " the kids " in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in " shawshank redemption " ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in " clueless , " same for david paymer in " get shorty , " harris yulin in " ghostbusters " and liev schreiber in " the daytrippers . " it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin " hurricane " carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get . 
the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode . after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine . after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world . again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it . the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' . someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake . that someone is death . you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . . but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport . alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air . in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft . after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky . the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize . but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances . the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi . before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . . is that one helluva premise , or what ? `final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong . on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that . unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool . you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks . young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' . after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' . low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent . some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 . `final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years . not that the characters are that good . sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend . in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) . aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) . the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! ' toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . . `spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments . not so . `final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening . the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick . the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' ) . but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes . creative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise . what will trigger the accident ? will it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high' ? ( yeah , sick humor ) . will it be the leaking toilet ? the falling fishing reel in the corner ? the murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward . a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach . it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ? it's fun . in that simple regard , `final destination' is my cup of tea . this stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side . after the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you . when will your ? design' expire ? is death waiting around the corner ? the `final' effect is a major case of the heebie-jeebies . 
in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . the only possible solution i can muster is its release date . and not just the timeliness of the " greed is good " subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap . they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching . and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces . boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it " all " . and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it " all " the easy way . he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers . affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance . affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . i know this story . we all do . but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it . as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . his style is sitcom bland . but his writing isn't . younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one . with the exception of affleck's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . he conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he's ferociously cut throat . the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . boiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth's friend and his mentor . diesl shines in his minor role . this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80's , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70's . nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have . nia long , as the firm's secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . the two make an oddly likeable couple . long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . at one point he says to her " i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love " . it's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . there is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . this is okay when taken in small doses , but younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims . it's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . that message being , " greed is bad " . yes it's patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven't seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . boiler room offers neither extreme . it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . 
" through a spyglass , i could see everything . " king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar . consider it a view to a kill made abstract . a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , " i don't know , " ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . what we don't see might not be able to hurt us . just close your eyes and think of england . during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake . rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears . grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape . grace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . the duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . that's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic . rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . why ? they aren't real . the very foundation rohmer's characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory . screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) . 
this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday . jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin . as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him . he has become an unquestioning weapon . he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . but even assassins have innocent pasts . he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school . complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin . calder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequently seen in the us . he was seen in the world is not enough . here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years . he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake . his lair is underground , apparently in a sewer , where he lives like the king of sewer rats . it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet's life . paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair , he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness . by using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world . this is a world that is cold and unfriendly . sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see . this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach . we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that . the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross , but it is sarossy's film all the way . it creates indelible images of evil . i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . ( i do hope they do not use the tagline " don't mess with mr . in-between . " ) 
directed by : pixote hunt , hendel butoy , eric goldberg , james algar , francis glebas , gaetan & paul brizzi conducted by : james levine composed by : ludwig van beethoven , ottorino respighi , george gershwin , dmitri shostakovich , camille saint-saens , paul dukas , sir edward elgar , igor stravinsky rated : g scripture references : 1 samuel 16 : 23 , ephesians 5 : 19 , 1 chronicles 15 : 15-16 in 1940 , walt disney released a filmed experiment . fantasia was a blend of two art forms : classical music and animation . while it was not immediately popular with the audiences of its day , it has since become recognized as something of a classic . according to the program notes , it was mr . disney's intention to have fantasia be a continual work in progress . sixty years later , thanks to the ongoing efforts of walt's nephew , a new fantasia is being released . it was not only worth the waiting , it is evidence to just how far animation has come during the past half-decade . with seven new sequences and one old favorite , fantasia 2000 exhibits an imagination and respect for its art form that is absent from most other feature films . like the original , fantasia 2000 will more than likely bore the very young , although there is more narrative appeal in this newer version and the segments appear to be substantially shorter , perhaps a nod to the shorter attention span of the studio's primary audience . ranging from the silly to the sublime , each segment is preceded by a short , humorous introduction or interstitial by a guest celebrity host , steve martin ( bowfinger ) being the first and most effective . these are quickly forgotten as conductor james levine leads the chicago symphony orchestra through the musical program which , along with the images drawn by the disney team of animators , is thoughtfully and beautifully brought to a stunning synthesis . fantasia 2000 is being released exclusively in the giant-screened imax theaters , making for a unique viewing experience . there is enough variety in the program to provide something enjoyable for everyone and surely , people will exit the theaters with their own personal favorites . for me , that would have to be the jazz age story of four unconnected and discontented people living in nyc who , unknowingly , help each other realize their dreams . drawn in the style of caricaturist al hirschfeld and inspired by george gershwin's rhapsody in blue , the music and images are blended perfectly resulting in a product greater than the sum of its two parts . children will like the short piece set to carnival of the animals by camille saint-saens . here , a goofy looking flamingo irritates the rest of the flock with his yo-yo playing antics . they will also giggle as donald duck , playing noah's assistant , tries to load the animals into the ark to the familiar strains of pomp and circumstance by sir edward elgar . ( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . ) a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended . there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite . but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children . the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas . but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise . music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums . it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians . if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service . 
the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the " talking villains , " blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? i don't understand it myself , but that's what the bond series is based on . for ( i think ) 18 films , we've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . but even i , a king of cynicism , can't bitch about it . and " tomorrow never dies , " the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception . thank god ! the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . no , this is not " wag the dog " - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in comes bond . james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and co-star of " supercop , " nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . thank god again . in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn't spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . yes , teri's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . of course , it's not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she's only in a small part of it . oh well . and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . this time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in " from russia with love " -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . and for no reason whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in " goldeneye , " joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . again , oh well . the action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long . they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the plot's not really essential ) . they're more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . so what if they're distracting ; they're supposed to be ! the acting , from most around is great . yeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she's so unique . the better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them . pussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of " on her majesty's secret service " only to be killed , added some emotional depth . yeoh is notable since she's so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . pryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . and brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . the bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they're so fun and add to the escapism . if you can remember the dalton years , and they're serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . i don't really understand it myself , yet i'm one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states . having seen all of them more than once ( yes , i've seen this twice already ) , you can tell i adore them . while it's not one of the best , like " goldfinger " or " from russia with love , " " tomorrow never dies " is nonetheless a truly awesome installment , even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones . 
richard linklater's " slacker , " made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . ask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , " oh , you know , just hanging out . " linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . . . . it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . the opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in " scooby-doo . " for the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . near the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . another man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . the only problem with " slacker " is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . there are only so many times you can hear , " hey , what's going on ? " " not much , what are you up to ? " " nothing really , just hanging around , " before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . " slacker " is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . i just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . 
how many of us would become strippers ? for those of us who wouldn't , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? that's probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . as you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? in case you haven't guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain't . it's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . it is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . what to do ? it hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . it seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . eventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . these include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . when the sextet is complete , we're given a hefty dose of physical comedy . we watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . as if there anti-appeal wasn't enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising " the full monty " on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . . . and i mean * all * . the movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . it's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . with the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . the amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . there's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn't be better . each character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . the full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could've easily fallen prey to tastelessness . it's one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . either way you see it , it shouldn't let you down in the slightest . and , pun heavily intended , when it's all said and done , you'll be smiling from cheek to cheek . 
seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . " saving private ryan " is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing . the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . " poor " is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there . in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen . the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is " right " and good and that the nazis are " inherently evil . " the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief . to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously . when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , " like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . " the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . when miller's company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off . he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality . the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination , but not direction . along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors . the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible . in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . whether they're arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . sure , there's a zinger here and there , but war doesn't change the fact boys will be boys . if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? that's not a premise for thrills , it's symbolic of everything the film has worked for . it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . i remember reading a " calvin & hobbes " comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , " dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? " " saving private ryan " is the adult version of that question . 
it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . of course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there . payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet . all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . you probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . harrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . while he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done . the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending . 
one of kyle mclachlan's earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) , species ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . plot : a science-fiction picture set in modern times , this thriller follows the exploits of an " entity " from outer space , who likes to inhabit human bodies , use them up until they are completely worn out , and then switch over to the next available receptacle . fbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this " thing " before it's too late . critique : this fast-paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8/10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra-violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock 'n roll attitude . then again , how can you go wrong with an " alien " that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? ! granted , the plot isn't the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad , find alien , kill alien ) , but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture . i wouldn't recommend it to those who don't like car chases , murders , and bland acting , but for all the rest of you out there , those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again , sitting back , slamming back some salsa'd nachos , and relishing in the cheeze some call film . . . have a blast ! ! two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gore-fest . the opening sequence is one of the most rockin' scenes to open any action movie , and the subsequent extra-terrestrial " transformation " is another eye-catcher . even the late 80's special effects were okay . followed by the hidden ii in 1994 . little known facts : this film was kyle maclachlan's first non-david lynch foray into the world of feature films . his first two movie appearances were in lynch's wretched dune ( 4/10 ) and the sensational blue velvet ( 8 . 5/10 ) 
there is a scene early in soul food , george tillman's comedy-drama about a large african-american family and the ordeals they go through during a crisis , that caught me completely off guard . during a wedding , the groom is flirting with some tramp , and in an attempt to to prevent a scene , his mother in law , played by irma p . hall , comes to the rescue . the way in which she does this makes me think irma p . hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now . however , this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them . vanessa williams , vivica fox , and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life . williams is teri , a successful lawyer , who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career . fox is maxine , the strongest of the sisters , which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad , who narrates the film . long is bird , a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married . her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving . at the center of everything is irma p . hall , as big mama jo . every sunday , the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo's house . there is lots of conversation , lots of laughs , and the occasional controversy . mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should . she is stern and disciplined , but also caring and forgiving . everything is going fine , until a tragedy befalls mama jo . all of a sudden , a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family . it gets so bad , sunday dinner is even cancelled . without mama jo's guidance , there is noone to keep the family together , which frustrates ahmad . miles and maxine's marriage begins to fall apart , as he focuses on his music and flirts with the troublesome faith . lem's temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him . and teri tries to prevent maxine's efforts to sell mama jo's house . the third act of the film deals with ahmad's attempts to patch things up . he decides to take over where mama jo left off , and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner . the acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding , with special notices to irma p . hall and brandon hammond . hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy . her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie . brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future . he is wise enough not to play cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth , and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note . tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up . every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing ( except maybe an odd flashback sequence ) . the dialogue is beleiveable and funny . and then there's the food . tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food , and it indeed looks very tasty . i can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family . soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year . 
the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up . the film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood . hrundi v . bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india . hrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job . on the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse . during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can . this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set . many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever . and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j . edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi . clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood . but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur . of course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble . each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous . and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way . the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations . it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say " birdy num-num " ? ) . if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party . it's not going to be one of your all-time favorites , but if you enjoy this type of humor , you'll enjoy the party . 
jerry springer has got nothing on " wild things . " john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline . but even trash tv topicality can't drag " wild things " down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here . " wild things " would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it . high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent . hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph . while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her . to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million . but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations . if there's a major drawback to " wild things , " it's that it's oversexed to a fault . the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off . it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . what we don't see is far more effective than what we do . another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . er , no thanks . also , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . daphne rubin-vega , from broadway's " rent , " tries to compensate for a superfluous character . theresa russell is just plain wooden . and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end . " wild things " has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off . and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in " starship troopers . " matt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . re-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . but what we're given works well enough . " wild things " is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . 
an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc . in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish . she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint . a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness . director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft . besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend . he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain . he shows her as a human being . in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity . the only support and hope is in god . at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers . this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne's mind . god is no longer her support . he has become her obsession . she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny . with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls . after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo . the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere . the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience . besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle . but the film is far from being flawless . the script needs a lot of polishing . except for jeanne , there are no real characters . and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing . as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task . in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost . jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect . but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance . and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part . besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting . there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces . and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the " three musketeers " of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) . though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france . and thus , there is no sense of realism in this film . 'the messenger' has muscles instead of brains . there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking . dustin hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise . jeanne's character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained . was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? or was she truly a messenger of god ? the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious . bess o messenger' is nothing more than a fairly good film . it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater . maybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue . it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv-generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it's on the battlefield . 
all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . i must question the studio that releases a movie like this . the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . i loved the young cast in this movie . consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . but i never used baked goods . ' it is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . there are some less-than-original aspects of the film . a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . ' and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . in it's own way . 
in one scene from " the people vs . larry flynt , " the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally . as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity . the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in " patton " where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag . both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies . overall , that sums up " the people vs . larry flynt . " the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie . the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati . there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . flynt , along with the magazine's rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody's real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on " what guys really want , " explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . the film's prime example of hustler's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt's " naughtiness . " director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine's frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons . flynt's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives . an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law . lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt's wife . norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior . in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . ) as keating blathers about flynt's immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud . flynt's other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse . tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down . a dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers . flynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids . after watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film's climactic courtroom scene . " the people vs , larry flynt " is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt . " if they'll protect a scumbag like me , then they'll protect all of you , " declared flynt . he's right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons . he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt . harrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero . even a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man . an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one . despite its flaws , " flynt " is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod . the story may be candy-coated , but it's still delicious candy . 
here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . but , the thing is , it isn't . it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements . it's about how much it can get into one film . and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs . species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . well , it would seem that he has succeeded . landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . of course , he isn't the first ever . about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . no life lives on it . that is , no visible life . patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember . they blame it on a technical malfunction . back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . however , this time around , most of her " alien " urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . and it has . story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story ) . what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . and it does it quite well . the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off . however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . however , i tend to disagree . what were the alien films about ? and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . the acting is quite good for this kind of film . it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . okay , so it isn't that good . george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch . marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . and , of course , justin lazard . lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ? the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting . species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . hell , i don't even know if i will . what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . medak has also mastered the wonderful " jump ! " moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . 
i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent " talk films " which are finding their way into theaters . the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent . mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint . brooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . he makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . jeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , " i love you , " and john replies with , " i know you think you do . " the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . it's the kind that goes something like , " yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . " it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . there's always the big but . john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . " a great experiment " , he calls it . brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the " great experiment " , beatrice asks , " now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . " she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . " you've named the ice ? " asks john . he's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . " the freezer was a good invention , " says john , " but it's not supposed to be used for everything . that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator . " it's something most of us find strangely familiar . brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , " and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! " you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . i don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . john's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . on screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . in a way , he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . she assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it's hard to get mad at her character . this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . as his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer's disease . that may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama's boy . the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . a solid connection is not really made between john's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . additionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : beatrice : you must think i'm some kind of moron . john : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron . beatrice : well , it takes one to know one . 
a costume drama set in the 1500s , england , elizabeth is a lush , romantic , political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one . when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens , the royal family , so to speak , are upset that a protestant should be crowened , and not another catholic , plus , the new queen , elizabeth i ( cate blanchette ) , was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary's father . the persecution over catholics and protestants isn't the only majority in elizabeth . elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures , and her lover ( joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love ) , in order to rule , successfully , the country , which she did for 40 more years . both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era , and both feature a queen elizabeth i ( judi dench plays her in love ) , or course . yet , i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love , not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i , but because i found blanchette a more powerful , hypnotic sense for the role . elizabeth , also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough , is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award . it's a dynamic , important , breathtaking film of loyalty , power , greed , and trust . shakespeare would die for the book rights . 
even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection . the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings . it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) . another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time . this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) . what helps final destination is its unique premise . unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper . this being already has predestined when and how you will die . according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses . what is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it . the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ? this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers . alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors . alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off . shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal . however , death isn't through with them yet . it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again . the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while . some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock . creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films . sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining . also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously . he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) . the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie . and from this , i had a great time watching the movie . 
if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named " pleasantville . " maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . fine performances are turned in all around . maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't . 
usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock . others will mention meg ryan . but for me , it's not even close . janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . and it's a good thing she's starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull . garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls . in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory's that never moved to america . unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town's annual matchmaking festival . things get off to a rocky start for marcy though . she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub . his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed . the movie runs into a few roadblocks . for instance , the story is very thin . none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo . some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie . i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo's winning smile . the strange thing is that it works . garofalo's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one . 
now that " boogie nights " has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn't be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman's " the last days of disco . " stillman , who made " metropolitan " and " barcelona " using some of the same actors , uses disco's final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . the young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don't call them yuppies ! ) men and women of " the last days of disco " frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . here they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . if talk is cheap , " the last days of disco " must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of " the lady and the tramp " ) . na ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . charlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , " like a kindergarten teacher . " the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . here they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . des ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club's managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . des has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he's gay . whether it's true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . jimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of " barcelona " ? ) . josh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , " book this clown ! " and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice's revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . in fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . while the eschewing of " ferocious pairing " is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the " preferred " dynamics of social group interaction . more mature than stillman's previous two films , " the last days of disco " is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . it's a movie you should definitely get on down to . 
this is a good year if you want plenty of sci-fi on your multiplex . >from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson's powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci-fi/horror that is event horizon . ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year . ) the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive . a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously . this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it's required destination . in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime . however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless . seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts . a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate . the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive . as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around . not a good sign . . . to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago . it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it . something very , very evil . . . the first thing you'll notice in this film is it's incredible visual effects . they really are eye popping , with some great models to boot . the acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments . sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no nonense manner . it is his acting skills that help hold this film together . the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one . it starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur . however , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! ) climaxes i've recently witnessed . overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed . it's very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals . but be warned , the horror scenes , despite being very brief are very , very , gory . not for the squemish ! 
garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men , who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there . shandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle . after a few disastrous " mating " attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won't have sex again until she gets married . the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the " joys " of married life . despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? is a very funny movie . the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well . the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead . but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive . plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) . we never see anything though , it's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness . i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of " less is more " . the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film . annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor . she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of " high hopes " for a lengthy period of time . ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino . . . good lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy . everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality . what planet are you from ? is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions . also included on the disc as extras : a decent making-of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film's original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) . when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it's own isolated track ? well as it turns out , it's a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review . kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc . what planet are your from ? was unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video . this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it .

matthew broderick and high school comedy . the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . but election is far different . this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , " super nice " young girl . she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . so paul agrees and the race is on . but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . well , " i don't even want to go to college , " she says . in election , there are no " good guys " . almost everyone has their own agenda . no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . she is the girl that would be labeled " most likely to achieve anything she wants " in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters . that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role . his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior . but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency . she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . but don't you dare think that election's goals are similar . it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here . 
do film critics have morals ? are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ? naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish . secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc . the difference ? well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much ) . on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal " grudge " against the film company ( it's made by disney ? oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ? it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ? can't be that good ) . this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint . make sense ? ok , but what about comparing ? isn't that kind of along the same lines ? when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ? sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ? is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ? i think it is , and i'll tell you why . a good critic should be able to view the film from the " average joe ( or jane ) " viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film . sometimes that can be tough . " the acting was superb , but i was bored " or " i loved it ! ! it was sooooo cheezy ! " might be used to describe a film . these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique . but which is more important ? and which is better ? an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ? getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway . every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask " how does it compare to pulp fiction ? " and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question . jackie brown stars pam grier , the " blaxploitation " heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars . the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry . max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . also involved is ordell's " surfer girl " girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him . compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time . jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable . in fact , maybe a new face would have been better . jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel " rum punch " . for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making . the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all . it's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans . if you can realize that this isn't going to knock your socks off , then you'll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . 
in many ways , " twotg " does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories . there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold . but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us " the usual suspects " . his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry . the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) . these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough . their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive . given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter . yet , they are incredibly foolish planners . actually , these two never really have a plan . they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked . their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family . if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on . what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss . moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her . these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations . they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high . but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways . the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation . during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed . because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome . we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause . as a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge . the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur . the momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money . you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement . in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it . yet , for the most part , " the way of the gun " stays on target . it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry . 
i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't . george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship . however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . what a klutz ! george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . the film is a treasure to look at . the visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . not since 1997's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang's classic silent metropolis . however , all the sets are so original . the original star wars movies can't even match the grandeur of this film's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . the costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . whether its queen amadala's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember . it is as epic as his schindler's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . there is very little to hate in the film : it's a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . it is the best " fun " film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . 
the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an

flashback " . lebowski's passion is bowling . when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . even worse , they urinate on his rug . the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there . when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks . the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine . later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers . this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . the kidnappers are impossibly inept . the dude and his cronies are even worse . every plan goes awry . you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem . walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling . when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . donny is " out of his league " and doesn't " have a frame of reference " . the film is peppered with people for whom the term " character " would be an understatement . the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde " vaginal " artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with " jesus " ( pronounced with a " j " , not an " h " ) embroidered on the pocket . he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job . buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time . it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband . more like the coen's " raising arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demands an open mind and even more open eyes . a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was . " if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it's not going to be what you expect " ? " when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling " ? maybe there's no real message . perhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world . maybe that's enough . ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about " the man in the iron mask " starring that favorite of 14-year-old girls of all ages . redman@bvoice . com is the eaddress for estuff . ) 
when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be " you too can believe whales can fly " . then it was going to be " you too can believe pastel triangles can fly " . then , it was going to be " you too can believe wood sprites can fly " . finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . there's a lot of flying going on in this film ! as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . is the format effective for the film ? with a few exceptions , yes . the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony . it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's " the pines of rome " . in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the " oceans " of clouds . again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . absolutely beautiful stuff . the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's " rhapsody in blue " . this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's " piano concerto no . 2 " and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's " the steadfast tin soldier " . a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , " the steadfast tin soldier " is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . segment five is the funniest of the bunch . set to camille saint-saens " the carnival of the animals " , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , " the sorcerer's apprentice " . the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's " pomp and circumstance march no . 1 " and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . donald duck " stars " as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat . they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . powerful stuff . segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? " saving the best for last " . set to igor stravinsky's " the firebird " , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin's clip is pretty funny . be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's " ride of the valkyries " , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly .

upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits , i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be " hellraiser meets the crow " . but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing " the strangers " and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked . there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice . i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character . sutherland played the role as a true veteran . upon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography . i would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most . the film flowed beautifully . as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the " dark city " , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in " the usual suspects " . not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy . but if you're not exactly the biggest sci-fi fan , caveat emptor . get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of " 12 monkeys " or " the crow " without the boredom or depression . the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as " 12 monkeys " was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated . and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic-book-gone-feature-film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of . dark city simply puts " spawn " to shame . in fact , during the climax of the film i couldn't help but feel the strong presence of an " akira " -esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie . so my initial predictions were wrong . this film is anything but the meloncholy of " hellraiser " parts one through five . i'm never one to base a film entirly on special effects , so know that when i give dark city it's actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even ( tsk , tsk ) special effects . not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away . the best film i've seen all year , and easily one of the best i've ever seen 
alchemy is steeped in shades of blue . kieslowski's blue , that is . with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release . language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length . as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant . alchemy is divided into three chapters : " charity " , " faith " , and " hope " . while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) . when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her . following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil . events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability . in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a " back-to- nature " cult . alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues . in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art . does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context . through louisa's struggles , she succeeds . while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination . even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention . the cinematography is stunning . city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions . later , when louisa reaches the " wilderness " , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground . it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability . the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use " alchemy " to provide for the needs of the body and soul . and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace . her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal . even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch . alchemy isn't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it's close . 
reflecting on " bedazzled , " a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind . if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way . with her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . it's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down . her next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please . to aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring " steve the copy guy " who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills . eugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way . yet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf . he wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him . however , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell . " dear god , " he prays . " i would give anything to have that girl in my life . " guess who then shows up ? she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse . " seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . " there's even an escape clause . if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over . the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love . but when he makes sweeping statements such as " i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison " , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details . for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else . apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul . his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life . soon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal . given the mischievous nature of the devil , " bedazzled " has many amusing moments . a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance . he ably assumes various personas . his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world . allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her . hurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one . it's clear that she's having a good time with it all . yet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story . but that would be playing with fire . what they've got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is . 
for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor . is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster . it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity . for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood . the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) . but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life . the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair . what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen . shell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives . emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player . patti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car . and anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer . pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it . " why do we put up with it ? " emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch . " we try to talk about it , and look what happens . we fight for 20 minutes . " there's the admirable crux of this picture . girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action . but it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take . the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? ) . they hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall . " subvert the patriarchy , " emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to . the girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti's child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki's tormentor . still , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying . ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . ) perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( " who you callin' a bitch ? " ) . the points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary . long on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste . director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . 's michael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking . the movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn't secure funding . then again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film . the movie's slapdash quality is key to its significance . truth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that's ok -- there's a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination . for all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place . 
this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . this is the best we've seen from disney since " beauty and the beast " ( 1996 ) . this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their " lives " . one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him . woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room . since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , " woody's roundup . " if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . a real effort is made in the technical department . the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the " cinematography " is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on " jurassic park " and " star wars " . the film ends with the " failed takes " , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . but what in the end makes " toy story 2 " a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . it is not difficult to predict that " toy story 2 " would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects . but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . off course , this is not " antz " , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . my choice would probably be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedy of the year . i almost lost my hopes for disney , but " toy story 2 " proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain . 
veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort . when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs . eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake . he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora ) . when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session . the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk . eastwood furrows his brow . as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent . he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand . but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ? jeter doesn't know what he's talking about . eastwood furrows his brow . crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime . the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs . isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments . but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him . denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) . but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera . playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines . when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive . eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes . true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star . this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys . one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker . woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy . woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him . buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend . meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped . al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show " woody's round-up " except for a woody doll . now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan . the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody . if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever . trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered . while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy . the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on " zurg's fortress " ( i . e . , al's apartment building ) . the original " toy story " won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear . while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in " toy story " buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else . buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be . " toy story 2 " addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . this is another big grown-up theme : everything ends . the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten . the other toys are shocked that woody has been " shelved , " and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . after he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . of course , in spite of the heavy themes " toy story 2 " explores , it's also very funny . most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building . the brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . most of the vocal performances are first-rate . tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . however , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on " the simpsons " ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . he doesn't have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . the animation is even better than in the first . especially impressive were the textures of the figures . we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . we can also see that bo peep is porcelain . as you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- " disney and pixar's 'toy story 2' " -- this is pixar's coming out party . to celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . they made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . on the downside , " toy story 2 " follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . overall , though , i had a great time and found " story 2 " to be a worthy successor to the first " toy story . " bottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family ! 
niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . along the way , true love inevitably blossoms . what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival . to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved . ( opens march 20 ) " i didn't know what to expect . it's like something you chase for so long , but then you don't know how to react when you get it . i still don't know how to react .

as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a " to kill " list for his enemies . oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . as gibson delivers lines like , " before this war is over , i am going to kill you , " schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind . oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure . at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun . i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend . some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it . like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all . sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism . and isn't that the point of the patriot ? gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away . he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) . as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields . but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) . forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army . the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right . every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment . and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable . as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done . clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating . you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period . everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge . it's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective . there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin's take-no-prisoners method . what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington . played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact . this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil . his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as " cowardly " and " sadistic . " i disagree with this accusation . tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general . besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized . and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ? heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ? the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks . with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it's a lethal weapon for the colonial times . god bless america ! and god bless the patriot ! 
quiz show , an almost perfectly accurate true story , is based upon the events of the popular television show of the mid-50's , " twenty-one " . on this trivial game show , contestants were placed in isolation booths and then answered questions corresponding to a category of their choice , on which they wagered an amount of points on . the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win . but , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began . quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants , herbie stempel and charles van doren . stempel ( john turturro ) , a former g . i . and your jewish man raising a family . stempel has been the reigning champion on " twenty-one " for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars . in his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him . although , in the mind of the show's producers , herbie stempel is getting old . dan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a " jewish guy from queens with bad teeth " and that the kids need someone better to look up to . therefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win . someone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating . enter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family . van doren had decided to try out for the game show " tic tac dough " because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing . but when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright's assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the " twenty-one " kingdom . van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time , so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer , on purpose , in order to lose the game . after stempel loses the " throne " to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should ) . meanwhile , on his own , dick goodwin ( rob morrow ) , a harvard law graduate , has decided to start an investigation on " twenty-one " to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings . his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved . quiz show is an extremely well done movie , and robert redford's direction is especially superb . the performances turned in by john turturro , ralph fiennes , and rob morrow are very good , although it seems that turturro stands out more than any . quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film . definitely a film you should not miss . 
the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . although dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest . although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness . now , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . the supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a " saturday night live " spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious . characters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome . in all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first " artsy " film . life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . 
susan granger's review of " the perfect storm " ( warner bros . ) " more people die on fishing boats , per capita , than working in any other job in the u . s . . every journey a fishing boat makes can be an all-or-nothing risk . it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying , " says director wolfgang petersen ( " das boot " ) . and that's just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat , the andrea gail , sailing out of gloucester , massachusetts , in late october , 1991 . early in bill wittliff's screenplay , based on sebastian junger's best-seller , we meet the crew of six . the veteran captain ( george clooney ) is frustrated because he can't find fish on the grand banks , yet a rival skipper ( mary elizabeth mastrantonio ) brings in huge hauls . his right-hand man ( mark walhberg ) needs money to build a new life with his girl-friend ( diane lane ) . there's a devoted dad ( john c . reilly ) with an estranged wife and son , a free-spirited jamaican ( allen payne ) , a lonely guy ( john hawkes ) , and a last-minute replacement with a bad attitude ( william fichtner ) . the skipper's convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap , and he does . but then trouble begins . there's a rogue wave , a man overboard and the ice machine breaks - with 60 , 000 lb . of fish that could spoil . but that's minor compared with a deadly monster storm approaching which a boston meteorologist describes as " a disaster of epic proportions " that also threatens the lives of a coast guard helicopter rescue team trying to save three people stranded on a sailboat on the high seas . it's formulaic and there are cliches , but the walls of water , created by fluid dynamics simulating real-life phenomena , are awesome . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the perfect storm " is a terrifying , suspenseful 8 . hang on for the white-knuckle thrill ride of the summer ! 
have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ? or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? these thought-provoking questions are the subject of " final destination , " which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's " the sixth sense . " stylishly filmed and tautly directed by " x-files " alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written " teen-speak , " rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue . at the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris . progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious " coincidences , " including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song " rocky mountain high " over the sound system in the airport bathroom . " john denver died in a plane crash , " alex grudgingly mutters to himself . once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off . arguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates . as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners . carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate . alex's best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can't because of his fearful parents . the teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker . only outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life . that is only the setup of " final destination , " and the less said about what follows , the better . suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself . the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and " final destination " surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away . devon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999's underseen slasher-comedy , " idle hands , " is even more of a charismatic presence here . the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part . one scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful . ali larter ( 1999's " varsity blues " ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father . the other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional . the movie is mainly sawa's , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles . tony todd ( 1992's " candyman " ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . ultimately , what is so good about " final destination " is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films . if anything , it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again .

notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan exotica is a film that grows on retrospection . exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . exotica is very much worth seeing . it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) what is behind the complex plot in exotica ? first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen . exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie . 
vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season . austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity . the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place . myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr . evil , who is given much of the spotlight here . there's an early scene in which dr . evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself . most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were . happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr . evil and the other guests . ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! you want a piece of me ? ' ) the audience was in stitches . there are many good things about this sequel . dr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry . mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all . mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber . this works surprisingly well . afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment . oh , yes . . . the plot . after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil . in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods . here , it's time travel . dr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber . there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless . meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle . once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon . in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' . if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me . ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers . but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss . while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits . the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner . robert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character . one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee . there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) . but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny . don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . . of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression . her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her . and as for fat bastard . . . well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far . but my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! ! but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that . this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot . and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection . if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more .

i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . mrs . doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . wisely , he never aims for saintly . his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . it's one of mrs . doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . it's easy to see mrs . doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . but mrs . doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . 
( dimension films , " scream 2 " 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot . that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there's a first ) . ) " the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , " said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller " scream , " her statement referring to the films of the " nightmare on elm street " series but really putting down franchise overkill in general . the comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas . but like it or not , along comes " scream 2 . " and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions . " scream 2 " is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride . it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california . those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives . plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along . trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called " stab . " and dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during " scream , " has left his job as a police officer for a while . life is tranquil . . . at least for a while . several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it's to trust no one . thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student . cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang . this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of " stab , " making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema . before tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from " stab " which turns scream's now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear . ( " b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! " pinkett yells at the screen . ) it's funny , creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . there are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect . there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original " scream " gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . it can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) . sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like " the usual suspects , " " aliens " and " the empire strikes back . " still , " scream 2 " does so many things right , it's petty to quibble . its penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all . the attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus . and the denouement ( while not as shocking as " scream " 's ) is priceless ; the film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in " scream " with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper . all this and a " scream 3 " is in the works . knowing the series' tendency for self-reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice . mentioning " scream 2 " 'll help them in their argument . 
if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tried his damnedest to play it straight , he wouldn't have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in " i went down . " gleeson , who's not dissimilar to the late " saturday night live " alumnus in terms of physical attributes , plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film . bunny is sent to county cork to " retrieve " one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french ( well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle ) . bunny is to accompany git hynes ( peter mcdonald ) , recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies . that tom french is a mean bollocks . he wants frank back . and a small matter of some ? 25 , 000 that tom's wife was supposed to have given to frank . for this he won't break anyone's thumbs . maybe . inventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach , " i went down " follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs , dimly-lit pubs , and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble . mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , " the butcher boy . " even if you can't comprehend half of what they're saying , gleeson and mcdonald together make " i went down " a trip worth taking . the film is in many ways reminiscent of another " little " independent feature , 1991's " highway 61 . " that film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson's tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that'll make you laugh out loud . witness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company . that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in " highway 61 . " what's also charming about " i went down " is how the relationship between buddy and git develops . their trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it's handled is neither sappy nor labored . the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom . it's a little too hollywood , and what makes " i went down " so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies . sure it's gritty--make that grubby--but it's also pretty goofy . although " i went down " emphasizes the comedic elements of dis-organized crime , there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter . don't let these deter you , though ; " i went down " is a little gem . it's only playing at one philadelphia-area theater--and i suspect it won't be there for long--so catch it while you can . 
zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) . however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a " normal " guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator . the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) . it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . zero takes the case , and the plot thickens . his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) . zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . take , for starters , the great cast of characters . pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs . zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . " i'll shoot you , " he says to stark at one point . " i have a gun , and everything . " his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . 
the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . mostly it's laughable . in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . 
a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins . it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) . he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment . his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age . he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare . he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that . he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) . the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it . on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm . coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender . he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs . with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time . he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain . thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence . but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer . warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph . the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend . the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up . coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . " dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston . this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next . the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder . there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor . but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle . 
it's hard not to recommend " the others . " the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( " open your eyes " ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old " twilight zone " episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , " get on with it ! " as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in " the others , " my reaction was much the same . set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman . anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family . the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do . but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending . " the others " sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist . 
everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with " progress . " giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns " erstwhile fogy " giles into a three-dimensional human being . despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places . giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight . giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located . bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice . but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant . love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame . it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a " fish out of water " tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . it has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . 
( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course ) we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat . about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' . the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . she can't go higher than him . he won't allow it . and what's amazing about " election " is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around " nice " persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . it's with mandy barnett's " if you'll be the teacher " playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success . it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( " drop dead gorgeous " leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen " ferris bueller's day off " . whatever . 
written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes ) directed by robert altman some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel . the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . the only problem : the novel wasn't very good . it was far more pulp than pulitzer . but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . the director ? francis ford coppola . the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? depends on whom you ask . but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . >from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . this is what a great director can do for questionable source material . the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . and life is never so bad that it can't get worse . if you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . and of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . is it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? you be the judge . but back to the picture at hand . in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . what may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . and that , my friends , should make you very afraid . 
we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house . he is well lit via the external house lights . his teacher isn't home . we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open . there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . david's fall over the dark cliff has begun . instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala " pulp fiction " . this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion . the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his " daddy " in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . with a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . but it's us being clapped . we are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . the music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . and it works very well . the 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play ) helfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people . indeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . it shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home . 
i'll be the first to admit i didn't expect much from the emperor's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume . i was dead wrong about all of those things . the emperor's new groove is funny . damn funny . and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones . the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing . the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over . the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us . the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia . here's the plot ; try to follow along . set in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor . when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her " assistant " kronk ( seinfeld's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama . kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco's water world theme park , to save him . then the fun starts . for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination . yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl . the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) . david spade and john goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an old hope/crosby film . spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times . needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days . the best part about the emperor's new groove is how audacious the film is . the sheer weirdness factor is very high . cross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah's boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal . simply put , the emperor's new groove is one of the best children's films out for this holiday season . kids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue . that's a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it . 
scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . . . scream 2 ! 1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled " stab " , which has been developed into a major motion picture . as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of " stab " , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown " copycat " sets out to repeat what's been done . . . and finish what hasn't ! of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain . i will note , however , that the " whodunit ? " did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . all the actors outdo themselves here . we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor . it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor . the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities . if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . it would top off the series quite well , if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series . it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work . like they say , don't mess with perfection . . . but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who's gonna listen ? 
the year is 1962 and the military is conducting nuclear testings . involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above-ground tests that are being done . he urges below-ground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own . marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base's beach in full view of the entire personnel . hank's reaction is one of amusement . he's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how . the problem is carly is a manic-depressive and when she isn't flirting with any man who happens to be near her , she's fantasizing about a fictious world where she'd rather be . typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul-tempered . the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable . from hank's reports which state his opposition to the army's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama . carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach-blond and all . the new home in alabama is pretty run-down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum . after meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat . carly openly flirts with the co . hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool . arguments ensue . the family becomes even more alienated . the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb . back at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father can't deal with their mother's problems . one daughter says , " he's blind and she's crazy . " the other answers , " they're perfect for each other . " it reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co's son ( o'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed . she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open . hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co's wife ( snodgress ) . he confronts the c . o . but not about carly . he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing . a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife . hank is arrested . what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co . he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation . instead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope . he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters . carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time . the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems . the performances are solid throughout . jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife's rage . he comforts her and offers protection . lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family . amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should . blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family . the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) . the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 . he had made such classics as look back in anger ( 1958 ) and tom jones ( 1963 ) . orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years . the film joins an alread promising fall line-up of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone . 
disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center . great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack . ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy . some lack lyrical snap . others need more memorable melodies . boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) so , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored . the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble ! " ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments . while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas . directed by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn , who's having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black . 
it must be tough to be a mob boss . just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . i can believe it , too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with . suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . and who better than billy crystal . after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . playing vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think . placed in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino . it's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so . the man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day . ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) . playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped . the supporting cast sparkles . joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti's pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure' . the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides . the situation is just too cute to resist . it's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand . but hey , if you're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally . and near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat . 
in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out . it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . so , i shrugged , thought , " hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , " so i signed up . all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either . rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature . in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film " sequels " do to their predecessors . the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup . subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ . and it's a big one . >from there on in , it's sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style . again . . . there's nothing new here . and yet there doesn't need to be . the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution . the special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together . once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way . this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e . meadows . permission granted for distribution through rec . arts . movies . reviews and all associated archival . permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached . all other rights reserved to the author . 
studio expectations must not have been high for " great expectations " -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . it's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year . " great expectations " also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann's " william shakespeare's romeo + juliet . " " great expectations " opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . there's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn's ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . finn , who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend ( lone star's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . flash forward into the '90s ( after a brief stop in the '80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it's enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . there , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . when estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . but she's not the only ghost from finn's past that's going to be paying him a visit . comparisons with the afore-mentioned " romeo + juliet " seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . " great expectations " is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where " romeo " was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that's steamier than the film's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . acting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay's occasional slip-ups . hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from " gattaca " ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . paltrow's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . while the actress is at her icily seductive best , we're not told very much about her character , and as a result , it's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don't quite understand why she's fueling his fire . robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . alfonso cuaron's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie's climax . another problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren't familiar with the story . despite its script flaws , though , " great expectations " is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . and frankly , it's nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . perhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine's day , will end up helping " great expectations " ' seemingly average box office chances after all . 
john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . you send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive . in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . about thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . feldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . the species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . ( note that , in the 1970's , we really didn't know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don't have it analyzed yet . ) the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . the script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . the first half of the film has something to offer , as " sil , " the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . her instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . escaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . she goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . the pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . whitaker's role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation's " counselor cleavage . " the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . h . r . giger's design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . the main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn't live up to it . all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . there is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of " scare " scenes stuck together . the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . on the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it's fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . my personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don't enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . mpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) stars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995 
'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday ) cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t . walsh , jeff daniels mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements genre : drama in my opinion : in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an " oldies " tv station ? or is it ? i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy " dollar theaters " after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some " healthy " immorality is not a world at all . instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . that said , the plot goes as such . david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical " relationship " outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours . they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . people got hurt . they cried . they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well . this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better . until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr 
the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself . but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things . not that it's bad , it's just that it's been done before ; and better , in my opinion . i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ? that's basically how i felt about this movie . i mean , it's not very good , but it's not completely bad either . the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) . she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn't give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) . thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) . near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods . once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i'm still not quite sure what line of work he's in ) . making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars . one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) . they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal . after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to " take care " of the problem . managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband . but then one night , cole shows up . . . and here is where the fun begins . from this point on , it's going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects . this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out . and for the most part , they're right ; the rich man's wife has nary one original bone in it's body . but who cares ? if you're looking for good ol' dumb suspense movie , you can't do much better than this . and if you suspense buffs aren't already sold , it has a killer of an ending too . 
it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens . however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill . in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture . the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps . peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation . every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life . he's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities . he's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself . everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck . but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions . he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing . he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like . peter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no , not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude . but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one . although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life . each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible . yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal . ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it . his character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity . he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life . anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film . in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic . the animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity . most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk . one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon . however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny . it's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) . the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny . 
as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous . almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america . so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . it has been done before with varying results . this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . . unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . the ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women . although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . but , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . all in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land . but , don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing 
if he doesn=92t watch out , mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max . of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there=92s some accomplished acting too . although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero . in ron howard=92s latest film , gibson plays tom mullen , a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers . mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation . a veteran of numerous hard-nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently . the casting is what puts this film over the top . the trio of gibson , the kidnappers' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully . sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark . his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h . g . wells=92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of= society . mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below , feeding off the unsuspecting . gibson=92s character is an all-american hero with a few flaws . his cowboy= tactics tend to work , but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with . in a round about way , if he weren=92t known as a man who i= s willing to buy his way out of trouble , his son wouldn=92t have been kidnapped . as sinise says " you=92re a payer . you did it once and now you=92re going to do it again . " one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities . lindo calls home to talk to his kids , obviously shaken at working this case . even the kidnappers are real people , arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars . gibson=92s break-down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective . it=92s one of the best filmed representations of a man=92s world falling apart that i=92ve seen . it=92s not all perfect . the shoot 'em upending , while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution . as well crafted as the scene is , we=92ve seen it before . mullen=92s wife ( rene russo ) has several good moments , but occasionally just seems to be there . while adequate , brawley nolte ( sean ) doesn=92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around . but you=92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one . forget about the large coke , you won=92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later . 
alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it . of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see . it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . the other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . we see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . ( title ) . . . a shot of an alien egg . . . ( title ) . . . alien legs stretch up into the air . . . ( title ) . . . and so on and so on . during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . ripley is revived and asks to see the ship . after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise . it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . and this is where alien 3 succeeds . fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die ) . why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review . >from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach . in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . many critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing . the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . as a result , no weapons are to be found . this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important . we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . while cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . it's quite touching really . charles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . charles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately . lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens . the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world . alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex . although it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism . this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie . while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out . it's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) . in fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little " fake . " whenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake . but perhaps it isn't a mistake . 
every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections . such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life . despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film . you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick . will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it . he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer . he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk . after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor . after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems . in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love . the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film . even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character . alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it . the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character . is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ? of course . is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ? usually , yes . but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ? not very likely . come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school girls . will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition . the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary . all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways . damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary . which leads me to the really good part of the review . the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting . i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom . from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent . robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line . the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting . the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen . when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about . watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about . gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score . i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? . despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year . 
available for rental - october 12 , 1999 10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew . that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance . yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford . their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family " no dating " policy is amended to " bianca can date . . . when [katarina] does . " with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew . don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister " . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . " getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing . when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice . the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit " someone with money . " in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . cameron's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that " hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . " the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend's betrayal , and prom . it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she's all that , and can't hardly wait . yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way . 
1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . what could be next ? whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also " infected " with alien dna . so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . 
voices . . . . . trey parker , matt stone , george clooney , minnie driver . " south park : bigger , longer and uncut " is undoubtedly crude , offensive , mean-spirited movie , that comes off as a politcally correct movie too . if your canadian , a strong christian , fat , gay or anything else , you will be offended . but when you watch this movie , there is no doubt that you will laugh . based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show , south park stars cartman , an overweight , foul-mouthed kid , with attitude , and a sweet side . kenny , a poor kid who gets killed in every episode , and talks with his coat hood covering his head . stan a regular , sometimes boring kid who has problems with women . and kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop . the movie opens with a funny , but messageable song , that all of the people of south park sing . cartman , stan , kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip ( beavis and butthead types ) movie " asses of fire " . but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets , they learn the movie is rated r , which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 cannot get in without a parent or legal guardian . the kids do not understand this , and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets . while in the movie , laughing at the movie , terrance and phillip cuss repeatedly entertaining the kids . they kids then go out and cuss themselves , getting in trouble and causing kyle's mom to go against the mpaa . while doing this kenny learns a thing or to , by proving to cartman he can light his fart on fire . kenny does so , dies , and goes to hell , to find out that satan and saddam huiessan ( homosexual lovers ) , are about to take over the world , if terrance and phillip die . >from here on , nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise . but believe me , this isn't your regular south park tv show , and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more . this film contains extreme profanity ( over 130 " f " words and a collection of others ) . but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way , south park : bigger , longer and uncut has many messages that are embedded inside it . but i bet you will not leave the movie , for at least laughing one time or more . and enjoying yourself . take it from me , south park : b , l , and u , isn't as good as you'd hope , but it is good for some laughs . 
eric rohmer's " pauline at the beach , " is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally . the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) . on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) . while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) . " pauline at the beach , " is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story . instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's " my night at mauds , " and 1971's " claire's knee " ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote . " pauline at the beach , " is a film worth seeing . 
>from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . the concept is deceptively pedestrian . an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations . 
what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ? you get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! ! plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it . adventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues . critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride . if you don't enjoy this film , then you just don't like action movies , period ! if you're young , you'll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times . if you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure . watching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible ! harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor . now if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , " magnum p . i . " . in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom . this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . the same type of opening is present in its sequels . jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number " ob-cpo " . this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed . when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on . 
hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) . they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . originally rated nc-17 for language . not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . killing zoe =========== remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . in english and french . the road to wellville ===================== based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far . bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . he also invented the cornflake . really . checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . what he ends up with is something that i can't print here . phew ! stargate ======== lawrence of arabia meets star wars . this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . that said , there's still plenty to watch here . sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that " somebody else " built the pyramids . less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . star trek generations ===================== trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . and so on . ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead " get a life . " remarkably unremarkable . miracle on 34th street ====================== in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary . john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original . the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle . his chemistry with children can moisten any eye . no claus for alarm . junior ====== arnold schwarzenegger pregnant ? sure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie . what should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along . director ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect . don't expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can't beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie . how's * that * for a collision of acting styles ? 
" i've been told by several people , 'you're old fashioned . you want to do everything by hand , ' " topiary gardener george mendonca complains , defending his continued resort to hand shears in trimming his intricately privet-sculpted animal creations . " this is the only way you can do it and do it right . " snip , snip . " some people believe that we are gonna replace ourselves by building these machines , and that may be , " muses mit robot scientist rodney brooks , who builds robots that run on instinct . " there may not be a place for humans in the future , if we're really successful . " " you feel that there's a and looking directly into errol morris's camera . " i know you are . you know i am . " in some ways the slickest film yet from nonfiction auteur morris ( the thin blue line , a brief history of time ) , fast , cheap & out of control is reportage of the highest order . journalism students should dream of making connections like these . cross-cutting among interviews and filmed segments , morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work , and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix . the fun is settling into your theater seat and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with the other . what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand . one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer . weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations , morris developed an elaborate double-camera gadget he calls , half-jokingly , the interrotron . through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject and vice versa , these folks talk , startlingly , right to the camera -- to the video image of morris , and by extension to the audience . the gardener wonders whether , after his death , anyone will be interested in maintaining the garden that he's devoted half his life to tending . the robot scientist is more than a little pleased to note that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is -- a complicated set of sensory receptors . the mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin animals behave like insects , and notes that they may be more suited to long-term survival than people . and the circus trainer pines for a long-lost ideal that was exemplified by world-renowned trainer and showman clyde beatty , who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere ( excerpted at some length here , with affection ) . starting to detect the patterns ? fast , cheap & out of control contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections , culminating in what feels like an elegy ( the film is dedicated to morris's late mother and stepfather ) . the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future . ( the title is taken from brooks' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . ) with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence . ( further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ) different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream . by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives . at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one's work . this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen . don't miss it . -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by errol morris edited by karen schmeer and shondra merrill cinematography by robert richardson music by caleb sampson u . s . , 1997 -------------------------------------------------------------- 
there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . the " quilting bee " consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter . the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . she's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover . one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . from winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . the performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses . how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . there are probably too many characters . so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband . the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . the stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . to put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't " do much " for me . on the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . finn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences . the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . if there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . 
the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual . plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities . he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this " assignment " , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime . admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters . i didn't like performance put forth from quinn's wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn't show up in most of the film , so that wasn't so bad . i did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision . this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . i thought that was neat . having said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the " fake " jackal met with the " real " jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . little known facts : ben kingsley's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 " 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo's haven of restfulness ) . donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal . 
us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren't thrill rides , but i think that " back to the future ii " is one of the few exceptions . if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future . the film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer's kids . doc tells marty he must take his son's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) . whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn't joking , especially when it comes to the movies . essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it's not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself . at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything's copasetic right ? wrong . since when do things go according to plan in the " back to the future " movies ? there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won't even bother to list them all . basically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath . the films' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle . it's difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail . the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense . instead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories . by the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn't seem gratuitous . " back to the future part ii " is a really great adventure movie . it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor . 
i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality . but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations . it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation . in addition , it's also a terrific family film . this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools . it could also be described as `mrs . streep's opus' . yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad . out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view . she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied . one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven . after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama . at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material . it doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr . holland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth . the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate . yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work . angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience . blue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest . gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force . it's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner . the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin . there's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman . in it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth . it's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision . it's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal . watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ? of course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ? mission accomplished , wes . thankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film . in it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile . the child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme . the mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . . basically everything is there . it doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing . the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals . 
ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars synopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church . he replies something like : " the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire . well , the fire wasn't that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows . " in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding . everyone has had to evacuate because it's raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break . enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) . suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters . tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life . this makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call . he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) . but unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom's initial distress call . will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ? opinion : don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics . there's not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that's what makes it escapist and fun . relax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn . 
after a rather disappointing " mary railly " , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise . this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart . in fact it's not even a comedy . it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs . based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness . rob gordon was a dj . it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life . now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york . when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose . decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important . he starts " categorizing " life , dividing it into " top 5 lists " . and the most important is the " top 5 list " over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy . though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first . where did he go wrong ? was it he that screwed up ? or maybe life just stinks ? while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the " top 5 list " over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together . with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me . although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word . and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned . he is simply superb . it is as much his movie as it is frears' . the film would not be the same without him . cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony . most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off . his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen . the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job . both ______ and jack black are fabulous . even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful . however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick . this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination . he is simply a joy to behold . otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend . pretty much like edward norton's " keeping the faith " , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry . it's a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself . nothing seems unreal or staged . it reflects reality as a mirror . as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character . you feel and think and reflect . this effect has become a rarity nowadays . although it's primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music . rob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs . music is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives . and so does the movie . it is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments . in the end , you have gained something while watching it . it's not the film of the century or even of the year . it's not an special effects extravaganza . it doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed . it's a small movie about the big things . and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . 
what is freedom ? how does one determine who is free ? in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now . yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations . that is , in essence , what steven spielberg's gripping drama " amistad " is about . through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard " la amistad " . on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew . however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder . in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away . the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back . the two spaniards who own " la amistad " want the slaves for themselves . the american ship that found the slaves also wants them . in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free . they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them . through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . the film itself is a visual wonder . spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well . at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical . however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag . the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified . the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman's abolitionist . but spielberg's finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque's family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning . it is this emotional force that carries the film . mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar . the movie , however , belongs to hounsou . his emotional intensity is brilliant . spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating . the film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard . but that doesn't matter . the story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance . kudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque . a good job all around . 
billed as a " feminist sex fantasy " , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions . camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence . however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance . political considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) . in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss . this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality . in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it . when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her . these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence . god herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a " her " - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction . this bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances . making her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame . hartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents . it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of " boogie nights " , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry . making a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie . the other performances are equally solid . daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role . shauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut . overall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed . at one point , the title character declares that " instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work " . the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive . roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences . the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful . the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia . amazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies . this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day . bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one . it's funny , sexy and subversive . and it shouldn't be missed . 
robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . we also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . she exclaims " here i come ! " and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . so begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as " a southern spin on fargo , " except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . robert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . indeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific " aunt alexandria " character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . cookie's fortune is such a movie . i loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . i even liked the trite " in the south everybody is related to everybody " cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . i'm not sure why cookie's fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . perhaps it's that good ol' southern charm . 
for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro . if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house . that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie . it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either . in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ? that is endlessly refreshing . in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track . the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story . what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important . david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm . he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact . but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character . he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family . robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing . he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding . the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) . robbie takes it hard . he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings " love stinks " at a wedding . julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to . eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia . he really likes her , but she's engaged . her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand . julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her . you know the story . you've seen it a million times before . there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story . and sometimes , it works . the wedding singer works . first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective . actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension . sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love . barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with . sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other . second , their love is mature . they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material . instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with . at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by . the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child . the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie . other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack . i liked it in spite of the soundtrack . often , the music and references felt forced . for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to " get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . " ( ha ha ha . get it ? david lee roth did leave van halen ! ) or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove . ( that's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) . unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding . that's not to say the movie isn't funny . screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination . herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style . let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over . with barrymore's charm and sandler's heart , it was hard to go wrong . 
i feel no hesitation in saying that " there's something about mary " is the best film that i will see all year . from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . it is that good of a film . when gene siskel said this about " fargo " only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . now for the shocker ; " mary " is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( " pink flamingos " obviously notwithstanding ) . the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . forget " blazing saddles " , " animal house " and even the former king of gross-out comedy , " monty python's meaning of life " ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses . in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is " monty python and the holy grail " ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of " mary " ; it has a huge heart . you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers . they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . it's funny , though . if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . but believe me , it is anything but . ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . early brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from " scream " ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . in one of the film's funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won't ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . jump to the present . after years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . after all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? somehow , the farrelly's pull it off . the performances here are also right on target . as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary's brother . no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . as good as the actors are , though , it's the directors' movie all the way . i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg's wwii epic " saving private ryan " . and yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for minutes at a time ? i'll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . there is just something about " mary " . 
plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes . this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery . critique : awesome ! i love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so yes , i really dug this movie ! the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is very serious ! in fact , it's also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell . it ain't for the kids , i'll tell you that much . and if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective " kill scenes " , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances . in fact , most of this film's structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and " feel " of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those " unfortunates " ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers . you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time . but it's also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel " from hell " written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? yes , the brothers even managed to slip a little " love " story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . that's right , there's no real need to put any " romance " in a film about a mass murderer ! but that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . sure , he's just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp's character had to do with the film's development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn't ) . on the downside , the film doesn't really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . but then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . i mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one's motives , reasons , etc . . . in fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i'd been held from the film's characters . . . or am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? perhaps . overall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola's dracula and burton's sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . but it's not for everyone . some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren't shown as graphically as you might think , there's enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper's haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr ! where's joblo coming from ? the crow ( 9/10 ) - dark city ( 9/10 ) - dracula ( 7/10 ) - jfk ( 9/10 ) - the nightmare before christmas ( 10/10 ) - the ninth gate ( 8/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - quills ( 8/10 ) - shadow of the vampire ( 6/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) 
jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films . but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film . it's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives . following her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . it is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . cynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her . hortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , " best to tell the truth , isn't it ? that way nobody gets hurt . " . but if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . hence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever " been with a black man " , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . at the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . little lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's " just dropping by " when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look " as bad as possible " to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . there are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , " i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs " ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , " if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . " as played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . but she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps . indeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . the script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . in a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . the film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . however , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives . when cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . 
a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! >from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . 1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big " breakthrough " role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it . however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . and to my surprise , it grew on me . the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out . carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's " somebody to love " , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . ) hell , that's what i do every day . 
the happy bastard's 30-second review : american pie the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest , filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty . if you go expecting dawson's creek , you're in for a problem . if your expectations are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie . the movie casts several unknowns , with the only real recognizable one being sctv's own eugene levy as a happy-go-lucky dad . the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid . that's pretty much it . throughout the movie , little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout , including a memorable scene involving an apple pie ( i won't give it away , but you probably know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry . of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad . most of the actors get their job done , but it's levy who's a hoot , a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious " visual aids " . i couldn't stop laughing during this movie , and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references , then american pie is for you . if you're one of those " conservative " types , well , i'll bet you're having fun at home while this , south park , and austin powers ii plays in theatres , now aren't you ? 
trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter . the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present . sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry . gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers . he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty' . what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife . suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires . dave and gerald too have problems of their own . on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club . there we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them . gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub . in gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men' . the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all . it is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to . it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it . never for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way . while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood . other than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen . however , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying . carlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen . kudos to the people involved in this film , especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just-another-striptease . already a critical and financial success for such a small film , the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout . while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way , the full monty gives one the same satisfaction ? ? . in half the time . 
one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . 
will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence . it's a trait associated with what my brother calls " too good for this world " movies , like phenomenon or powder . forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die . this is no formula movie . in fact , it's quite fresh and original . it's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . will works whatever kind of job he can get . first he's a janitor , then he works construction . off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . he is firmly rejected . finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . lambeau treats will like a son . he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics . he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . will isn't really interested in academia . he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart . meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . it's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's " a " list . will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks . but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . robin williams is excellent in this role . he's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . it is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life . this isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . good will hunting has all three . if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . 
not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement . jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy " tourist " named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good . it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are " don't talk about fight club . " armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke . tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't . hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us . 
* * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * * the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them . the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film . james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film . and i liked each film separately for which it was . now alien 3 is out . and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were . unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off . the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel . this vessel crash lands on fury 109 . everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley . the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash . fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison . when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet . all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years . ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates . as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet . being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons . so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own . i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here . the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story . she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor . yes , after 57 years ripley has sex . it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well . a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film . there is a lot more gore in alien 3 . in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . it also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character . her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination . the rest of the cast is also quite good . notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 . alien 3 has a very distinct look . this is due largely to its director , david fincher . mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here . his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no " alien " film has before . for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry . elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the " alien " series been set in . this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) . this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring . this is a great score . the ending to alien 3 is quite good . there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely . i will not ruin the ending for you . go see the film . i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season . alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien . and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in . 
aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads . the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again . when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson . waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang . as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence . randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance . the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within . i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation . kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one . if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w . griffith ( thematically speaking ) . there is not a single likable character in the film . the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) . the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost . even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects . the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge . what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society . the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable . damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful . his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film . david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) . wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly . sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage . ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed . note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism . the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation . there are no " winners " at the end of this film either . no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began . where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls . it is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely . 
as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . `affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . we see that he is a mean-tempered person . he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . he also has tremendous problems with relationships . he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . but his bearish persona and stature alienates her . he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . finally , he is spiteful and vindictive . as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . he is a prisoner and a slave to it . he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . very effective . today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . coburn displays heft as the bitter dad . but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . there's nothing light or fluffy about this film . that may turn many moviegoers away . but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents . 
steve soderbergh's " sex , lies , and videotape , " which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films . made on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama . the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's . ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) . complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house . ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex . that is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , " sex , lies , and videotape , " it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise . director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's " out of sight " ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's " schizopolis " ) . he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , " sex , lies , and videotape , " is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date . the performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character . she is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic , " short cuts " ) . the other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader's ominous graham , to gallagher's self-involved john , to giacomo's outspoken cynthia . the final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets . suffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception . the film has one fault , however . the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable . if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn't quite as explored as i would have liked . " sex , lies , and videotape , " although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film . soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this . 
it's an interesting premise . our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is " the one " who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . >from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . what is reality ? what is a sham ? the film turns our very perception of life on its side . more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really " utilized " keanu reeves ? more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . very surprising for a sci-fi movie . fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge . hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture . there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . of special note is the use of the " freeze and turn " effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . pretty slick . the matrix drips with style . from the clothing to the music to the action , we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to . much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu , there's a lot of gunplay . when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen . the film is not without its faults . some of the scenes and ideas are " borrowed " a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn't meant to be a joke . however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . 
field of dreams almost defies description . although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie . although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion . and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker . to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : " if you build it , he will come . " then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again . and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights . " if you build it , he will come . " and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates . and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to " ease his pain . " ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society . with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey . the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role . costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life . costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale . amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy ideas . in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p . t . a . meeting , displaying the sincere passion of a '60s berkeley radical . ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe-inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe , the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago " black sox " scandal . and finally , burt lancaster is memorable in a small , but important , role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning . field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life , wonder , mystery , spirit , and humor . it , for the most part , succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief . ray kinsella's spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous . but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama , it unfortunately does at times go overboard , and by the end it gets down-right sappy . in general , however , field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy--one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics . 
call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . shakur and roth play ezekiel " spoon " whitmore and alexander " stretch " rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , " do you expect the world to stop . . . just because you picked _today_ to clean up ? " the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . oh , the irony of it . tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy . gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch " helping " spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again . 
plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side . but this new guy is not like all the others , he's got ambition , he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . violence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue . critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the " great " mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending . here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here . the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! yes , it's all about the suits , fellas . . . the italian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that's ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . but that's not the basis of this movie . the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other . you know how there are always these " hanger-on " gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that is , their boss . so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . of course , director paul mcguigan isn't trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn't over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! ( " look into my eyes ! " ) in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing . scary shite . but there's an ever better scene than that in this film . this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he " does " the guy in his underwear ) . that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . but the flick's not perfect . in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( " . . . so i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . " -it's like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! overdone . ) . i also didn't quite " buy " the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? i mean , c'mon . . . it's 30 years , man ! ! i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me . but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot . forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis . incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal ! note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time . it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . . ; ) where's joblo coming from ? american psycho ( 10/10 ) - a clockwork orange ( 9/10 ) - donnie brasco ( 8/10 ) - fight club ( 10/10 ) - get carter ( 7/10 ) - godfather ( 10/10 ) - godfather ii ( 10/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) - lock , stock & two smoking barrels ( 8/10 ) - pulp fiction ( 8/10 ) - reservoir dogs ( 9/10 ) 
unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he " couldn't care less about the truth " but was more interested in capturing " the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . " despite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( " it's about women not wanting to look like cows " ) to mary tyler moore ( " between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country " ) to style ( " it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs " ) . unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . when the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , " it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . 
capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities . mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness . you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india . the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable . , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi . a wealthy family is having a wedding . an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial . even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together . the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines . aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us . she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor . latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey . dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration . even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants . several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both . there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love . some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films . western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna . on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films . this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english . the latter will , however , help with an international release . sabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog . we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference . director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life . i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) . on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , " bad " deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them . however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing . what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) . think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand . anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens . the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable . in the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , " that movie was so unfunny ! " " i didn't know what to expect . it's like something you chase for so long , but then you don't know how to react when you get it . i still don't know how to react .

cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? they are likely to be remembered for . . . well , quite a while . ? i like this film , too . ? yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . yes , you read that right . armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . so , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . there's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . a . j . and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . i like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . it's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . i won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . bruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . i wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . but the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . it's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . it might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . i'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . 
synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians . meanwhile , the artist's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her . comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it . drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey . mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well-made . it's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about . i've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel . the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film . the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures . to throw a curveball into the fray , billy's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes . a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film . look for alec guinness ( obi-wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper . definately check this movie out ; although , as a word of warning , it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren't for the squeamish . 
" say , any of you know how to madison ? " --- brad " asshole " majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . and immediately tanked at the box office . whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born . for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes . little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either . for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . it goes without saying that the " time warp " is the most popular song in the film . even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . my personal favorite is " over at the frankenstein place " , but " dammit janet " is also maddeningly catchy . tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune " sweet transvestite " need to be heard to be believed . the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( " rose tint my world " , " don't dream it " , " wild and untamed thing " , and " i'm going home " ) , all of which are immensely singable . the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . 25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called " superheroes " . for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab . links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the " behind the music : rocky horror " special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung " hot patootie " . the " behind the music " segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews . as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . one of which is just the " superheroes " number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called " once in a while " . a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick's pants ) . for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is " a different sort of jaws " ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for " toucha toucha touch me " and " sweet transvestite " ) . fox's special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( " you're lucky . . . i'm lucky . . . he's lucky . . . we're all lucky ! " ) . it's not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition .

after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . " you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , " he says , " then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' " of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . then she falls over , dead . for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , " keep eating ! this is the last meal your mother ever made ! " crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the " good guys " come together for the final showdown . in this case , the showdown is against the ramen . if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . 
those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . i haven't even seen that . going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . writer/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . the priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . javert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . basil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . i was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . this film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . thurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . i can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . les miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . it's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . however , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . 
" a breed apart " casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner . a bit hard to swallow ? that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film . hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector . turner is the woman caught between the two men . " a breed apart " isn't a bad movie , exactly . indeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different . the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies . for example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at " his " birds . later on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them . i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn't get involved at that point . another problem is the silly love-triangle that develops . i didn't care one way or the other who ended up with turner . i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions . however , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there's more to life than money and birds . as for hauer , he's an actor i've always admired . he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters . and this one is no exception . he's frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate's clothing , and holstering a cross-bow . despite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through . for example , there's a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early . he comes off as crazy loner in that scene , but a few minutes later , he is apologizing to turner , and we believe his intentions . soon after , we find out he's a vietnam vet , and his actions become fairly clear to us . " a breed apart " isn't a great movie by any means , but it does contain good performances by all three leads , and it's worth seeing for that reason alone . 
it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film . films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut . for years , i have heard of an " international " version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on . but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . until now . the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . mathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a " cleaner . " she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed " too explicit . " i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . there's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe . with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece . director/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello 
the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . one was _gattaca_ . the other was _the thirteenth floor_ . just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ . however , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . a cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered . his associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . _the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . first , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . no wonder it fell through the cracks . done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . despite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . in its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane's husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . although there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw . in fact , hannon fuller's activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane's husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil . the tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . the major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . bierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding . d'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . the lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job . her voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . some minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . there are one or two instances of jerky editing . the script takes the edge off the film's climaxes . the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . one wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi films . one can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : " make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy . " _the thirteen floor_ is that rare exception among hollywood movies : a , rich , emotionally satisfying , intelligent sci-fi movie . and yet , ultimately , it proves the suits right . for when good sci-fi is made , where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it ? if we don't support great sf , who will ? 
as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films . this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school . intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei . meanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail . in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings . in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls . neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival . suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them . an opening prologue in shall we dance ? goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety . it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle . the dance school in shall we dance ? plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities . most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba . sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps . it's a delicate performance with a huge heart . shall we dance ? is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit . suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution . it is here that shall we dance ? feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis . suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together . that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ? conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt . 
seen at the 21st portland international film festival film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film . . . funny and pointed in its own way . if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you . . . . maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through . having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers . and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer . goro has a supermarket . and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket . bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can . goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else . hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market . and the procedures , are not always " fresh " food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves . hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all . and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference . if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store . a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things . as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors . eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown . and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent . in the process , they also find that " freshness " ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined . with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested . but this would take away from the satire and its strengths . with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it . and what fun it is . worth seeing . ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising . we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways . . . . not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else . . . . america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it . . . we could learn something along the way , too . . . . worth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns . the funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films . tampopo is also very enjoyable . all four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them . . . ask for it . 
in the wake of the smashing success of " rumble in the bronx , " it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of " period-piece " martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it . surprised ? well , so was i . drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the " once upon a time in china " movies , but i have not yet seen those . the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of " war and peace " . the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . and so it goes . and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the action . there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected . however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . the primary martial arts " style " featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( " a better tomorrow " 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the " heroic trio " series , " rumble in the bronx " ) . the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong ) . jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii . as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . it's nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . the picture is crisp and clear . one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i've ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . drunken master ii shows the full potential of " period piece " kung fu movies , and it's good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . the plot does meander a bit , but that's to be expected in this type of film . if you like this kind of movie , you'll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . if nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . 
the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane . billy , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble . christopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books . he thinks he's a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports . jack , played by peter boyle , thinks he's jesus . and finally , there's stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases . the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium . during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan . the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast . the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another . henry and jack , for example , fight over who's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game . the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other . michael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity . as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh . although stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing . while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special . lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance . his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character . lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character . the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise . the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot . 
devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire . the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it's basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . sometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) . among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick " doogie howser " harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets . while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from " beverly hills 90210 . " so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? for one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . if starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . it's a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it's a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it's worth . the no-name cast also plays into verhoeven's treatment of heinlein's most controversial conceit . in this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most . verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era " why we fight " series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches . these characters really are just " fresh meat for the grinder , " as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . it's not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . in fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends ) . verhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he's making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . if that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it's enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody's business . verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn't perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn't work out that way . that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . 
linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) " thirteenth apostle " , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . it's a wild ride . they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , " how corrupt are you ? " . wings of desire this ain't . since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . ( not one of them had watched it . ) every single person refused . smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . 
disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan . while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults . fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it's just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time . while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind . but there is trouble on the horizon . the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china . the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army . the only male in mulan's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate . mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father's life . . . by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield . mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d . wong , singing : donny osmond ) . but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized " guardian " dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story . sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it . the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience . but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . the animation is on par with some of disney's best . the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney's recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable . at least , we're only subjected to four of them this time around . mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) . there's nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands . instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies . 
" six days , seven nights " is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . of course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . as his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . the age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by . the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . robin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . the plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . a series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . meanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . at a slim 101 minutes , " six days , seven nights " never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . michael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is " you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? " ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they're all quite engaging . even the movie's more " serious " moments are played with a wink . heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the " believability " of " six days , seven nights " ' heterosexual pairing . ( so she's a lesbian . so what . deal with it . ) of course it doesn't , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . in fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . at one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . after several wrong guesses ( " forty-five ? _fifty_ ? " ) , he whispers his age to her . " you still look good , " heche stammers . " i still _am_ good , " ford replies . she's good too , and together , they make " six days , seven nights " one memorable ride . 
robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force . 1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike . to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one . ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . ) after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . recruits his remains for their new " robocop " program . using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems . the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . 1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre . the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens . robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character . we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot . does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ? the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action . moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine . robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends . as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before . in many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish . however , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off . 
the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . this slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . when the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . as the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . did dolores kill her husband ? and did she kill her employer ? dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . kathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . she dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . kathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . the rest of the cast is also very good . jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . judy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . however , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . however , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . on my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . 
-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . matinee is not like that . i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . he is highly expressive both physically and vocally . i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) while mant ! never got made , many films like it were , and mant ! serves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . this isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . enjoy ! 
films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) . don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . the film , however , is all good . 2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content 
capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be . makes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence . " serial killer chic " is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones . i've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry . i wasn't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero . thankfully , that's not the way henry works . the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work . it doesn't provide cheap-jack explanations for henry's behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him . at the film's opening , henry's friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago . in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers . they are damned together from that moment on . henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun . the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv . the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron . no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker . in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment . the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation . henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting . michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well . the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn't see release . the film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was . i'm hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of " victim " or " hero " . then again , probably , so would henry . 
in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . in simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . in the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . 
you know you're in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question's most normal character . such is the case with " the big lebowski , " joel and ethan coen's first venture since their " fargo " nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods . there's no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because " lebowski " is an effort that makes words like " strange " and " unusual " seem like an understatement . thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success . the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) . one night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that's supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude . once the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long . soon , though , lebowski's trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help . it seems bunny's troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn . the dude , now on lebowski's payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself . chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski's ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) . " the big lebowski " deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that " fargo " did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , " lebowski " is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does . the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , " the big lebowski " is immensely lively . there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it's boring . the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given . bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn't the cleanest guy around , but you'd still follow him to another movie . goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration , as walter's manic temper is one of " the big lebowski " 's many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . sam elliott's rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . and some will recognize peter stormare -- " fargo " 's silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who's really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star . only in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . these flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it's hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . without a doubt , " the big lebowski " is the best film so far this year . sure , we're only three months in and the competition ( " deep rising , " " desperate measures , " " the wedding singer , " etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it's still the gospel truth . maybe during next awards season , " lebowski " won't be a far cry from " fargo .

director : penelope spheeris ( decline of western civilization ii - the : metal years , dudes , & suburbia ) cast : mike myers ( wayne campbell ) , dana carvey ( garth algar ) , : rob lowe ( benjamin oliver ) , tia carrere ( cassandra ) summary : wayne and garth have a public access show called " wayne's : world . " the show is a underground hit , until benjamin : oliver comes onto the scene . benjamin wants to turn the : show into a big hit nationwide , possibly destroying the : essence of " wayne's world " in the process . [expectations - medium] long review =========== i must admit being a bit reluctant going into this film . i didn't believe that they ( mike myers and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half , i figured that perhaps the first half-hour would be great , and the rest would be " fluff . " however , i was really surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending . ( which i won't discuss for obvious reasons , but it's not * that * bad . ) story : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in . alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very " parodyish . " ( okay , bad term . ) extremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle . acting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important . however , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more " canadian " type of mode . ) carvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne . tia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted . lowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about . without a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way . direction : spheeris is a classic " music " movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years . ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least . ) she is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc . one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy . overall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snl's skits to go see this film in the theatres . however , my personal opinion , as in most comedies , is that they work just as well on video . you definately have to be fan of music , and all forms of media in general to enjoy this film . without a doubt , this is the best comedy so far this year . it'll make tons 'o' dough for everyone involved . let's just hope they make a thousand sequels . [sorry , i had to get the lame joke in . . . forgive me . ] 
ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start . a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ? with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ? yuck . but it's not really too bad . it has a lot working against it , for me at least . in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it . it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable . just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip . through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another's way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity . in fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love . the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples . so this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman's model for this film ) . will they get fired from their yuppie jobs ? will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ? will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren't they all ? ) ? will they finally kiss ? well , what do you expect ? but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film . pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show . one word of caution , though . this film is being billed in some places as a " family " movie . don't let that stop you . however , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move . after all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions . all in all , a good , non-offensive date movie . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . 
it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . set in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . soon homer is delivering babies like a professional . he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly . larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer " continues to have such high expectations of people . " such is the result of an insulated upbringing . though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor . tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . . many of which he was unaware needed to be asked . he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . calling them " princes of maine , kings of new england " in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . director lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . regardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . figuring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . dr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . there is a danger in that line of reasoning . god has also given us a set of rules . unlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . and yet , many continue to ignore his " rules " preferring to make up their own as they go through life . " trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . " proverbs 3 : 5 [kjv] just as a builder follows a designer's blueprint or a conductor follows a composer's score , why shouldn't we follow the rules of life given to us by life's architect for our own blessing ? 
seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash . [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life . all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do . therefore , " gone with the wind " deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner . it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself . the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war . this plays a major factor in the film's success . to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy . it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers . can a story set so long ago be relatable now ? the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . it doesn't simply plug in the " right thing " at the " right time , " it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . getting married just to spite someone ) . the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense . acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation . butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . " do we have ammunition factories ? do we have food ? do we have a navy ? all we have is tobacco . " all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong . butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing . scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her . but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is " marked " for life when her first husband dies . this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , " no ! not my leg ! don't cut off my leg ! " another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat . this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . each uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . they say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . all ? none ? either way is possible and it's a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . it's safe to say most of us won't live such overly dramatic lives as those in " gone with the wind , " but it's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we've just experienced a life's worth of joy and pain . 
i swear i have seen the edge before . in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . for once , we don't immediately care for the main character . instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his " personality . " charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . but given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . my favorite line of the film comes from charles : " most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life . . . thinking . " despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore . i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . elle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . she isn't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . harold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . he is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . the edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . some of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . david mamet's script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . it's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . and by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . way to go , bart . 
one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise . " spy kids " certainly did . an adventure story aimed primarily at children , the movie is smart , zippy fun . the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience . the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving . bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence . what a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics . consider the other pg rated " family friendly " movie in theaters now . " see spot run " has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor . body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop . what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film . the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process . at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together . of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells . somebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ? " spy kids " is a welcome antidote to the repellent " see spot run , " using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness . carmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino ) . mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children . what the kids don't know is that they are also former spies . once agents from different countries assigned to " erase " each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family . needless to say , they get drawn back to the business . shortly into their first joint mission , they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) , a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni's favorite tv show . but there is evil behind the scenes , as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children . papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him . back at home , " uncle " felix ( cheech marin ) shows up to reveal mom and dad's secret to the kids . after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them . during the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses . they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop's tv show . they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms , legs and heads would normally be ( why are the guards so ineffective ? because they're all thumbs ! ) they move from one colorful locale to another , including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from " star trek . " the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either " mission : impossible " movie . director robert rodriguez ( " from dusk to dawn " ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes . a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family . alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team , squabbling the way kids do , but coming together when it counts . antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes . even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments ? a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film . had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that , i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) . regardless , " spy kids " is a hoot , offering fun for adults and children alike . and just think , they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle . 
go's is a gloriously slick hip machine . director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive . a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier . in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go . but i digress . go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) . i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . yet entertain me it did . go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable . 
one of the best movies i've ever seen . i'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now . for some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u . s . it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records . after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ? the strength of this film is it's gritty realism . the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes . you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real . i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken . even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase . and the ending . . . . . . whoa . i've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly . the three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific . the 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there . how could they have chosen between these three actors ? there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two . it's impossible . kim bassinger's performance is also a revelation . i'd never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was , well . . . what's the word - a twinky ? that impression has changed , as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly . the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding . no cardboard characters here . the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences . pearce's interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant . i really can't fault this movie at all . i was so glad to see fellow australian's pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie . i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films , but had not seen much of guy pearce . i intend to change this next time i visit the video store : ) 
director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films . you need look no further than die hard ( he was director of photography ) , speed and last years twister for examples of his hi- octane , edge of your seat thrill prowess . speed 2 is no exception . this time , the action takes place on a huge cruise liner , on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship . yep , that's right , no keanu reeves this time , but fear not , jason patrick is more than up to the job . speaking of which , the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist , willem dafoe , from crashing the liner into a huge island , after stealing a diamond collection . the reason for this act of destruction is revenge . after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers , he contracts copper poisoning and is retired . naturally , what entails next is a lot of running/jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day . thinking back on this film , you can't help , but admire it's structure . the way , willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers . the race against time to save the liner from crashing , and of course , the finale chase scence . ( although this is ruined by an over the top , one too many stunt and explosion . ) simple in construction , effective in it's execution , and the result , a clear and concise , highly enjoyable action film . the acting is adequate , although it's darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a 'hot totty' appeal to the men ( and she does that perfectly ! ) , jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist . overall , speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride . not up to it's predecessor's high calibre but very good all the same . there is plenty going on , some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie . 
imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes . so far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere . it is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing . kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department . minutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops . jeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j . t walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner . it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor . jeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight . disconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . there , trouble arises . and i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head . there are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam . it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . kurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . not many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . as an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . faced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . what's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . mostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . contrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . after breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . the villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . the baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . worth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . alfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears . breakdown yields exactly that . it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown .

originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i . e . " talking about love is like dancing about architecture " ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman . plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love . critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties . how do people fall in love ? why do people fall out of love ? how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ? all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships . meet a hip , young couple going through their first date . a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships . a married woman " finding herself " while cheating on her husband . a husband letting go of his inhibitions . an older couple dealing with a past " love " of the man , a secret recently uncovered . a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital . there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity . diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels . some related to the younger couples' issues . others with the married . there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here . and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament . just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels . the actors in this film are all also very , very good . sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations . jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever . anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart . even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination . the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn . the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else . the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood . this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5 . 5/10 ) and happiness ( 4 . 5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness . the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships . all in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless . little known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much . on top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al . ) to do the same . this is director/writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of " adult films " . before this , he had written and produced many children's movies . gillian anderson stands 5'2 . angelina jolie's full name is angelina jolie voight . she is actor jon voight's daughter . she has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute . she divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting ( 8 . 5/10 ) fame in 1997 . they were married in 1995 . actor ryan phillippe's full name is matthew ryan phillippe . he stands 5'9 , and spent his childhood in new castle , delaware . his acting career started on tv's " one life to live " . he portrayed daytime television's first gay teenager . jon stewart's full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz . this film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture . watch for movie posters from swingers ( 8 . 5/10 ) , chasing amy ( 7/10 ) and the texas chainsaw massacre ( 8/10 ) at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date . 
synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . 
" you leave little notes on my pillow . i told you a million times i can't stand little notes on my pillow . 'we are all out of corn flakes - f . u . ' it took me three hours to figure out that 'f . u . ' was felix unger . " --- a frustrated oscar madison ( walter matthau ) running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger ( jack lemmon ) , in the odd couple . the classic neil simon comedy ( based on his own stage play ) about suicidal felix ( lemmon ) , who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar ( matthau ) to stay with him in his apartment after felix's wife throws him out and files for divorce . the hook : oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way , while felix is an obsessive/compulsive neat freak . the two men , despite their friendship , instantly clash . movies just aren't as delightfully funny as this one is . every line of neil simon's dialogue flows like comedic poetry , and all the actors are just perfect in their performances . lemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix , but it's matthau who shines brightest as oscar , whose world is being invaded and rearranged , mostly against his wishes ( the type of character i always enjoy identifying with ) . and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti ? the best thing about the film ( and this is a testament to the quality of the writing ) is that it's a comedy with substance . these two men , even while at each other's throats , genuinely care for one another as friends . when they clash , it isn't cartoonish hatred being displayed , but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co-exist . movies nowadays , take grumpy old men for example , just don't have that extra spark there . these days it's just animosity for the sake of comedy . a television series followed ( starring jack klugman and tony randall ) , which i'll admit i've never seen an episode of in its entirety , and neil simon even scripted the sequel , the odd couple ii , which was released in 1998 . neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though . it's one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films . 
capsule : trippy , hyperspeed action machine from hong kong's accomplished tsui hark . van damme and rodman have nice chemistry , the stunts are eyepopping , and stuff gets blowed up real good ; what more do you want ? i admit i was all set to loathe double team ; it reeked of cheapjack timing-oriented marketing ( stick dennis rodman in a movie , quick , while he's hot , and do something about jean-claude van damme's flagging career while we're at it ! ) . surprise -- double team transcends its dumb roots and turns out to be a mess of fun . bring some friends , get some pretzels , and have a blast . van damme is jack quinn , an ex-agent who is brought back in for " one last mission " -- you'd think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words . but van damme's character has a pregnant wife who's also a sculptor , and some unpleasant pressure gets used to get him to come through on this mission . he's been assigned to take down an old enemy , a terrorist named stavros ( mickey rourke , looking oddly subdued ) , who may be back up to his old tricks . in the first showdown between quinn and stavros , the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve : nonstop action . an amusement park , a hospital , a private " retired spy " 's retreat , most of rome , various houses , planes , cars and other modes of transport , and the coliseum ( ! ) all become arenas for some of the most bone-rattling shoot-outs and punch-outs filmed . they are better seen than described and are reason enough to see the film : one jaw-dropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his * feet * . ( van damme is a good , dextrous athlete and fighter , but he is often upstaged . ) there are other nice touches . stavros and quinn both want the same thing : to retire in peace with their families . that ambition ties them together in various ways , and also humanizes them a bit . one of the things about hk action movies is that there's always some form of human element , and that's carried over into this movie as well . it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable . also good is dennis rodman , playing a weapons dealer named yaz -- a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there . rodman is natural on screen ; he's fun to watch , especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs , and deserves to get a movie of his own , based on what's seen here : a lightweight , fast-moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently .
